        "content": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is waiving the annual service fee for merchants on Tmall and loosening its \"refund only\" policy to reward sellers with good track record on Taobao.\n\nTmall, home to mainly established brands and sellers, from September 1 will waive its annual software service fee that used to range from 30,000 yuan (US$4,145) to 60,000 yuan for merchants in various categories, Alibaba's main e-commerce unit Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG) announced on Friday. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nExisting Tmall sellers that paid the service fee in advance will receive a refund, while new merchants joining the platform after September will be exempt.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nIn a separate announcement, Taobao said that its refund-only policy will be optimised to provide merchants with good track record on the marketplace more autonomy in handling refund requests from customers.\n\nFor merchants with an experience rating of 4.8 and above, Taobao said it will not intervene proactively to support consumers' requests for refunds. Instead, it will encourage the buyer and seller to negotiate, according to the TTG statement. For stores with lower ratings, Taobao said it will give them autonomy in varying degrees.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding's Taobao remains the largest consumer-to-consumer shopping platform on the mainland.

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nTaobao and Chinese rival JD.com offered the refund-only policy in December, following an option that budget online retailer Pinduoduo has had in place since 2021. The policy allows shoppers to receive a refund for a product they are unhappy with, without having to return it. This arrangement has since sparked concern among some sellers about potential abuse of the terms.\n\nWhile that policy has safeguarded consumer rights, it has also been exploited by some freebie seekers who have \"harmed the legitimate rights of businesses\", TGG said.\n\nTaobao's latest move aims \"to create a more positive and healthy e-commerce ecosystem by ensuring consumer rights and improving business environment at the same time\", TTG said.\n\nThese initiatives by TTG reflect the group's efforts to boost support for merchants amid increased competition from main domestic rival JD.com and the challenge from younger platforms such as PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo and ByteDance-owned Douyin.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this year, TTG introduced artificial intelligence tools and functions for merchants to help improve services and attract new customers.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Other retail giants like Walmart and Costco also stepped up their game to offer steep discounts.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) created Prime Day in 2015 to celebrate its 20th anniversary and to boost Prime memberships. Since then, it has grown into a massive global event, with millions of deals across virtually every product category.\n\nAdobe Analytics predicted Amazon's sales to hit $14 billion this Prime Day event, up 10% year-over-year. However, total sales in America are estimated to have crossed $14.2 billion. Furthermore, on the first day of the event itself, total sales crossed $7.2 billion.\n\nAmazon's total revenues are expected to amount to $158.19 billion for the current September quarter, marking an 11.9% rise year-over-year. The consensus EPS estimate of $1.15 for the ongoing quarter indicates a 33.7% increase from last year.\n\nAmazon's shares have risen by over 36% over the past year, outperforming the tech-focused Nasdaq composite Index's 14.5% returns.\n\nWalmart\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the retail giant and Amazon\u2019s biggest competitor, has not remained idle despite Prime Day\u2019s success. Walmart has strategically positioned its sales events around the same time, offering competitive deals to attract bargain hunters. The company launched Walmart Deals to compete with Amazon Prime Day, offering an exclusive lineup of discounts across its online and physical stores.\n\nThis comes weeks after the company hosted Walmart+ week, a seven-day event during which Walmart subscription holders received innumerable discounts on a wide range of products. This summer, Walmart has benefited from the increased seasonal demand as consumer spending ramps up.\n\nStory continues\n\nA survey conducted by Numerator found that 35% of respondents shopped from Walmart during the Walmart Deals event.

To bolster shareholder confidence, Alibaba announced an increase in its share buyback program by $25 billion in May, extending through March 2027.\n\nNonetheless, the Chinese e-commerce company is poised for significant growth in 2024, with projections indicating a 20% increase in gross merchandise volume (GMV) to $60 billion, up from $50 billion in 2023. Alibaba's highly coveted Singles Day event in November is often compared with Amazon's Prime Day and Black Friday.\n\nThe retailer launched \"Alibaba Guaranteed\" in June to garner positive consumer sentiment as part of its growth strategy.\n\n\"Alibaba Guaranteed marks an exciting new chapter for SMEs and global sourcing as it will help to redefine the fulfillment standard of B2B cross-border trade,\" Alibaba's president Zhang Kuo said, \"Global sourcing can be a complex process with many moving parts, but Alibaba Guaranteed can help SMEs navigate it with greater ease.\"\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA): A Good Machine Learning Stock According to Analysts?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Machine Learning Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other feminist stocks.\n\nThe AI boom of the last two years has pushed mathematical computing technologies to the forefront of Wall Street and the technology industry. In its simplest form, AI is a set of programming instructions that allow software to learn from existing data and use this learning to generate new outputs using logic and other parameters. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and it uses algorithms to autonomously learn from data to provide outputs for specific use cases. Machine learning is a subset of AI, meaning that while all machine learning is AI, not all AI applications are machine learning.\n\nSome ways in which engineers use machine learning are via classification, clustering, regression, supervised, unsupervised, and associated learning algorithms. AI, on the other hand, also involves technologies such as artificial narrow AI, general AI, and super AI. Right now, only narrow AI technologies are available, and these are limited to specific abilities such as ChatGPT being able to generate only text based outputs.\n\nFor stocks, this means that AI stocks and machine learning stocks are nearly the same. On the software side of the AI industry, those that develop AI technologies are also heavily in machine learning. On the hardware side, the same firms cater to the computational needs of AI and ML companies. It also means that for a variety of businesses, machine learning is often more suitable since it allows them to develop a customized and autonomous learning approach. And like AI, the industry is relatively nascent. Market research shows that the machine learning industry was worth $15.1 billion in 2021. From 2022 until 2029, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.8% and be worth $210 billion.\n\nThis multi billion dollar valuation for the machine learning industry benefits from the technology's ability to adapt itself to custom business use cases. Research from McKinsey sheds light on some of these, and it also shares details about rapid cost improvements that machine learning users are experiencing. Starting from the use cases, include capital markets and education. In capital markets, machine learning can help financial institutions avoid asset mispricing losses of as much as $950 million. By using machine learning and its neural network subset, banks can reduce operational costs and portfolio risk, increase valuation accuracy, and speed up risk and valuation calculations compared to traditional Monte Carlo and risk valuation approaches.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the education industry, an online education provider used a machine learning model to improve its student drop out (attrition) rates. The model allowed the university to identify three additional student archetypes that accounted for 70% of the students likely to leave their courses. Crucially, traditional linear models were unable to identify these groups, and machine learning enabled the university to develop a targeted approach to reduce attrition. Finally, image classification systems powered by an advanced form of machine learning called deep learning are rapidly improving their costs. Data from Stanford University shares that training costs of these systems dropped by 64% between 2015 and 2021 while training times improved by 94%.\n\nEvaluating machine learning stock performance is trickier since there are no exclusive ETFs or stock indexes that focus onlyon machine learning stocks. Therefore, we're left to use AI stocks as a proxy to also evaluate machine learning stock performance. As part of our research for this piece, Insider Monkey analyzed the year to date price performance of 39 AI stock ETFs. On average, these funds have gained 13.26% year to date while on median their price gains are 11.47%. Their performance ranges between -2.53% to 32.48%.\n\nOn the hardware side, semiconductor stocks are the primary beneficiaries of the AI surge. While their returns have stunned investors, there is some information that suggests that the sector might be overvalued. Data compiled by Aswath Damodaran shows that semiconductor stocks have an EV/EBITDA ratio of 31.6, which is the highest among all industries tracked. These stocks will also benefit from increased attention from the US government, which has earmarked $280 billion for research and production through the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. For AI software companies, valuing them means dividing them by their size and operations. By size, the mega cap stocks have an early mover advantage in the machine learning industry and are generating as much as $4.4 billion in revenue.\n\nDividing them by operations means that there are AI companies that offer cloud capacity by buying GPUs and those that use this capacity. For the former, the CFO of the world's biggest GPU provider shared in May 2024 that for \"every $1\" spent on AI infrastructure, \"cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years.\"\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the top machine learning stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best machine learning stocks, we first compiled an initial list of 150 stocks from three AI and robotics ETFs. Then, repeated entries, robotics, and firms that either do not significantly use machine learning in their operations or operate in unrelated industries were removed. This led to a final list of 78 stocks which were ranked by their average analyst share price target upside. Out of these, the stocks with the highest upside were chosen.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAn e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 103\n\nAnalyst Average Share Price Target: $107.12\n\nUpside: 33%\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the biggest eCommerce retailers in the world. It commands almost 40% of the market in China, which houses the world's second largest population. Its heft, as evidenced by $34 billion in cash provides Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) with adequate resources to weather out a slowing Chinese economy. Additionally, it is also a technology conglomerate, which provides it with revenue diversification through high growth industries such as cloud computing and machine learning. However, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is facing tough competition from Chinese eCommerce upstarts such as Pinduoduo which are doing well in the troubled Chinese economy by offering discounted products and bulk buying offers. Most of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)'s businesses, such as marketing services, travel advisory, and restaurant guides are all cyclical in nature. This means that the shares are vulnerable to more negative news for the Chinese economy, as evidenced by its 2% share price drop in July after the economy grew by 4.7% in Q2 and missed expectations of 5.1%.\n\nAdditionally, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) trades at a forward P/E of just 9.23. This is significantly lower than its American peer Amazon's 40.16. The stark difference captures investor sentiment surrounding Chinese stocks, and continued US China trade tensions particularly when it comes to tariffs and chip restrictions could cause further trouble for Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). Here's what Artisan Partners had to say about the firm in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\nAlibaba shares declined 7% during the quarter. There isn\u2019t much new to say about Alibaba. There was no meaningful news that drove the share price decline. The earnings for the December quarter were fine, with revenues and profits both increasing 5%\u2014not typically an exciting level of growth, but certainly enough to justify the company\u2019s paltry valuation of 4X\u20135X EBIT. As we have written in recent letters, this is a valuation level that is normally reserved for a dying business, and Alibaba is not a dying business. Management continues to implement changes that are intended to increase shareholder value. Over the past year, they have changed management, adjusted the company structure, contemplated spinning off assets, made progress monetizing the balance sheet and have improved the capital allocation. All of these actions have yet to be reflected at all in the share price. This is a stock that could double and would still be cheap.\n\nOverall BABA ranks 10th on our list of the best machine learning stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Machine Learning Stocks According to Analyststo see the other machine learning stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BABA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: This Could Be the Most Underrated AI Stock to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "If you're thinking about buying shares of Nvidia now, one issue you might be finding it hard to get around is its valuation. While the chipmaker's growth prospects are undoubtedly amazing, is the stock really worth paying more than 70 times earnings for? For many investors, the answer has been a resounding yes -- the chipmaker's market cap is up by around 150% this year to $3 trillion.\n\nBut if you're worried that Nvidia's high valuation could limit its returns in the future, then you might want to consider other stocks involved with artificial intelligence (AI) that could have more upside. One worth considering is Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA).\n\nAlibaba is using AI to grow internationally\n\nAlibaba is a tech giant in China, but it has promising growth opportunities in other markets as well. And it's taking a page out of the handbooks of some of its e-commerce peers with its efforts to use AI to make it easier for sellers on its platform to reach customers in other countries.\n\nWith the help of AI, merchants can overcome foreign language barriers, sort out disputes with customers, and easily create descriptions for products. This is similar to how Shopify uses AItools to make it easier for merchants on its platform to reach more customers. Alibaba, however, has the advantage of having its own large language model, Tongyi Qianwen, so it could potentially offer more customized and enhanced assistance.\n\nZhang Kaifu, Alibaba's head of AI development in its international e-commerce business, said that in internal tests, AI tools helped merchants achieve order growth up to 30%.\n\nA big opportunity for the company\n\nThe international commerce segment remains a fairly small slice of Alibaba's overall business, and it could have a lot more room for growth.\n\nDuring the first three months of 2024, Alibaba reported $3.8 billion in revenue from its international commerce segment -- 12% of its $30.7 billion top line. But what was encouraging is that with 45% year-over-year growth, it was its fastest-growing business unit. Chinese commerce revenue was still the company's largest segment, with revenue from Taobao and Tmall bringing in $12.9 billion in sales in that quarter.\n\nBy focusing on international growth in a modestly sized area of its operations, Alibaba can position itself for much greater opportunities for expansion in the future, especially as it leverages AI to help with that growth.\n\nAlibaba's valuation is incredibly low\n\nChinese stocks struggled in recent years due to a myriad of issues, including concerns about Chinese government interference with its domestic companies, and tensions between the U.S. and China. In the past three years, Alibaba's stock fell by 64%, largely due to those concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are discounting the stock severely for risks that may be overblown. China is a huge market and Alibaba is a big name there, with cloud, e-commerce, and digital media business units that give it great diversification. And at a time when many tech stocks are trading at lofty earnings multiples, Alibaba looks incredibly cheap, even based on its own historic levels. BABA PE Ratio ChartBABA PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nOver the past decade, its average P/E ratio was around 36, and over the past five years, it has had an average P/E of around 30. It's well below both of those levels now. The counterargument would be that Alibaba's growth has been slowing down, so it's not worth such a premium anymore. But in its last reported quarter, its sales expanded at a rate of 7%, and if AI proves to be a catalyst for its international e-commerce business, its growth rate may improve.\n\nWhile investors may still be putting a discount on the stock because it's a China-based company, I don't think the stock warrants this much of a discount.\n\nAI investors should consider buying Alibaba stock\n\nAlibaba is an underrated AI stock to buy right now. Its growth rate isn't terribly impressive, but there's still loads of potential here for the business in the long run. While some have been concerned that the Chinese government will take actions that inhibit the company's growth, so far, those moves haven't materialized, and concerns that Beijing will hinder it appear to be overblown.\n\nInvestors who are willing to look past the uncertainty and take a chance on what looks to be an incredibly cheap stock right now could be rewarded with some strong gains in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chinese technology giants Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings have rushed to offer the latest artificial intelligence (AI) model from Facebook owner Meta Platforms into their cloud services, as the debut of Llama 3.1 drew widespread attention this week.\n\nAlibaba Cloud, the e-commerce giant's online computing platform, was among the first to include the latest open-source Llama family of large language models (LLMs) - the technology underpinning generative AI products such as ChatGPT - by integrating it into its Bailian model training platform, the company said on Tuesday in a post published to its official WeChat account. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAlibaba said it is offering one month of free compute resources that can be used for training and inferencing tasks with Llama 3.1, which launched on Monday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nMeta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nShenzhen-based video gaming giant Tencent quickly followed with its own announcement the same day, saying Llama 3.1 is now available on its cloud platform. It includes a number of fine-tuning and inferencing tweaks to ensure Meta's open source models are usable in a range of areas, from intelligent conversation, text generation and writing tasks, according to the company.\n\nMeta is offering the latest version of Llama in three different sizes - 8B, 70B and 450B - that are named after the billions of parameters they include. The number of parameters generally corresponds with an LLM's level of sophistication.\n\nIn its unveiling, Meta hailed Llama 3.1 as \"the first frontier-level open-source AI model\". Early tests have compared it favourably with leading closed-source models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o.\n\nWidely considered the best-performing open-source LLM family, Llama models have become a default foundation model that many Chinese start-ups use to build their own generative AI products, typically with custom tweaks to change or improve performance.\n\nChinese industry insiders have cautioned against an over-reliance on Meta's models among domestic generative AI initiatives. Last year, Chinese AI unicorn 01.AI, founded by venture capitalist Lee Kai-fu, generated some controversy when it was found to be building on top of Llama models without being transparent about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nResponding to criticism that advanced open-source models benefit China, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement announcing the new models on Monday that \"decentralised and open innovation\" advantages the US.\n\n\"Our adversaries are great at espionage, stealing models that fit on a thumb drive is relatively easy, and most tech companies are far from operating in a way that would make this more difficult,\" he said.\n\nWhile open-source models have typically lagged behind the most advanced in the industry, Zuckerberg said he expects to close that gap soon. \"Starting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry,\" he wrote in his statement posted to Facebook.\n\nLMSYS, an AI model research organisation supported by the University of California, Berkeley, currently ranks closed-source models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google as the top as the best performing. OpenAI's GPT-4o ranks No 1, with the three companies' other models filling out most of the other top 10 spots.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Baichuan AI, one of China's four so-called artificial intelligence (AI) tigers, raised about 5 billion yuan (US$687.6 million) in a new funding round that valued the start-up at more than 20 billion yuan, the company said on Thursday.\n\nThe Beijing-based firm's latest round was backed by some of the biggest names in Chinese technology, including Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and Xiaomi, along with some state-backed funds. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nChina International Capital Corporation, the AI industrial investment fund backed by the municipal governments of Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Shenzhen Capital Group, one of the largest yuan-denominated venture funds set up by the southern tech hub's government in 1999, are among the participants.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe sizeable funding round illustrates how local investors continue to pump money into the red-hot AI industry at a time when US funds are steering clear amid geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nFounded in April 2023 by Wang Xiaochuan - founder and former CEO of Sogou, once China's second-largest search engine operator after Baidu - Baichuan has seen its valuation swell past US$2.7 billion in a matter of months, becoming China's second-most valuable AI start-up behind crosstown rival Moonshot AI, valued at US$3 billion and also backed by Alibaba.\n\nChina's biggest e-commerce and cloud services operator has emerged as one of the most prolific backers of Chinese AI start-ups, with stakes in all four AI tigers, which also includes Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax.\n\nAlibaba is actively developing its own large language models (LLMs), as well, which include its proprietary Tongyi Qianwen series and the open source version called Qwen. The push comes as the Hangzhou-based tech giant seeks to entrench its position in what has become a highly competitive domestic AI market.\n\nQwen2 was ranked the world's best performing open-source model by LLM community Hugging Face when it was unveiled just after its launch last month. Facebook owner Meta Platforms is now claiming that title for its Llama 3.1 model unveiled on Monday, underscoring just how fast the industry is moving.\n\nBaichuan's new funding round comes less than two months after it introduced in late May the latest iteration of its namesake LLM - the technology behind chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Alongside Baichuan 4, the company introduced a dedicated digital assistant with the aim of turning its Baixiaoying chatbot app into a super app that can encompass all aspects of a person's digital life, a la Tencent's WeChat.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Cautious Optimism for Alibaba",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) has reported a mix of performance outcomes for fiscal year 2024. While the company's international commerce segment, under the Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) division, has shown remarkable growth, it continues to face challenges within its core markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, Alibaba retains durable competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its leadership in mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics. The company's strategic investments in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers are promising, though their success is not guaranteed given the challenging macroeconomic environment and execution risks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nIn the near term, the stock is likely to remain volatile, reflecting the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if Alibaba can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, shares could potentially return over 30% within 12 months, according to analyst forecasts.\n\nAlibaba's path to growth: International success\n\nAlibaba posted 7% year-over-year revenue growth for the March quarter, but income from operations fell by 3%. Overall net income climbed for the entire 2024 fiscal year by 9%, but results have had to be more consistent recently.\n\nIndeed, it does not feel like stiff competition dented Alibaba's cross-border e-commerce operations. Its international retail division posted solid momentum driven by robust order growth on platforms such as AliExpress. Other initiatives, such as the AliExpress Choice initiative, further boosted performance, which improved the customer experience with better product selection. Cautious Optimism for Alibaba\n\nSource: Alibaba\n\nIn the wholesale space, Alibaba has enjoyed the benefit of delivering value-added services across borders. The Chinese wholesale commerce area is expanding. International commerce net revenues shifted back and forth for the group at $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflected staggering year-over-year growth of 45%, which says a lot about the strong momentum of the company's international businesses recently.\n\nAs a final point, the company has increased its focus on the growth of its AliExpress platform through logistic integration with its Cainiao network. Alibaba aims to increase AliExpress' brand awareness and user experience globally by increasing investments in key markets across Europe and Southeast Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nA $5 billion buyback plan: A bold move amid investor concerns and market challenges\n\nIn May, Alibaba announced plans to raise $5 billion through a convertible bond offering. The company said proceeds would fund share buybacks at $80.80 per share. This suggests management sees value in repurchasing stock at current levels.\n\nHowever, some investors needed clarification on the deal's complex structure. There are also worries over how accessible the new cash on Alibaba's balance sheet will be for general corporate purposes.\n\nAnalysts see the potential for the stock to increase in value, but point to risks that limit the upside or lead to further declines. For instance, Hargreaves Lansdown notes some \"green shoots\" of improvement in Alibaba's business, but progress overall remains sluggish.\n\nSimilarly, Morningstar recently raised its price target for Alibaba by 2% to $96 per share, implying undervaluation. This target is based on expectations that consumer discretionary spending in China will rebound, allowing the company to regain market share and resume earnings growth. However, competition and regulatory hurdles remain top concerns.\n\nThe road ahead: Opportunities abound amid economic and competitive hurdles\n\nWhile Alibaba has promising opportunities in areas like international expansion and artificial intelligence, the company faces an uphill battle with numerous challenges impacting its business.\n\nThe country's gross domestic product growth has slowed to an estimated 3% to 4% annually from the 6% to 7% in earlier years. This slowdown, together with the impacts of Covid-19, weakened consumers' confidence and theatrically trimmed discretionary spending. Less demand among consumers is the last thing a company with a heavy dependence on Chinese retail, like Alibaba, would be concerned with.\n\nTogether with macroeconomic concerns, Alibaba is being competitively squeezed by some business lines. Within Chinese e-commerce, Alibaba has been losing market share to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings' (NASDAQ:PDD) Pinduoduo. The company's operations in this segment are growing only at single-digit rates year over yearpretty slow compared to the hypergrowth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud businesses have attained.\n\nAlibaba Cloud faces uphill competition from dominant players like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. These Western tech giants have far greater global brand recognition and trust than Alibaba Cloud.\n\nBetween economic struggles and fierce competition, there are legitimate concerns about Alibaba's ability to execute its growth strategy. The company's core commerce segment makes up most of the total revenue, so any deeper slowdown here would be very impactful.\n\nAlibaba is trying to expand into new frontiers in China and abroad, but execution risks are elevated given the challenging macro environment. More specifically, the Chinese retail landscape looks particularly challenging in the near term. Given economic uncertainties, consumer discretionary spending remains under pressure. This weighs heavily on Alibaba's massive e-commerce platforms like Taobao and Tmall, which rely on Chinese consumers' willingness to shop.\n\nOnly when broader consumer confidence rebounds will it be easier for the stock to recapture previous highs. Markets will watch closely for signs of stabilization in China's commerce trends. But the environment is likely to remain cloudy in the short term.\n\nThe takeaway: Cautious optimism\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still reasons for optimism if investors take a long-term view. While the stock has struggled recently, Alibaba retains competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics leadership. As China's economy expands over time, Alibaba is poised to benefit.\n\nThe company also has promising initiatives in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers. Significant investments in these areas could potentially pay off.\n\nHowever, Alibaba's growth trajectory remains unclear. Much depends on how successfully the company can execute new growth drivers while shoring up its core Chinese e-commerce operations. Investors need more evidence these investments will translate into profits.\n\nIn the near term, Alibaba's stock will likely remain volatile. The valuation reflects the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if the company can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again.\n\nAccording to analyst forecasts, the stock could potentially return over 30% within 12 months for investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, ongoing economic and regulatory headwinds in China make this a far from sure bet.\n\nUntil China's business climate stabilizes, investors may want to approach the stock cautiously. Consider waiting for clarity on Alibaba's growth rebound before making major positions, but keep it on your watchlist for when Chinese consumption trends improve.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "O\u2019keefe Stevens Advisory, an investment advisory firm, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. Ongoing expectations of near-term rate reduction drove a 3.9% gain in the S&P 500, and companies like Nvidia led this. In the first half, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta increased by more than 10%. Approximately 63% of the S&P 500's first-half surge was driven by just five equities, with Nvidia accounting for almost half of that total. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nO\u2019keefe Stevens Advisory highlighted stocks like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) provides technology infrastructure and marketing reach. The one-month return of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was 3.86%, and its shares lost 19.31% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 22, 2024, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stock closed at $76.64 per share with a market capitalization of $182.097 billion.\n\nO\u2019keefe Stevens Advisory stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"We initiated two new positions during the quarter: Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and Perrigo (PRGO). Both have seen their stocks decline over 70%+ from their all-time highs.\n\nAlibaba is the largest e-commerce player in China, with 40% gross merchandise volume (GMV) market share through its Taobao and T-mall businesses. While the cloud computing business is relatively small, its 37% market share in China positions it well to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-related products. In the most recent quarter, AI-related cloud revenue recorded triple-digit growth y/y, with the expectation that total cloud revenue will accelerate to double-digit growth in 2H 2025.\n\nIt's rare to find a dominant market share business with significant tailwinds trading for ~10x adj. EPS. After accounting for their ~$60B net cash balance sheet, the stock is trading at 6-7x, which, we believe, is far too cheap. We understand this business would not trade at this price if it were a U.S. business. However, the valuation gap at a high single-digit P/E is pricing in a combination of the following risks \u2013 1. China invading Taiwan. 2. Cash can never leave mainland China (disproven). 3. Increasing competition from Pinduoduo and Shien resulting in market share loss 4. China's geopolitical tensions worsen. 5. Economic slowdown stemming from the recent housing market downturn. 6. VIE structure creates doubt over the actual ownership of the business. All risks have merit, with cash distribution restrictions at the lower end due to the recently announced dividend and special dividend. Cash returned to shareholders totaled $16.5B in FY24, up from $13.4B in FY23\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nAn e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is in 23rd position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 103 hedge fund portfolios held Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) at the end of the first quarter which was 116 in the previous quarter. Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (NYSE:BABA) consolidated revenue for the quarter was RMB 221.9 billion, a 7% rise from previous year\u2019s same quarter.

Alibaba recently started investing in some AI initiatives aggressively but we don\u2019t think it is leading the pack.

        "title": "Alibaba International's Generative AI Toolkit Now Used by Half a Million Merchants as API Calls Double Every Other Month",
        "content": "SINGAPORE, July 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (\"Alibaba International\") announced today that about 500,000 merchants have now adopted its generative artificial intelligence (AI) toolkit across more than 40 e-commerce scenarios. Since the toolkit's launch last November under the brand \"Aidge,\" its average daily application programming interface (API) calls have doubled every two months, now exceeding 50 million. At present, more than 100 million product listings on Alibaba International's platforms have been thoroughly refined and adapted into multiple languages with the help of AI, enabling merchants to increase market reach and lift purchase conversion.\n\nAI is playing an increasingly pivotal role in boosting the operational efficiency of merchants on all of Alibaba International's e-commerce platforms. Collectively, these platforms have applied generative AI to more than 40 e-commerce scenarios, ranging from product listing refinement and marketing to customer service, design and process automation. In each of the use cases, generative AI has led to a statistically significant boost in content quality, click-through rates, conversion rates or customer satisfaction\u2014sometimes by double digits.\n\nAI capabilities now extend well beyond basic functions such as translation and generating text and images. Leveraging AI's advanced abilities for customization and solving complex problems, Alibaba International has applied the technology in areas including customer service, chargeback defence and refunds.\n\nIn the area of customer service, the 24/7 availability of AI to deliver instant, informed responses\u2014utilizing data from product detail pages (in technical terms, Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG)\u2014can effectively address customer queries and facilitate shopping decisions. After adopting AI customer service in June 2024, AliExpress Choice, a premium service of AliExpress offering consumers free shipping, assured on-time delivery and free returns, reported a 29% increase in conversion rates from pre-sales inquiries.\n\nAI also safeguards small and medium-sized businesses from financial setbacks caused by the common issue of chargebacks. When a consumer initiates a chargeback, Alibaba International's Chargeback Agent promptly generates a dispute letter on behalf of the merchant involved, drawing upon order information such as payment and logistics details. Alibaba International's pilot application suggests that this tool increases merchants' chargeback defence success rate by 15% on average.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on the initial success, Alibaba International is in the process of launching an AI Refund Agent, providing both merchants and consumers with a more flexible refund solution. With the aim of optimizing customer satisfaction while reducing merchant costs, this automated tool efficiently processes the reasons behind e-commerce transaction disputes and verifies evidence to calculate refund amounts for merchants.\n\nAI also possesses the ability to lower product supply costs for e-commerce merchants. For example, the virtual try-on feature developed by Alibaba International allows apparel merchants to effortlessly create images that display their products on virtual models, all with the simple upload of a clothing item's image. It boasts a broad selection of model styles, enabling diverse product representations while offering merchants a cost-effective alternative to traditional model photoshoots.\n\n\"Global commerce represents a fertile ground for generative AI applications, particularly as LLMs are enhanced for greater multilingual capabilities. It is evident that small and medium-sized businesses stand to benefit the most from AI advancements, enabling them to overcome traditional barriers including the lack of access to talent and human expertise,\" said Kaifu Zhang, Vice President of Alibaba International, who leads the company's AI initiatives.\n\nIn addition to its own platforms, Alibaba International is also working with external partners in the cross-border e-commerce space to expand the reach of AI's benefits. \"We strongly believe that in the e-commerce space, generative AI is a real catalyst to fulfill\u00a0Alibaba's mission: to make it easy to do business anywhere,\" added Zhang.\n\nFor more information, please visit: www.aidc-ai.com\n\nAbout Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group\n\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group is dedicated to supporting the development of global digital trade with AI-powered technology. It operates various platforms with distinctive business models, covering multiple countries and regions around the world.

        "title": "Alibaba (BABA) Rises Higher Than Market: Key Facts",
        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Alibaba (BABA) standing at $76.64, reflecting a +1.82% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 1.08% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.32%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.58%.\n\nThe online retailer's shares have seen an increase of 2.17% over the last month, surpassing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.31% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.43%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alibaba in its forthcoming earnings report. On that day, Alibaba is projected to report earnings of $2.24 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 6.67%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $34.95 billion, up 8.22% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $8.20 per share and a revenue of $138.63 billion, indicating changes of -4.87% and +6.23%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alibaba. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% lower. As of now, Alibaba holds a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nLooking at valuation, Alibaba is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 9.18. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.16, so one might conclude that Alibaba is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nOne should further note that BABA currently holds a PEG ratio of 0.39. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Commerce industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.04 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 60, placing it within the top 24% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Alibaba (BABA) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alibaba (BABA).\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.35, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.35 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy, representing 82.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for BABA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for BABA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alibaba, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs BABA a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.1% over the past month to $8.20.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Alibaba. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alibaba with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other undervalued stocks. If interested, read our recent piece on the 10 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy for Under $20.\n\nRetail investors often discuss their investments on platforms such as Reddit and have become a major market force in recent years. According to a report, inflows from retail investors in the stock market between 2014 and 2019 averaged around $200 million, with a peak of $730 million in 2015. The figure spiked to $1.2 billion in 2020, with daily flows reaching $1.48 billion in 2021. Over the next couple of years, the value of inflows hovered between $1-1.4 billion per day, driven by commission-free online trading platforms and stimulus payments from the government. The surge in investor inflows is also owed to the pandemic, during which low interest rates and bond purchases by the Federal Reserve pumped heavy money into the American financial system.\n\nThe year 2024 has already been a healthy year for the American stock market, driven by a strong performance by technology stocks. Tom Lee, the co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is bullish on the ongoing fiscal year and anticipates the market to triple in size by the end of the decade.\n\nThe two major factors driving Lee's bullish projection were the global labor shortage and a surge in the population of millennials. He mentions how millennials are the largest generation shaping the economy and are set to inherit big as we approach the generational wealth transfer of at least $80 trillion. According to a report, by 2030, millennials will have five times more wealth compared to what they have today. Moreover, the past two incidents of global labor shortage led to major spikes in technology stocks, and Lee is expecting the same again this time. However, he also warns of risks that could undermine his positive outlook, including AI backfiring, global recession, and geopolitical instability.\n\nThis uncertainty about the stock market, coupled with stocks' volatility, makes it difficult for investors to ascertain the true value of the stock they want to invest in. American billionaire hedge fund manager, Bill Ackman, in May this year, discussed the current state of value investors and acknowledged that predicting the durability of a stock is far harder than building a financial model in the world of investment. Responding to a question about the use of AI to analyze stock investments and financial markets, Ackman stated that AI platforms might help in decision-making over the short run, but there is no guarantee that they would continue working over the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nValue investors purchase stocks they believe have a high value but their share prices do not reflect the stock's actual worth, aiming to benefit when the market corrects itself. If the correct stocks are picked, it can lead to hefty returns for the investors through share price performance. One way of picking out the right stocks is noticing what the hedge funds are doing.

One such example is the 10 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe went through several threads on Reddit to identify the most talked about top undervalued stocks according to investors on the platform. After gathering a list of companies, we went through a stock screener to verify that these stocks were undervalued. Then we sorted and listed the stocks in ascending order of how frequently they were mentioned on Reddit for being undervalued. In cases where two or more stocks were level on the metric, we outranked one over the other based on hedge fund sentiment about the stocks in question. Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds for Q1 2024 was used for that purpose.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

It provides business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sales services through global marketplaces, cloud-computing services, logistics, and digital media and entertainment, among other offerings. During the fourth quarter of FY2024, the company beat both earnings and revenue estimates due to a solid show in its international wholesale and commerce retail businesses. The EPS was posted at $1.40, surpassing estimates by 12.9%. Its revenue totaled $30.73 billion, which was 7% higher YoY.\n\nHowever, the company has been struggling for a while. Lackluster financial performances over the past few years coupled with uncertainties in China have hurt the investor sentiment around the stock. Its e-commerce business has suffered as Chinese consumers become more price-conscious amid a global slowdown. Alibaba Cloud remains a significant player but is losing its market share to competitors such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. According to Wall Street analysts, the company's earnings are only expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7% over the next five years.\n\nNevertheless, bulls remain optimistic about the stock rebounding provided the situation improves in China. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)'s share price has been increasing since it shifted back to focus on domestic e-commerce and invested in AI, cloud computing, and expansion into other foreign markets. Shares price has jumped 5% since founder Jack Ma returned to public view in April this year. There is consensus among rating firms about the stock having a Strong Buy rating, with an average price target of $107.15, which will represent an upside of 42.35% from its current levels. Another vital factor driving their forecasts is the company's strong cash flow position; it finished the year with a cash on hand of $34.37 billion.\n\nBaidu analyst Colin Sebastian shared the following remarks about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in May:\n\nAlibaba is focused on recapturing e-commerce market share in China, and capitalizing on momentum in international commerce and cloud computing building on strong growth in cross-border volumes, and accelerating revenues in public cloud.\n\nIt is one of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to Reddit. This is seconded by Insider Monkey's hedge funds data for Q1 2024, with 103 hedge funds bullish about the company.\n\nOverall BABA ranks 2nd on our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to Reddit. You can visit 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Redditto see the other undervalued stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "What's Going On With Alibaba And Other Chinese Stocks On Monday?\n\nChina has made a surprising move to stimulate its economy by lowering key interest rates. The decision comes as the country faces several economic challenges, including weak growth in the second quarter, looming deflation, and a prolonged property crisis.\n\nChinese stocks, including Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), PDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD), JD.Com, Inc (NASDAQ:JD), Baidu, Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), Bilibili Inc (NASDAQ:BILI) are trading higher Monday.\n\nAlso Read: Alibaba and Peers Face Challenges as U.S. Tightens Semiconductor Export Rules\n\nOn Monday, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) announced that it would cut the seven-day reverse repo rate to 1.7% from 1.8% and reduce the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.35% from 3.45%.\n\nAdditionally, China lowered the five-year LPR to 3.85% from 3.95%. These measures aim to boost economic activity and achieve the growth targets set during the recent plenum, Reuters reports.\n\nThe PBOC has also adjusted its lending programs. Starting in July, it will lower the collateral requirements for its medium-term lending facility loans.\n\nNow, banks will need to hold fewer long-term bonds, enabling them to trade more freely and supporting the central bank\u2019s efforts to stabilize long-term yields and prevent a bond bubble.\n\nFollowing the rate cuts, Chinese sovereign bond yields fell, with 10-year and 30-year yields dropping by up to 3 basis points before stabilizing. China\u2019s 30-year treasury futures for September 2024 delivery rose by approximately 0.3% in early trade on Monday.\n\nSeparate reports indicatedthat Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a new AI chip tailored to meet U.S. export restrictions for China, which will boost stocks like Alibaba and Baidu, which are keen on pursuing their AI ambitions.\n\nAlibaba stock lost 22% in the last 12 months as it battles macro and micro headwinds including cancellation of IPOs of its logistics and cloud business and intense domestic e-commerce rivalry from PDD.

        "content": "Since the post-pandemic reopening, China\u2019s economy has struggled to return to its growth trajectory. Still, China is the second largest global economy, accounting for 15% of global exports. With sentiment washed out and trough valuations, it\u2019s time to consider some Chinese stocks to buy now.\n\nIn terms of sentiment, investors are extremely bearish on China, pointing to its real estate issues, slowing growth and geopolitical tensions. However, this could be a contrarian signal that it\u2019s time to consider buying China. Warren Buffet\u2019s maxim, \u201cbe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful, \u201d applies here.\n\nMoreover, the bargain valuations support the bullish thesis for Chinese stocks to buy now. According to JPMorgan Chase research, the MSCI China index trades at 9.4 times forward earnings compared to a historical average of 11.6. Moreover, considering that the S&P 500 is at a forward P/E of 21, Chinese stocks are too undervalued. These Chinese stocks to buy now are high-quality businesses that offer significant upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is losing market share to PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) and Douyin, it remains the largest e-commerce retailer in China by a significant margin. Moreover, the fact that China is the largest e-commerce market presents a favorable tailwind.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce business is still growing at a healthy rate. For the quarter that ended March 31, Taobao and Tmall revenues were $12.9 billion, representing 4% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group segment grew 45% YOY, driven by strength at AliExpress and Trendyol\u2019s expansion into the Gulf Region.\n\nIts cloud intelligence segment, which provides database, elastic compute and AI products, grew by 3%. While somewhat disappointing, AI-related revenues were a huge lift as they accelerated, growing at a triple-digit pace in the quarter.\n\nLooking forward, AI will be a massive growth tailwind for Alibaba. Already, it\u2019s a leader, as demonstrated by the favorable ranking of its large language model, Qwen. This advanced model has attracted over 90,000 enterprise deployments.\n\nCombining the cash flow from its e-commerce businesses and the opportunity in AI, Alibaba is among the top Chinese stocks to buy now. It trades at 10 times forward earnings and is returning value to shareholders through its $25 billion buyback.\n\nYum China (YUMC) A banner for Yum China (YUMC) decorates the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nYum China (NYSE:YUMC) is the largest restaurant chain in China based on 2023 system sales. As of March 31, it had 15,022 restaurants operating in over 2,000 Chinese cities. Its network consists of flagship brands like Pizza Hut and KFC as well as emerging ones like Taco Bell, Huang Ji Huang, Lavazza and Little Sheep.\n\nThere are several reasons why Yum China is one of the best Chinese stocks to buy. First, the valuation is very attractive compared to its historical average. As of this writing, it trades at 15 times forward non-GAAP earnings compared to the 5-year average of 34.\n\nSecondly, the restaurant operator has a multiyear growth runway in China, which is supported by several factors. Increasing disposable incomes in China plus strong brand recognition means Yum Brand can increase locations in China substantially. For instance, KFC, which has the leading market share in China, has no presence in 1,200 Chinese cities, presenting a massive growth opportunity.\n\nThe company continues opening new stores at a rapid pace, with 378 new restaurants in Q1 2024. Management expects to open 1,500 to 1,700 net new stores in 2024 and targets 20,000 restaurants by 2026. The new openings combined with other topline drivers such as menu innovation and its 300 million loyalty program members mean YUMC stock is a buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nOften referred to as the Google of China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is the undisputed leader in the Chinese search market, with a 53.3% market share. Although Baidu has other emerging businesses, advertising is the main source of revenue. In 2023, online marketing services, which represents revenue from Baidu Core online marketing services and iQiyi online advertising services, accounted for over 60% of revenues.\n\nBesides search, Baidu has several emerging businesses that are new growth drivers. Its cloud services division grew revenues by 6% in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Another exciting growth engine is its artificial intelligence, particularly its ERNIE family of models.\n\nSo far, Baidu has emerged as a leader in generative AI with ERNIE and launched several lightweight large language models in Q1 2024. It\u2019s using these capabilities to provide AI tools to support the development of customized models, AI agents and AI-native applications.\n\nAnother boost to Baidu will come from its autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go. In Q1 2024, the service provided about 826,000 rides, up 25% YOY. Moreover, a reported partnership where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) full-service driving would use Baidu\u2019s navigation and mapping services is a positive. Altogether, AI cloud and intelligent driving make BIDU stock one of the top Chinese stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in BABA but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "An artificial intelligence (AI) expert is expected to soon depart Alibaba Group Holding and start his own business, according to sources and Chinese media reports, amid mainland China's growing investor interest in start-ups that could potentially become the next OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT.\n\nAlgorithm engineer Zhou Chang, who worked on the Tongyi Qianwenlarge language models (LLMs), has decided to leave Alibaba's cloud computing unit after seven years at the firm, according to two people familiar with the matter. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nZhou's departure was first reported on Wednesday by Chinese media 36Kr. The report said Zhang was going to start his own business focused on AI applications, without elaborating.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Illustration: Shutterstock>\n\nZhou, who graduated with a PhD degree in computer software and theories from Peking University in 2017, joined Alibaba in the same year and played a leading role in the development of the Tongyi Qianwen LLMs that were released last year. LLMs are the technology underpinning generative AI services like ChatGPT.\n\nHe was also a member of the team behind multimodal AI model M6, which was released by Alibaba in 2021. He reported to Zhou Jingren, chief technology officer at Alibaba Cloud.\n\nZhou's exit from Alibaba Cloud to start his own business reflects China's new unicorn boom that has so far yielded four \"AI tigers\" - Baichuan, Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI and MiniMax - each of which has raised billions of dollars from deep-pocketed investors.\n\nAlibaba has also seen the departure of a number of top AI specialists since last year. Jia Yangqing, who previously led the computing platform department of Alibaba Cloud, reportedly left the company early last year to join a start-up focused on AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Alibaba has emerged as one of one of the most prolific investors in China's future AI champions. The company has backed all of the new AI tigers, including Beijing-based Baichuan, Moonshot AI and Zhipu AI, as well as Shanghai-based MiniMax, according to start-up data service ITJuzi.com.\n\nTikTok owner ByteDance has seen one of the members of its artificial intelligence team leave to start a new venture.

        "title": "7 Hated Stocks Set to Make a Major Comeback This Year",
        "content": "The stock market has been on a tear lately, but not all stocks are sharing in the gains. A handful of industries and outlier companies are driving the broader market rally, while many other stocks have been left behind. Wall Street has severely punished some for failing to deliver this year, resulting in a few unfairly hated stocks.\n\nI see this as an opportunity. Stocks that are hated and trading at a discount today could be poised for a major rebound in the coming economic cycles. I believe in buying companies with staying power and long-term profitability when their shares are weak and holding them for the long run. They rarely disappoint.\n\nThe upside case is even more compelling when stocks get so depressed that the potential downside risk becomes quite limited compared to the possible upside. The stocks I will discuss today fit this profile. I think they are so beaten down that things can only get better. And if the next few quarters go right for these companies, I expect their shares could deliver oversized returns. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on metal placard with marble backdrop\n\nSource: pio3 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been on a rollercoaster ride, but I believe the company is turning a corner. While saying Pfizer is among hated stocks would be an understatement due to the politicization of its COVID-19 vaccines, I see promise in the company\u2019s pivot to other areas. Pfizer\u2019s Q1 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $14.88 billion surpassing estimates.\n\nThe stock surged 4% on the strong results. Analysts at Truist maintain a buy rating with a $36 price target, citing Pfizer\u2019s new drug development. I\u2019m optimistic about tailwinds like the company\u2019s expansion in India to support medical innovation and progress with its once-daily weight loss pill.\n\nWith the stock bouncing off the $26 level, I believe it has found a bottom and could climb higher. Cost-cutting efforts are on track, and the company has raised its full-year profit outlook. While challenges remain as Pfizer recovers from the COVID-19 decline, I see the potential for this pharmaceutical giant to regain its footing and deliver for investors. It also has a 6.6% dividend yield to sweeten the deal.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has struggled in recent years to recapture its former magic, but the stunning success of Inside Out 2 could mark a turning point. I believe the naysayers who claim most media companies have lost their spark are right in many ways. Disney is more than just a media company; its global cultural influence has waned, and blockbuster hits have become scarce.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat all changed with the release of Inside Out 2. It has shattered box office records by becoming the first movie of 2024 to surpass $1 billion globally in just 19 days. This animated sequel is already the highest-grossing film of the year. Perhaps Disney\u2019s Pixar studio can still deliver compelling stories that resonate with audiences worldwide.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic that Inside Out 2\u2019s triumph and Disney\u2019s ambitious plans to invest $60 billion in expanding its theme parks and cruise lines over the next decade could reinvigorate the company\u2019s growth. Disney already exceeded expectations in Q2 2024 with adjusted earnings per share up 30% year-over-year and a raised full-year EPS growth target of 25%.\n\nMany analysts now rate Disney stock as a strong buy due to its long-term potential, and Inside Out 2 could signal the start of a sustained recovery for this entertainment giant.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) has faced challenges in recent years that have disappointed investors and weighed on its stock price. I believe this is largely due to the broader underperformance of the Chinese economy, which has struggled to stage a robust recovery and satisfy equity markets. However, I remain optimistic about Alibaba\u2019s long-term prospects as the company shifts its focus to high-growth segments like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Chinese government has recognized the need to stimulate economic growth, with calls for interest rate cuts on the horizon. This could provide a much-needed boost to consumer spending and benefit Alibaba\u2019s core e-commerce business. Moreover, I see a growing preference among Chinese consumers for domestic companies, a trend that is likely to impact large enterprises in China when choosing cloud service providers. Alibaba\u2019s cloud and AI offerings are well-positioned to capitalize on this sentiment and drive renewed growth. An expected rebound in trailing earnings could also be the catalyst that sends BABA stock higher. Hated stocks: alibaba rebound\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nDespite a modest 5% year-to-date gain, I believe Alibaba\u2019s stock has the potential for a significant recovery if the company continues to exceed revenue expectations. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Alibaba surprised top-line estimates by about 1%. This could be a sign of more to come.\n\nWestern Union (WU) Logo/electronic sign for Western Union (WU)\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nWestern Union (NYSE:WU) has struggled in the post-pandemic era, with its stock down 54% from the pre-pandemic peak. I believe the company could see a significant recovery in the long run as transaction volumes rise following anticipated interest rate cuts. Western Union reported Q1 2024 revenue of $1.05 billion, up 3% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, with branded digital transactions growing an impressive 13%.\n\nThe company is profitable but is saddled with $2.54 billion in debt that carries high-interest expenses in the current rate environment. Moreover, increased migration into the U.S. has not yet translated into meaningfully improved financial results for Western Union. However, I expect we\u2019ll see a sustained recovery take hold once the Federal Reserve pivots to rate cuts, likely within the next few quarters.\n\nMeanwhile, investors can collect a hefty 7.46% dividend yield while waiting for the turnaround to play out. The buyback record is also one of the best I\u2019ve seen so far. Western Union buybacks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nOf the eight analysts covering the stock, none have a buy rating \u2013 but I think they\u2019ll turn more positive as fundamentals improve.\n\nIntel (INTC) Sign of Intel (INTC stock) at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been struggling to keep up with its competitors in the semiconductor industry, missing out on the recent rally and seeing its stock price remain stagnant over the past year. I believe this presents a good buying opportunity for long-term investors, as the current pessimism surrounding the company seems excessive. Intel\u2019s financials are improving, with revenue growth turning positive and profitability on the horizon.\n\nThe chipmaker is also making significant investments in AI chips and has managed to defend its CPU market share against AMD\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMD) advances. If Intel can maintain its execution, I think the stock has a good chance of recovering. There\u2019s also a possibility that if the AI hype cools down and startups face funding challenges, they may turn to Intel for more affordable AI chip solutions.\n\nThe road ahead isn\u2019t easy, but I believe Intel\u2019s recent progress in key growth areas like AI positions it well for a comeback in the next four quarters.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) has been making steady progress on its Thacker Pass project in Nevada despite a challenging market environment for lithium in recent quarters. Just a couple of years ago, lithium was one of the most hyped commodities, but prices have crashed as EV demand slowed and automakers focused more on hybrids than pure electrics.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all doom and gloom for Lithium Americas. The company reported it had $147 million in cash at the end of Q1 2024 and subsequently raised another $263 million. It also received a conditional $2.26 billion loan commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy. Analysts still have an average price target of $6.2 on the stock, well above current levels around $3.\n\nIf interest rates come down fast, EV sales could rebound, perhaps not to boom-time highs but enough to lift lithium prices and stocks like LAC.\n\nEPR Properties (EPR) tiny house figures atop letter blocks spelling out REIT, representing reits to buy. stock predictions. best REITs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) has faced challenges in recent years, with its stock price still down nearly 50% from pre-pandemic highs. REITs overall have corrected significantly, and there\u2019s plenty of pessimism around real estate. No one knows for sure how the sector will perform going forward, but I\u2019m optimistic it can hold up better than the 2008 crash. Smaller family sizes and soaring migration into the U.S. provide tailwinds. Plus, most REITs are already trading at depressed valuations, so further downside seems limited. EPR\u2019s juicy 7.76% dividend yield also pays investors well to wait for a recovery.\n\nIn Q1 2024, EPR beat on both the top and bottom lines. FFO of 75 cents per share surpassed estimates by 13 cents, while revenue of $167.23 million beat by $18 million. Management also affirmed full-year FFO guidance of $4.76-$4.96 per share. The property numbers have been a bit volatile, but they are no longer declining as fast once you average it out. EPR number of properties\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company continues to make progress in diversifying away from movie theaters into other experiential real estate. Thus, I believe the market is overly discounting EPR\u2019s prospects.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market is starting to broaden, with some low-tech value plays helping propel the S&P 500 ahead of the growth- and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 for a change. Undoubtedly, the great rotation from mega-cap tech to other less-heated parts of the market, including the small- and mid-caps, may begin a prolonged breather for the Magnificent Seven and equally hot semiconductor firms.\n\nAs for the cloud computing stocks, I see ample room for a rebound runway, especially regarding the names at or around 52-week lows (or, in some cases, multi-year lows). As the top cloud innovators tap into artificial intelligence (AI), perhaps the less-appreciated cloud laggards benefit from the market\u2019s broadening out in the year\u2019s second half.\n\nHere is a trio of undervalued cloud stocks that look too cheap as we progress through the third quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nData warehousing firm Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) is close to multi-year depths at $136 and change per share. SNOW stock has been under extreme pressure as more details arose from recent data breaches affecting some Snowflake customers.\n\nMost notably, Snowflake client AT&T (NYSE:T) got caught up in the historic data breach. Notably, the breach wasn\u2019t due to an issue with the Snowflake platform but rather an issue with \u201cexposed credentials.\u201d Either way, the situation isn\u2019t good for Snowflake as the firm looks to turn the tide.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the breaches, many investors may be inclined to cut their losses in a name that can\u2019t seem to hang onto any gains.\n\nWhether talking about the big data breach, the CEO change made earlier this year, or the softer, forward-looking guide, you don\u2019t need to look far for reasons to sell the cloud data stock right here while it\u2019s a falling knife.\n\nThe stock is oversold for investors looking to snag a bargain in a name that is still a (small) part of the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B, BRK-A) portfolio. Snowflake is a cloud AI play that could surprise investors.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is a security firm that has been on the mend for around a year and a half. Despite rolling over this Spring, ZS stock is still up more than 33% over the past year. The dip seems more than buyable for investors comfortable with Beton, a relatively small large-cap with a market cap close to $30 billion.\n\nThough a smaller cybersecurity player, Zscaler has unique growth catalysts that could help it gain power. Apart from rising cybersecurity demand from every publicized breach, Zscaler also stands to gain from smart collaborations with firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and a more focused go-to-market strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if IT cloud budgets stay softer for longer, Zscaler\u2019s security solution stands out as a relatively easy sell in a time when cybersecurity angst is everywhere. At 60.9 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), ZS looks quite lofty. If the company can get AI right, the name may be worth the premium.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese tech giant Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stands out as one of the cheapest cloud and AI stocks in the global market right now. With BABA stock still down around 74% from its 2020 all-time high, the name stands out as a deep-value play, even given the geopolitical risks associated.\n\nAt the time of writing, BABA stock is trading for 18.19 times trailing P/E. Such a depressed multiple seems to discount Alibaba\u2019s potential AI prowess. With new generative AI translation tools recently rolled out to international merchants, it\u2019s about time we view the firm as every bit as AI-savvy as its U.S.-based tech rivals.\n\nWith Alibaba Cloud AI and an unstoppable presence in the Chinese market, perhaps it\u2019s time to bottom-fish for BABA stock, even if it means riding the rough tides out for another year or two.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Berkshire Hathaway (Class B) and Snowflake.

Still, the Asia-Pacific area shows notable development, particularly in China, with a fast increase in cloud infrastructure investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe three \u201cStrong Buy\u201d cloud stocks we\u2019ll explore come from these fast-growing regions.

AWS\u2019s first-quarter 2024 revenue was $25 billion, up 17%.\n\nIn 2024, Amazon will undertake various division projects to boost its cloud computing products and market position. Additionally, AWS\u2019s capital spending on infrastructure development, including generative AI, will \u201cmeaningfully increase\u201d in 2024.\n\nAWS is giving $50 million to the Generative AI Impact Initiative, which is aimed at groups in the public sector. This two-year program aims to help these companies speed up their growth by using AWS\u2019s creative AI services and infrastructure.\n\nAWS released Amazon Bedrock in October 2023. This managed service provides a single API for large language models from major AI organizations. Amazon Bedrock allows model tweaking, multistep generative AI tasks and safeguards.\n\nAWS also introduced five capabilities to manage the machine learning service Amazon SageMaker.

With over 35 integrations with Google Cloud, Datadog can better handle services like Google Vertex AI, Security Command Center and Google Cloud SQL.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA), despite its reputation as the Amazon of China, is up just 5% in the year thus far, as the markets reflect the regulatory and competitive challenges BABA is facing. In addition, the growing US-China trade tensions are also dampening interest in Chinese stocks, but ignoring BABA is folly, especially when considering its potential upside of 32%.\n\nReaching RMB 25.60 billion, Alibaba Group\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group noted a 3% quarterly sales rise. Public cloud services and income connected to artificial intelligence drove the expansion. Furthermore, over 90,000 companies have embraced Alibaba Cloud\u2019s proprietary large language model, attesting to the division\u2019s explosive expansion.\n\nWith discounts of up to 59% for overseas clients, Alibaba Cloud also revealed a significant price drop for its main public cloud offerings.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba opened its first Product Innovation Center and Partner Management Center outside China.

Additionally, the US is considering further sanctions on specific Chinese chip companies.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Alibaba Co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai told SCMP that China lags two years behind the U.S. in the race for AI development, mainly due to Washington\u2019s technology restrictions.\n\nTsai emphasized that U.S. export restrictions have significantly affected Alibaba\u2019s cloud business and its ability to offer high-end computing services.\n\nAlibaba and its peers are already bearing the brunt of China\u2019s economy growing slower than anticipated in the second quarter. This growth is hindered by an ongoing property slump and job insecurity, which are slowing recovery efforts.\n\nPrice Actions: BABA shares traded lower by 0.09% at $78.31 premarket at the last check Wednesday.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Alibaba (BABA) closed at $78.38, marking a +0.47% move from the previous day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.64%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 1.85%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.2%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 4.64% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.58% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.82% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Alibaba in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.24, indicating a 6.67% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $34.95 billion, reflecting an 8.22% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nBABA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.20 per share and revenue of $138.63 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -4.87% and +6.23%, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Alibaba. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% lower. Alibaba is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nDigging into valuation, Alibaba currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.52. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.35.\n\nWe can also see that BABA currently has a PEG ratio of 0.41. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The Internet - Commerce was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.08 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 59, putting it in the top 24% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Less than two years ago, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit lows of $90 per share. Now, the company is a trillion-dollar titan at nearly $500 a share. Many of us, whether short-term or long-term investors, look forward to the day we can get lucky enough to hit a multi-bagger like META. However, there are plenty of other social media stocks worth your investment. Having said that, how do you find them?\n\nOne of the best ways to do so is through a simple investment strategy known as Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP).\u00a0With GARP, investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals, a large moat usually attached to market share, margin expansion, and high revenue growth.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll cover stocks that I believe have a setup that META had in 2022. By using the GARP principles, these three stocks could be social media multi-baggers in the making!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing an AI innovator, search engine giant, and social media superstar, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is truly one-of-a-kind. This unique moat has positioned Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the world by market cap.\n\nThe company has an 81.95% market share in the search engine industry with its subsidiary, YouTube, holding a market share of 97.67%. Not surprisingly, Alphabet\u2019s financials are stellar with 57.2% year-over-year net income growth and 15.4% year-over-year growth in revenue to $80.54 billion. Its balance sheet holds just $30 billion in total debt compared to $110 billion in cash & equivalents.\n\nSo how is Alphabet continuing to fuel growth as a $2.3 trillion company? First, Alphabet is cost-cutting, having laid off more than 12,000 employees in 2023 alone. This contributed to its operating margin increasing to 32% from 25%. Second, it\u2019s heavily investing in its technical infrastructure to support AI and Cloud growth. In Q1 alone, Alphabet\u2019s CapEx was $12 billion, driven by investments in servers and data centers to develop its Gemini models. Lastly, Google is integrating this AI infrastructure into its current product line. YouTube cycles a host of generative AI tools, which led to 50% more channels uploading YouTube Shorts. This led to a 21% year-over-year rise in ad revenues.\n\nSpotify Technology SA (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a market share of 30.5%, Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) is the leader in the music streaming market. It is also second in the podcast market, housing 28.2% of podcast listeners. This only adds to the company\u2019s extensive monthly active user (MAU) count of 615 million with 44% of them using the platform daily. This reinforces Spotify\u2019s networking effect: as more users use the platform, friends and family will join as well. Features like Spotify Wrapped add a true social dimension to the app.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonthly active users reach new all-time highs growing 19% year-over-year leading to quarterly revenues of $3.64 billion up about 20% year-over-year. Starting in July, the company announced price hikes for its individual, duo, and family plans by 9%, 13.3%, and 17.7% respectively.\n\nProvided that the company has had a historical monthly churn rate of just 2% and given that its customer conversion rate is 44%, I do not believe these price hikes will significantly impact the company\u2019s user base. SPOT trades at 3.9x sales and has a 0.8-forward Price to earnings ratio divided by its annual EPS Growth (PEG ratio). This is low relative to other music streamers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 1.39 or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 2.8.\u00a0This is easily one of the best social media stocks on the market.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent (NASDAQ:TCEHY), is China\u2019s largest company and operates in social media, gaming, and eCommerce. While the company\u2019s revenues have grown by 26% since 2020 the stock is down 50% from its all-time high.\n\nIt has a staggering 47% market share in the global gaming industry. Tencent\u2019s WeChat super-app hosts 1.3 billion monthly active users. This is nearly twice the users of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) which has 676 million monthly active users. Net margins were up 50% quarter-over-quarter driven by improved digital advertising through its AI-powered ad targeting.\n\nTencent has a stellar lineup of games including Fight of Golden Spatula which broke mobile records in China. Other games under Tencent\u2019s umbrella include Valorant, PUBG Mobile, and League of Legends. With more than 140 games and $135 million in annual gross revenue per game, any new release adds to Tencent\u2019s high-margin top-line growth.\n\nAt first glance, TCEHY trades at more than double the EV/EBITDA of peers like Baidu and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). But stronger growth metrics justify shares trading at 14.62x and 16.4x forward earnings. Quarterly revenue growth grew six times that of Baidu\u2019s while net profit margins are 50% higher than BABA.\u00a0If you are looking for the top social media stocks, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 5.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.24 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.9%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.15 indicates a change of +11.6% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for BABA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $34.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.2%. The $138.63 billion and $148.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.2% and +7.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $30.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +12.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows in July",
        "content": "Cloud computing is key to modern technologies. Enterprises across industry verticals are pursuing digital transformation strategies in order to facilitate cost synergies. A core part of digital transformation is cloud migration. That is, instead of buying and maintaining servers in-house, businesses have begun to purchase cloud-based products that rely on the power of remote servers elsewhere. Reduced capital expenditures are just one upside to the adoption of cloud computing. Also, via the cloud, enterprises can gain more scale with their core business resources since the global (e.g., firmwide) deployment of such essential applications, services and updates is possible.\n\nCloud computing has been pivotal to the rise of another novel technology: artificial intelligence (AI). AI requires heavy amounts of server power for large language model (LLM) workloads. Because firms are rushing to implement generative AI technologies into their own workflows or products, cloud computing stocks have largely rallied.\n\nHowever, there are still some cloud computing stocks at all-time lows. Below are three of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first cloud computing stock to make this list is China\u2019s Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). The e-commerce and cloud computing giant has made quite a name for itself over the past decade. Not only had the Jack Ma-founded company become China\u2019s most prolific logistics and e-commerce platform, but Alibaba has gone well beyond that with mass investments into data centers. Alibaba\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group continues to be number one in infrastructure-as-a-service market share in the Asia Pacific. In the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, there are even more positive developments.\n\nCloud revenue increased 3% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis to 25.6 billion yuan\r\n(~$3.5 billion). In a press release, management noted that during the quarter, \u201ccore public cloud offerings,\u201d which include products such as databases and AI products, experienced double-digit YOY revenue growth. Alibaba also expects to continue to wean off what it calls \u201clow-margin\u201d contracts and pivot towards supporting demand for migrating AI workloads in the cloud.\n\nBABA shares are down more than 14% from where they were a year ago, and the selling pressure is even more stark if you\u2019re looking over the past 5 years. Despite some structural hurdles, BABA remains a technology giant with solid fundamentals and growth tailwinds.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is another Chinese technology giant not only trading at a 52-week low but also boasting a cheap valuation. Many Chinese technology companies came under fire towards the end of 2020 when China\u2019s government imposed a slew of regulations to reign in the tech sector. The government even shelved Alibaba affiliate Ant Group\u2019s $37 billion initial public offering (IPO) in November 2020. Despite the crackdown being largely in the past, it led to an unprecedented $1.1 trillion wipeout of Big Tech Chinese market capitalization value, including that of Baidu. For those who don\u2019t know, Baidu is essentially China\u2019s primary search engine, like Naver is for South Korea and Google is for much of the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu also began to invest heavily in developing artificial intelligence technologies way back in the early 2010s, similar to its U.S. tech counterparts. The search engine giant has struggled to recharge growth after the pandemic lockdowns. \u201cCore\u201d revenue, which includes the firm\u2019s advertising business, increased 4%, but the \u201cAI Cloud\u201d division grew at a higher 6% YOY. Baidu\u2019s AI Cloud business primarily includes its set of ERNIE LLMs and the company\u2019s deep learning developer\u2019s platform, PaddlePaddle.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been the primary customer relationship management (CRM) platform, HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has been vying for a share of the market. HubSpot also provides a cloud-based CRM platform for businesses in the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific. The company\u2019s CRM platform includes the key product, Marketing Hub, marketing automation and email, social media, SEO and reporting and analytics tools. Moreover, Sales Hub helps businesses better track their conversations with clients and automate meeting and call scheduling tasks.\n\nDespite the uncertainty in the macroeconomy, HubSpot has shown its platform does have a true value-add for the small- and medium-sized businesses that use it. Subscription revenue, which accounts for 98% of the company\u2019s total revenue, grew by 23% in the first quarter of 2024. HubSpot has also been quick to implement generative AI tools, which has probably increased the usefulness and attractiveness of the platform overall.\n\nHUBS shares are down 13% over the past 12 months, meaning the company could be a buy for certain investors wanting exposure to a growing CRM platform.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks Down 42% to 75% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The bull market continues to rage on in 2024, with the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite up 24% year to date. Investors looking for discounted stocks that could join the rally are in the right place. Here are three stocks of industry-leading companies that could be ready for big moves.\n\n1. Carnival\n\nTravel companies have experienced strong demand over the last few years, and Carnival(NYSE: CCL) continues to look like one of the best stocks to profit from this trend. It operates several brands beyond its namesake Carnival Cruise Line.\n\nIt owns AIDA Cruises, Costa Cruises, Cunard, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises, which makes Carnival the largest cruise company in the world.\n\nThe stock has doubled since 2022 but is 75% off its pre-pandemic peak. The disruption that the coronavirus caused to the travel industry forced Carnival to take on a lot of debt to fund operations, which has weighed on the stock's performance, but the company's improving prospects on top of healthy demand trends is a catalyst for the shares.\n\nManagement is intently focused on improving efficiency throughout the business to boost profits. It has invested in more fuel-efficient ships in recent years and optimized its pricing strategy to maximize margins.\n\nIt also announced earlier this year that it will consolidate P&O Cruises Australia into Carnival Cruise Line, which will increase capacity for one of the company's best-performing brands.\n\nThe company reported a noticeable jump in operating profit last quarter, and more improvement should benefit the stock. Shares trade at a modest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 15.5. This is an attractive valuation considering Wall Street's expectation for earnings to increase sharply over the next few years.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has grown into one of the most recognized brands in the auto industry, which is a remarkable feat. The electric vehicle (EV) company was generating annual revenue of just over $400 million in 2012, but last year its sales topped $96 billion, which is impressive on its own considering the macroeconomic headwinds like inflation and higher interest rates that have weighed on consumer spending lately.\n\nAfter falling 42% from its previous peak, Tesla stock has risen sharply over the last month. While the valuation looks very expensive, currently sitting at a forward P/E of 96, there are a few reasons this could be the beginning of a new bull run.\n\nHigher interest rates have made it more expensive to finance the purchase of a new car, which contributed to slowing sales growth and a slumping share price last year. But the company said second-quarter deliveries were up 15% over the previous quarter, which could be the start of a trend, especially since the company continues to deliver more Cybertrucks.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith only 1.7 million vehicles delivered over the last year, Tesla still has a lot of room to gain market share in an industry with over 80 million vehicles produced each year. This is why management is working on increasing manufacturing capacity, including expanding production of its own batteries to secure the supply chain of this crucial component.\n\nWhile the company continues ramp up production of the Cybertruck, there are plenty of other looming sales opportunities that could drive the stock higher in the coming years, including the Cybercab, Tesla Semi truck, and humanoid robots -- all reflecting Tesla's growing investment in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nAlibaba Group(NYSE: BABA) is the largest online retail business and cloud service provider in China. It also has an expanding e-commerce presence overseas with AliExpress.\n\nAlibaba doesn't sell goods itself but generates revenue from charging service fees to merchants that list items for sale on its popular e-commerce marketplaces. It is a profitable business that is a screaming buy at these bargain-basement share prices.\n\nThe stock has fallen 75% from its previous high due to slowing sales growth amid a weakened Chinese economy. Alibaba has also faced stiffer competition from rival e-commerce companies like PDD's Temu and JD.com. But sales trends are looking better in 2024.\n\nIt's starting to fight back aggressively against competitors. Lower prices helped drive increases in buyers and purchase frequency last quarter. Meanwhile, Alibaba's international expansion efforts are going well, with revenue from the digital commerce segment up 45% year over year last quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Alibaba's cloud business is still struggling to pull out of its slump. Revenue grew just 3% year over year last quarter, which pales in comparison to the double-digit growth of other world-leading cloud companies.\n\nBut recent efforts to lower product pricing and integrate the Tongyi Qianwen 2.0 large language model, a type of AI model that can learn to write text and create images, shows potential for Alibaba Cloud to return to the double-digit growth it enjoyed a few years ago.\n\nThe stock is up 17% off its 52-week low, but still trades at an ultra-cheap forward P/E of 9 times this year's earnings estimate. It could double in value and still trade at a discount to the S&P 500's average P/E multiple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carnival Corp. wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com Were Down Today",
        "content": "Shares of Chinese tech stocks Alibaba(NYSE: BABA), Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU), and JD.com(NASDAQ: JD) fell on Monday, down 2%, 5.9%, and 5.3%, respectively, in Monday's trading session.\n\nThe downdraft in China-oriented consumer tech names appeared entirely to do with the disappointing economic data that came out of China today.\n\n\"Only\" 4.7% growth\n\nIn the second quarter, China reported just 4.7% economic growth, well below the 5.3% last quarter and below the 5.1% growth that analysts were expecting. While 4.3% growth may seem very strong, remember that, first, China is supposed to be an \"emerging\" economy and post growth rates above those of developed countries, with its government having set a target of 5% growth. Second, the country was lapping a very low base off last year's depressed numbers, making this miss highly disappointing.\n\nEven worse for these companies in particular, the majority of that economic growth seemed to be concentrated in industrial production and exports sectors. Meanwhile, China's consumers still appear to be in a depressed mood. Retail-sales growth in June came in at just 2%, below the forecast of 3.3%, reflecting both a decline in tourism and Chinese consumers holding back. Initial reports out of the 618 shopping festival held every June also showed less-than-expected growth.\n\nThat likely spells disappointing Q2 earnings from these three companies when their numbers are released in July or August.\n\nEven though Alibaba was down the least today, a sour mood among Chinese stocks could further limit or delay its planned IPOs of its cloud unit and its logistics unit, whose IPOs have already been scrapped once, each over the past year amid a depressed market.\n\nLike Alibaba, Baidu is also investing in artificial intelligence R&D, but its main business is still levered to the Chinese consumer. Its core search engine is dependent on online marketing, and its other main business is a controlling stake in iQiyi(NASDAQ: IQ), one of China's leading streaming services. While digital marketing was slightly up last quarter, iQiyi reported a 5% decline.\n\nMeanwhile, JD.com is highly concentrated in consumer e-commerce but especially big ticket items like electronics and appliances. With those items likely seeing depressed demand amid a tough consumer environment, it's no wonder JD shares trended lower today as well.\n\nChinese tech stocks were cheap and just got cheaper\n\nThe big question is whether these Chinese tech stocks are great value opportunities or value traps. After all, many of these once high-flying tech leaders now trade at just single-digit multiples of earnings estimates. Some\u00a0have been quite bullish on Chinese stocks of late, including famous value investor David Tepper, as well as macroeconomic analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile one day doesn't make a trend, it's clear that there continues to be difficulties turning China's consumer economy around after \"zero-Covid\" lockdowns, the country's property-sector bust, and the regulatory clampdown on large tech companies.\n\nChina has introduced interest rate cuts and measures to shore up the ailing housing sector in recent months, but more is probably needed. Today's economic-data release seems to bear that out. China's Politburo is likely to introduce new measures to stimulate growth later this month, so interested investors should tune into that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Several artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have gone parabolic in the past few years thanks, in part, to investor excitement about the potential of the technology. Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are two prime examples. Their ability to tap into the current AI zeitgeist has pushed investors to bid these stocks massively higher.\n\nThe question for investors only now starting to explore AI-related investing is what other stocks will see such gains going forward. While no company or analyst can say for sure, a few AI stocks are showing potential.\n\nInvestors who want to get in on such growth early might want to give added consideration to Chinese tech giant Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and data engineering company Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD). Here's why these two AI-related stocks could go parabolic.\n\n1. Alibaba\n\nAmid strained U.S.-China relations, U.S. investors seem to have shied away from Alibaba. Granted, this stock comes with risks. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considered barring Chinese stocks like Alibaba back in 2022 if government access to account auditing data was not granted. Moreover, investing in Alibaba means buying an American depositary receipt (ADR) rather than an actual share, meaning its stock is an investment in a holding company tied to the parent corporation, rather than the company itself. While such international stocks are generally safe, deteriorating U.S.-China relations could undermine the ADR's status.\n\nInvestors know Alibaba best as a retailing giant. Indeed, it remains one of the top retailers in China, and much of this market of 1.4 billion people remains untapped.\n\nStill, as one of the world's leading cloud computing providers, it plays a critical role in China's AI industry. It combines its cloud AI with a data intelligence platform to solve problems through algorithms. It also supports generative AI through its Qwen model, which can process natural language, interpret images, and provide APIs to build generative AI applications. Image source: Statista.\n\nThanks to steady improvements across retailing and the cloud, Alibaba earned 71 billion yuan, also known as the renminbi, ($11 billion) in fiscal 2024 (ended March 31, 2024), more than triple the 23 billion yuan ($3.2 billion) in fiscal 2014, the year it IPO'd.\n\nHowever, on balance, Alibaba stock fell by 20% during its 10 years of trading, meaning the stock price incorporated none of the earnings growth during that time. Additionally, it trades at a P/E ratio of 17, far below peers in other regions such as Amazon, which sells for 56 times earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, the geopolitical issues tied to Alibaba make it a stock that risk-averse investors should probably avoid. Nonetheless, if the company or various governments can ease concerns about Alibaba, the stock could go parabolic as it prices in years of massive growth. That holds potential for investors with some risk tolerance.\n\n2. Innodata\n\nAt first glance, Innodata may look like the software version of Super Micro Computer. It started trading in 1993, and until mid-2020 it struggled to sustain any stock price gains. But like Supermicro, its fortunes changed in the past few years thanks to AI.\n\nThe data engineering company develops low-code software platforms that apply AI-driven processes to data collection, digital transformation, and business processes tailored to specific industries. Its software leverages this technology to automate processes, perform manual tasks faster, and free workers to spend more time on creative and analytical work.\n\nThanks to the optimism surrounding this technology, Innodata stock is up over 1,670% in the last five years and trades near all-time highs set this month. However, at a market cap of just under $500 million, investors still have a chance to get into the stock early.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, revenue of $27 million rose 41% from year-ago levels. This compares favorably to 2023's revenue growth of just 10%. Also, thanks to efforts to slow cost and expense growth, the company earned almost $1 million, up from a $2.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMoreover, Innodata expects these top- and bottom-line improvement trends to continue as it forecasts a minimum of 40% revenue growth in 2024. Such a change likely explains why the stock has roughly doubled in value since the beginning of the year.\n\nAdmittedly, that increase has taken its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to record highs, but at a 5.5 sales multiple, it compares well to most other AI stocks. Considering its growth potential, investors might wish they had bought Innodata at 5.5 times sales if greater awareness continues to push the stock price higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Billionaires Are Buying These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has not escaped the attention of billionaires. As opportunities emerge, investing disclosure requirements show they have deployed significant amounts of capital into AI stocks like Nvidia.\n\nThis is important because some investors follow the lead of these top-tier investors and mimic their transactions hoping for similar results. While these billionaires buy stocks for many reasons that have little to do with the investing goals of their followers, fortunately, their positions do occasionally benefit average investors, especially if they happen to pick some solid stocks to get behind.\n\nLet's take a look at three billionaires and explore why they took positions in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The exercise might lead to some insight that can be useful to your investing journey.\n\n1. Alibaba\n\nAt first glance, investors may find it puzzling that Appaloosa Management, the fund run by billionaire David Tepper, took a position in Alibaba. In 2022, the stock faced a delisting threat when the Chinese company resisted allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to see its internal financial audits because of its association with the Chinese Communist Party. Although the U.S. and China eventually resolved that issue, the tenuous relationship between the countries put tremendous pressure on the stock.\n\nAs a result of the turmoil, Alibaba's stock price fell to almost 20% less than its initial public offering (IPO) price from 10 years ago. This drop comes despite Alibaba's net income more than tripling over that time. That caused its P/E ratio to fall briefly into the single digits, and its current earnings multiple of 18 is far below any comparable conglomerate.\n\nWith the stock trading at a heavily discounted price, Tepper increased the size of his Alibaba position by more than 11,000% over the last year. The markets may vindicate this move over time. The stock price has remained steady so far this year, though it is down about 75% from its 2020 high.\n\nStill, if Alibaba can find a way to ease investor concerns, Tepper's fund and those who invest along with him could experience a significant payday as the stock finally prices in its growing profits.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been a top AI innovator since it introduced the technology to its Google Search platform in 2001. Nonetheless, AI investors soured on the stock when OpenAI introduced a vastly improved version of ChatGPT in early 2023, creating the impression that the Google parent was behind the curve.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors like Bill Ackman saw this as a buying opportunity, so much so that 13% of his Pershing Square portfolio is tied up in this stock. As late as the fourth quarter of 2022, Pershing Square did not own any Alphabet stock.\n\nBuying at the time Pershing Square did may have been the right move. More recently, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI product, Google Gemini. It has also combined its AI research under the Google DeepMind umbrella. Considering its $108 billion in liquidity, it will likely buy any AI innovation it cannot invent in-house.\n\nAdditionally, despite perceptions, the stock has risen by around 60% over the last year, and its 29 P/E ratio makes it the most inexpensive company with a market cap above $2 trillion. That positions Alphabet to offer both safety and a higher likelihood of further gains.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nThe opportunity in Microsoft was of particular interest to Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of the Duquesne Family Office fund. He saw that Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, had returned the tech giant to prominence as a leader in cloud computing.\n\nSucceeding in the cloud today means leading in AI. Druckenmiller began buying shares at the low point of the 2022 bear market and increased the purchases as Microsoft's partnership with generative AI specialist OpenAI came to light. Now, it makes up around 11% of the Duquesne fund.\n\nThe company built on that deal, integrating search engine Bing with ChatGPT to better enable it to compete with Google Search. Additionally, it launched Copilot, an AI-powered chatbot that combines the ChatGPT large language model and Microsoft's tools to create deliverables on command through one's natural language.\n\nAmid its innovations, it holds around $80 billion in liquidity, giving it tremendous optionality. Indeed, optimism around AI has helped Microsoft stock rise by nearly 40% over the last year.\n\nAt a P/E ratio of about 39, Microsoft has become a moderately valued AI stock, but given its resources and leadership in AI, the stock should continue to rise over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Alibaba BABA is constantly making efforts to strengthen its Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) segment, which comprises Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Alibaba.com and other businesses operating in the international retail and wholesale markets.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is currently leveraging generative AI technologies to strengthen its global marketplaces, including AliExpress and Lazada.\r\n\r\nAIDC is using AI-powered tools to assist cross-border merchants with translation, content creation and product returns.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrengthening AIDC Segment Aids Prospects\n\nPer a Statista report, the global e-commerce market is anticipated to generate revenues of $4.12 trillion in 2024. The figure is expected to hit $6.48 trillion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 9.5% over 2024-2029. Strengthening the AIDC segment will enable Alibaba to capitalize on the solid growth opportunity present in the e-commerce space.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is keeping no stone unturned to make AliExpress a success. It created synergies between AliExpress and the cross-border logistics operations of Cainiao to bolster AliExpress\u2019 five-day and 10-day delivery services. BABA also increased investments in key markets to enhance customer experience, expand consumer base and strengthen AliExpress\u2019 market position globally.\r\n\r\nAliExpress also announced several promotional campaigns for shoppers after being named the exclusive global e-commerce partner of UEFA EURO 2024.\r\n\r\nThe promotional campaigns aim to enhance the user experience to drive solid customer momentum among international shoppers and sports enthusiasts for its AliExpress platform, thereby expanding its global reach.\r\n\r\nThis apart, Alibaba.com recently launched Alibaba Guaranteed for global small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\r\n\r\nAlibaba Guaranteed is a platform that simplifies B2B cross-border trade for SMEs by offering supply chain reliability. It provides secure sourcing of products at fixed prices, with guaranteed delivery within 72 hours.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned efforts will continue driving the AIDC segment\u2019s performance, which is currently the key growth driver of the company.\n\nAlibaba Suffers From Stiff Competition\n\nAlibaba faces stiff competition in the global e-commerce market from bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, as well as from its domestic competitor, JD.com JD.\r\n\r\nAmazon has been at the forefront of the e-commerce market on the back of its strong Prime momentum, robust distribution strength, expanding fulfillment network and growing relationships with third-party sellers.\r\n\r\neBay, on the other hand, is making concerted efforts to support sellers, further solidifying its position in the e-commerce space. It recently rolled out the updated \u201ceBay Advertising\u201d tool that simplifies advertising, increases listing visibility and supports stronger sales velocity, aiming to help sellers grow their sales on the platform.\r\n\r\nJD.com expanded its international express delivery service from Guangzhou and Shenzhen to nearly every district in China, boosting its popularity among SMEs. The service offers efficient logistics solutions for various products, including documents and apparel, among others, with the United States, the U.K. and Germany as top destinations.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlibaba\u2019s shares have returned 0.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 20.8%. BABA shares have also underperformed Amazon and eBay\u2019s growth of 31.5% and 22.7%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. However, JD.com\u2019s shares have lost 4.7% in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable estimate revision is also noteworthy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.20 per share, indicating a 4.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The figure has decreased by 0.7% in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nDespite the stiff competition, Alibaba\u2019s growing generative AI efforts, strong momentum across its international commerce retail and wholesale businesses, and expanding China's wholesale commerce business are expected to continue driving its top-line growth in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 total revenues stands at $138.63 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.2%.\r\n\r\nAlibaba currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "This article looks at the most advanced country in Asia in 2024. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024.\n\nA report by McKinsey in 2020 highlighted the progress made by Asia in technology and innovation over the past decade, accounting for 52% of the global growth in technology companies' revenues. The continent\u2019s share of the new unicorns established between 2012 and 2020 stood at 36%, an improvement from the decade prior when the contribution was measured at 29%.\n\nMoreover, Asia also represented 51% of the global growth in R&D expenditure during the period, led the world when it came to growth in the number of patents, and also contributed significantly toward the increase in science and engineering research articles published. Between 2016 and 2018, three-fourths of the world\u2019s STEM education graduates came from India, while in 2020, Asia went past Europe in combating climate change, emerging as the global leader in renewable technology with an installation capacity of 45%.\n\nThe advancements in technology and innovation have fueled economic growth in the region, where technology has widely been deployed across sectors, driving enhanced productivity in the corporate sphere, and boosting economic development and public service delivery at a macro level. Many Western observers have already dubbed the 21st century Asia\u2019s century, and the continent now seems to be catching up to the expectations faster than anticipated.\n\nAsia, which accounted for less than one-third of the global economy in purchasing power parity terms in 2000 is now on track to represent more than half of the world\u2019s GDP by 2040, as per a report by McKinsey. The continent is also expected to represent more than 40% of the global consumption by then. Furthermore, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, China and India are set to go past the United States as the world's first and second largest economies by 2050, with the Chinese alone forecasted to make up 20% of the global economy over the next three decades.\n\nSeveral large Western corporations including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have made inroads in the continent by outsourcing some of their key operations to Asia to tap into the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge markets, coupled with making the most of the cheap, skillful labor that is available in abundance in the region. About 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks are manufactured in China, today. The country, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, was the source of 19% of the tech giant\u2019s revenue during the fiscal year 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has recently further expanded its presence in Asia through its new stores opening in India and Malaysia.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investments in the continent have seen an uptick in Asia, with the company, in 2021, announcing the establishment of a new data center in Indonesia. The new setup is likely to increase revenues for the tech giant by $6.3 billion. On the other hand, the International Data Corporation (IDC) expects Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to add 100,000 new jobs and $39 billion to the United Arab Emirates\u2019 economy through its cloud-based services between 2022 and 2026.\n\nAsian corporations themselves contribute a whopping $19 trillion to the global economy every year. The continent is home to many of the largest corporations in the world, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a dominant player in the global foundry industry, accounting for 60% of all output. It is currently the third-best hardware stock to buy now, with 135 hedge funds bullish about the company, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database as of the first quarter of 2024. During May, the company\u2019s revenue grew 30% to a total of $7.1 billion, driven by ASML\u2019s announcement to ship its advanced high NA EUV scanner to TSM. The machine is crucial to future manufacturing technologies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has a forward P/E ratio of 26 at par with the industry average.\n\nJapanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) has a share of 11.5% of the world\u2019s automobile industry. The company sold a record 11.2 million cars worldwide in 2023, which helped Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) to retain its status as the world\u2019s top car maker for a fourth successive year. On the other hand, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) continues to remain a major force in the e-commerce market, controlling more than 50% of China\u2019s online retail industry. The Most Advanced Country in Asia in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have ranked the most advanced countries in Asia in 2024 based on three weighted metrics: technological advancement, R&D expenditure as a share of the GDP (during the latest year for which data is available), and their level of human development. The weights, in order, were 40%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. Data was sourced from WIPO\u2019s 2023 Global Innovation Index (GII), the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nIt was observed where each country ranked on a particular metric and accordingly, it was assigned a weighted score. We then summed the weighted scores for each metric to get an overall score. The 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024 are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. Since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR (NYSE:BABA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a fresh episode of \u201cMad Money\u201d on CNBC said that while investing isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s made even more difficult by \u201cauthentic Wall Street gibberish\u201d and \u201carcane technology.\u201d Cramer said that there\u2019s an \u201centire industry\u201d in Wall Street wanting people to think that investing is hard and \u201cordinary people\u201d cannot do it on their own. Cramer said that many people in the financial industry are just \u201cafter your fees\u201d and they aren\u2019t interested in making money from original investing. Cramer said that hedge fund managers and mutual funds make investing look inaccessible and impenetrable.\n\nCramer said that he\u2019s \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d and emphasized that investing isn\u2019t \u201crocket science\u201d or \u201cbrain surgery\u201d and you don\u2019t need to go to a business school to understand it. Cramer pitched himself as a \u201ccoach\u201d or a \u201ctranslator\u201d who can explain the meaning of complex financial terms to ordinary people.\n\n\u201cYou can comprehend all the mystical-sounding vocabulary we throw around here as long as you have a translator, a coach like me, who can explain what the darn words mean.\u201d\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR (NYSE:BABA) Top Stock in July?\n\nChristopher Penler / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 103\n\nJim Cramer in a recent program yet again reiterated his claim that Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR\u00a0(NYSE:BABA)\u00a0is the \u201ccheapest stock in the world.\u201d \u00a0Cramer said that David Tepper, \u201cone of the greatest investors, believes this too.\u201d\n\nCramer recommended investors to hold on to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR\u00a0(NYSE:BABA).\n\n\u201cI am not being aggressive, but you have to hold.\u201d\n\nUBS is bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) exposure to AI because of Alibaba Cloud, or Alibaba Cloud, which makes the Chinese company a formidable player in the AI enabling layer. In the intelligence layer, UBS highlighted Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) Qwen large language model, while the Qwen agent makes the company\u2019s presence notable in the application layer.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, uncertainties in China and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) lackluster performance have damaged the sentiment around the stock. While Alibaba Cloud is a significant player in the market, analysts believe enormous growth and advancements of Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft in the public Cloud markets have left Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) behind. Wall Street analysts expect Alibaba earnings to grow at a CAGR of just 1.7% only over the next five years. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) forward PEG ratio is 3.29, which is high when we incorporate the unimpressive earnings growth expectations.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) ecommerce business is also struggling as buyers in China become price-conscious amid a broader slowdown. However, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) bulls believe the stock could rebound if the situation improves in the country, given the company\u2019s massive cash flow position. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) finished fiscal 2024 with a whopping $34.37 billion in cash on hand, with another $36.42 billion in short-term investments.\n\nIn May, Baidu analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) quarterly results that the company was gaining \u201cearly momentum\u201d as it changes its priorities.\n\n\u201cAlibaba is focused on recapturing e-commerce market share in China, and capitalizing on momentum in international commerce and cloud computing building on strong growth in cross-border volumes, and accelerating revenues in public cloud,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nSebastian has an Outperform rating on the stock and an $85 price target.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares declined 7% during the quarter. There isn\u2019t much new to say about Alibaba. There was no meaningful news that drove the share price decline. The earnings for the December quarter were fine, with revenues and profits both increasing 5%\u2014not typically an exciting level of growth, but certainly enough to justify the company\u2019s paltry valuation of 4X\u20135X EBIT. As we have written in recent letters, this is a valuation level that is normally reserved for a dying business, and Alibaba is not a dying business. Management continues to implement changes that are intended to increase shareholder value. Over the past year, they have changed management, adjusted the company structure, contemplated spinning off assets, made progress monetizing the balance sheet and have improved the capital allocation. All of these actions have yet to be reflected at all in the share price. This is a stock that could double and would still be cheap.\u201d\n\nOverall, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR (NYSE:BABA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR (NYSE:BABA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding has emerged as a front runner among Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) developers, with one of its Qwen models outperforming those from domestic rivals to rank third globally behind only OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nQwen2-72B-Instruct - the most advanced version of the Hangzhou-based e-commerce giant's Qwen family of large language models (LLMs), the open source version of Tongyi Qianwen - came in just behind OpenAI's GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet in a ranking from SuperClue, a benchmarking platform that evaluates models based on metrics such as calculations, logic reasoning, coding, and text comprehension, among others.\n\nFive Chinese models - from Alibaba, start-up Deepseek, Hong Kong-listed SenseTime, smartphone vendor Oppo, and a collaborative effort between Tsinghua University and start-up Zhipu AI - outperformed GPT-4 Turbo, one of the best models from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, according to SuperClue.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe gap between Chinese and US AI models appears to be narrowing, according to SuperClue, which said China made significant progress in advancing domestic LLMs in the first half of the year.\n\nThe ranking comes just a couple of weeks after the same model topped a ranking of open-source models from the machine-learning developer platform Hugging Face, with three Qwen models making the top 10.\n\nHugging Face co-founder and CEO Clement Delangue commended the progress made by Chinese AI firms in a post on X. \"Qwen 72B is the king and Chinese open models are dominating overall,\" he wrote.\n\nAs a platform for open-source models, Hugging Face does not benchmark closed-source models, which often lead in such tests. A separate test this month by LMSYS - an AI model research organisation supported by the University of California, Berkeley - ranked Qwen2-72B 20th, with closed-source models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google taking most of the top 10 slots.\n\nOpenAI ignited an AI arms race in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, which was then based on its GPT-3.5 model. The popularity of the product sent tech giants like Google and Microsoft scrambling to put out their own chatbots.\n\nOpenAI's subsequent models have remained industry-leading, although SuperClue said most closed-source Chinese models have at this point surpassed the capabilities of GPT-3.5-Turbo.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s AI Dilemma: 3 Chinese Stocks That Could Fill the Gap",
        "content": "There was a great deal of uncertainty surrounding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its AI strategy (or lack of one) entering this year. With the first half now over, investors now have more understanding of where Apple is headed in the AI age. Indeed, the Cupertino-based innovator is shooting for intelligence (note the lack of \u201cartificial\u201d) that\u2019s not only useful and applied, but safe and private. Indeed, perhaps a slow and deliberate approach could be a strike of brilliance.\n\nFor now, Apple has chosen to partner with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence. In the future, Apple users will likely have more than one large language model (LLM) to pick from.\n\nIn China, a huge market for Apple, there won\u2019t be a ChatGPT-powered iOS 18 coming later this year. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is looking to pair up with a Chinese AI firm to bring a local LLM to the Chinese iPhone-using public. These are three powerful candidates with whom Apple may wish to strike a deal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) would be an excellent Chinese internet firm to partner to bring AI to the Chinese masses. The company\u2019s Ernie bot is comparable to ChatGPT but has one notable difference: it\u2019s trained to comply with the Cyberspace Administration of China. Undoubtedly, having an LLM that plays by the rules of Chinese regulators is paramount. If an AI model doesn\u2019t play by their rules, it could easily get shut down, and the firm behind the model could receive stiff fines.\n\nUndoubtedly, the high degree of regulatory risk makes releasing an in-house LLM so risky for Apple. The good news is that teaming up with a third party like Baidu would offshore a great deal of that risk.\n\nApart from Ernie AI\u2019s smarts, BIDU stock looks to be trading at a fat discount with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 11.8x. Even if Baidu doesn\u2019t win a deal with Apple, its latest version of Ernie (4.0 Turbo) could have the potential to be a profound success. It already has 300 million users.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo displayed on a phone screen\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Baidu, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is a Chinese tech company that\u2019s lost its way. After having shed more than 75% of its value, BABA stock looks severely undervalued deep-value for investors seeking growth from AI and e-commerce. With a P/E of 17.1, BABA is also much cheaper than comparable firms in the U.S. market.\n\nWith experience integrating AI across different products, perhaps Alibaba is a strong candidate to team up with the iPhone maker. It\u2019s not just Alibaba\u2019s LLM, Tongyi Qianwen, that\u2019s impressive, but the firm\u2019s ability to tailor AI to specific applications that may make an Alibaba-powered Apple Intelligence experience that much more delightful.\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, a deal with Apple would mean wonders for the stock. However, Alibaba needs to prove it\u2019s a cut above rivals. The company has shown it\u2019s \u201call-in\u201d on AI, with its own models, integrations, and investment in other AI startups, including Beijing\u2019s Baichuan AI. And let\u2019s not forget about Alibaba\u2019s impressive cloud expertise, which would likely be an asset in Apple\u2019s eyes.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is another internet juggernaut looking to place big bets on China\u2019s AI future. Like Alibaba, Tencent also helped fund Baichuan AI, a firm that may have the Chinese AI model to beat.\n\nTencent\u2019s intelligent network, Xingmai, may set Tencent apart from the pack when Apple finally decides. Of course, only time will tell which AI firm wins the right to be in the next generation of AI-enabled Chinese iPhones, iPads, and Vision Pros.\n\nThe main reason for owning the stock has to be the impressive video-gaming exposure. Though Tencent must play within Chinese regulators\u2019 rules, I appreciate the company\u2019s ability to engage and monetize with its intriguing mobile gaming titles.

        "title": "Alibaba (BABA) Gains 4.6% in 6 Months: What's Next for Investors?",
        "content": "Alibaba BABA, commonly known as China\u2019s e-commerce giant, has seen its stock price climb 4.6% in the past six months, underperforming the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry and Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s growth of 21.3% and 12.7%, respectively. \r\n\r\nMacroeconomic headwinds, sluggish growth in China and various market challenges in different countries have been hitting the stock hard. BABA has lost 2.3% in the year-to-date period and is currently trading below the 50-day moving average.\r\n\r\nAlthough Alibaba is the dominant e-commerce player in China, its global position remains under threat from bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY.\n\nBABA Trades Below 50-Day Average Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNevertheless, the modest short-term gain in the stock reflects Alibaba\u2019s resiliency amid the challenging macroeconomic environment. An expanding international commerce business, along with growing traction in its domestic e-commerce business, is primarily benefiting the stock. Strategic investments and a deepening focus on the innovation of products and services with the power of AI are playing a vital role in shaping the growth trajectory of the company.\n\nSix-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowing Momentum in Taobao & Tmall Drives Growth\n\nImprovement in Taobao and Tmall Group, on the back of its three key investment areas \u2014 product supply, competitive pricing and quality service, remains a major positive for Alibaba\u2019s domestic e-commerce business.\r\n\r\nThe solid execution of the user-first strategy by creating a system for brands, distributors and industrial belt factories is benefiting the company\u2019s core business.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is witnessing positive consumer feedback on the back of increasing investments in driving price competitiveness and elevating the user experience. This is evident from double-digit online GMV and order growth on a year-over-year basis in fourth-quarter fiscal 2024. The company experienced a substantial increase in the number of purchasers and purchase frequency in the quarter.\r\n\r\nBABA is gearing up to introduce monetization mechanisms, which will align with\r\nnew platform algorithms and product features in the second half of this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nWith these strategic investments, which are aimed at improving the overall shopping experience, Alibaba expects Taobao and Tmall Group\u2019s GMV to gradually return to healthy growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nInternational Commerce Strength Boosts Long-Term Prospects\n\nSolid momentum in AliExpress, Trendyol and Alibaba.com has been benefiting the overseas e-commerce business significantly. Growing investments in key markets are helping improve the brand recognition of AliExpress and Trendyol.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba\u2019s expanding cross-border retail and logistics operations are major positives.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStrength in AE Choice is driving growth within the business. Its initiative of upgrading the supply-chain service has resulted in the transition from the original platform business model to a supply-chain-driven platform marketplace model, which offers semi-consignment and full-consignment services.\r\n\r\nAlibaba\u2019s deepening focus on delivering localized and enhanced user experiences to different consumers worldwide remains noteworthy. The company is leveraging AI and other advanced technologies to improve efficiency in areas such as cross-platform product listing, product details, multilingual search, and targeted recommendations.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is witnessing an increase in the number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) utilizing AI services on its platform. Around 17,000 SMEs have subscribed to the AI Business Assistant launched on Alibaba.com and millions of products have now been launched with AI.\r\n\r\nAlso, searches for AI-optimized products have increased 37%.\r\n\r\nThe recent introduction of Alibaba Guaranteed for global SMEs is another plus. Alibaba Guaranteed is a platform that simplifies B2B cross-border trade for SMEs by offering supply-chain reliability.\r\n\r\nThe launch of an affordable logistics solution, namely Logistics Marketplace, for SMEs in the United States remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGiven these factors and initiatives, there remains a huge upward potential in the Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (\u201cAIDC\u201d) business, which has turned out to be the key catalyst for Alibaba.\n\nSolid Liquidity Supports BABA\u2019s Shareholder-Friendly Initiative\n\nAlibaba\u2019s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Mar 31, 2024, the company had a strong net cash position of RMB 446.5 billion or $61.8 billion. The free cash flow was RMB 15.4 billion. Solid cash flow generation allows Alibaba to return in the combination of share repurchase and dividend payments to its shareholders.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the quarter ended Mar 31, 2024, it repurchased 524 million ordinary shares (the equivalent of 65 million ADSs) for $4.8 billion in the United States and Hong Kong markets under its share repurchase program.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s board of directors has further approved an annual cash dividend of $1 per ADS for this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the near-term prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remain foggy due to softness in China and macroeconomic challenges, including high interest rates and inflationary pressure, its long-term prospects are expected to benefit from strength in AIDC business, solid momentum in Taobao and Tmall, investments in price competitiveness, growing traction among SMEs and AI-driven product strategies. Its leading position in China\u2019s e-commerce market also remains promising.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $138.63 billion, indicating 6.2% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has been unchanged at $8.20 per share over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Alibaba is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 8.93X compared with the industry\u2019s 26.46X, which reflects a strong entry point for investors.

        "content": "The basketball legend-turned-entrepreneur will front\u00a0Alibaba.com's campaign\u2014\"Same Player, New Game\"\u2014for the Olympic Games Paris 2024 alongside two other sporting stars who are also winning in business\n\nPARIS, July 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Alibaba.com, a leading platform for global business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, today announced Tony Parker as a Global Ambassador for its \"Same Player, New Game\" creative campaign for the Olympic Games Paris 2024. Alibaba.com is the Official E-Commerce Services Partner of the Olympic Games Paris 2024. Tony Parker ENG\n\nAs the world's only truly global, multi-sport athletics competition, the Olympic Games brings together over 200 countries in more than 300 events. Just as the Olympic Games reaches a global audience, Alibaba.com\u2014which connects B2B buyers and suppliers from over 200 countries and regions and offers services and business tools to enable businesses to discover products, find suppliers and place orders quickly\u2014serves as a hub for ambitious individuals to go for gold in the world of commerce.\n\nAlibaba.com's Global Ambassador, Tony Parker, is a two-time Olympian who reached the quarterfinals of Men's Basketball with France at the Olympic Games Rio 2016. Regarded as a legend of his sport, Tony is a four-time winner of the NBA and has been featured in the NBA All-Star team six times. However, Tony's successful career goes beyond his sporting accomplishments. Since retiring from the game, he has become a serial entrepreneur and investor who has successfully bridged the divide between sports and business.\n\nReflecting this sentiment, the \"Same Player, New Game\" campaign will raise awareness of the opportunities for athletes and Olympians to transition from sporting success to entrepreneurship. As a Global Ambassador, Tony will highlight the ease at which aspiring entrepreneurs\u2014including athletes and former athletes\u2014can set up their own businesses, establish supply chains with buyers and sellers from around the globe, and drive long-term growth through Alibaba.com.\n\nIn the campaign, Tony will be joined by Simona Galik Moore, a former Women's Tennis Association professional, and Elias Schw\u00e4rzler, the adrenaline-chasing mountain biker who\u2014since 2022\u2014has held the Guinness World Record for \"Fastest Bicycle Towed by a Motorcycle.\" Like Tony, both athletes have gone on to achieve success outside of sports. In 2020, Simona launched a professional pickleball brand driving interest in one of the most exciting new sports. Meanwhile, Elias is the founder and owner of a specialist mountain biking clothing brand and mountain biking academy. Both use Alibaba.com as an integral part of their businesses to source new products, forge new partnerships, and support growth. Each will also share more details of their journey from sporting stars to entrepreneurs in the run-up to the Games, including at a high-profile press event scheduled to take place on July 31 in Paris.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the coming weeks, fans can also expect to see Alibaba.com's Global Ambassadors featured in the run-up to and during the Olympic Games Paris 2024. Launching this month, the three Global Ambassadors will star in a new brand campaign[1] highlighting Alibaba.com's innovative approach to business.\n\nLiz Wang, Global Head of Marketing, Alibaba.com, said:\u00a0\"To reach the pinnacle of your sport, you need to be self-motivated, disciplined, resilient and competitive\u2014all traits that are also needed to be a successful entrepreneur. Tony Parker, Simona Galik Moore and Elias Schw\u00e4rzler are inspiring examples of the transition from sports to business, and we are thrilled to welcome them to the Alibaba.com team during the Olympic Games Paris 2024.\n\n\"This is a fantastic opportunity to put a spotlight on the business opportunities available to former professional sportspeople, and how platforms such as Alibaba.com can help turn their entrepreneurial ambitions into reality.\"\n\nTony Parkersaid: \"Since retiring from professional sport, I've focused all my energy on running my own businesses. I'm a regular buyer on\u00a0Alibaba.com and have seen first-hand the huge value that can be created by connecting with suppliers and efficiently sourcing products through its innovative digital platform. Now, in my role as an ambassador for Alibaba.com, I will use my personal experience to help other athletes embark upon their entrepreneurial journeys and enjoy a successful second career.\"\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nAlibaba.com is a Worldwide Olympic Partner of the Olympic Games for e-commerce platform services.

        "title": "The Country with the Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World in 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 20 Countries with the Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World in 2024 and in this article we will look at the country that topped our list.\n\nRegional GDP Comparisons: The Role of GDP (PPP) in Economic Forecasting\n\nPurchasing Power Parity is the rate at which the currency of one country would have to be converted into that of another country to buy the same amount of goods and services in each country. For example, a haircut in New York is more expensive than in Delhi, a taxi ride costs more in Paris than in China, and a cricket game ticket is pricier in London than in Lahore. This price disparity is due to lower wages in underdeveloped countries, making services, which are labor-intensive, less expensive. Ignoring these price differences underestimates the purchasing power of consumers in emerging and developing countries. Therefore, PPP is generally considered a better measure of overall comparison.\n\nWhen international financial institutions produce regional and global statistics using aggregate data from numerous countries it is converted from its national currency to a common currency, typically the US dollar. There are two main methods for this conversion: market exchange rates and purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Market exchange rates are the rates prevailing in the foreign exchange market, whereas PPP exchange rates reflect the rate at which one country's currency would need to be converted to another's to purchase the same amount of goods and services in each country.\n\nGDP at PPP utilizes PPP exchange rates to convert a country's nominal GDP into a common currency, allowing for more accurate comparisons of economic output and living standards across nations. Adjusting GDP figures for differences in price levels and purchasing power provides a more accurate representation of the real value of goods and services produced, reflecting actual living standards and economic well-being. It accounts for the lower cost of non-traded goods and services in low-income countries offers more stability over time compared to market exchange rates and helps forecast economic comparisons more efficiently. Whereas, market-based rates only reflect internationally traded goods, ignoring the fact that non-traded goods and services are often cheaper in low-income countries compared to high-income ones.\n\nInternational organizations rely on GDP at PPP for global and regional economic analysis, forecasting, and policy recommendations. Despite its advantages, calculating PPP is complex and can be subject to measurement challenges, potentially affecting the accuracy of GDP at PPP figures. However, GDP (PPP) creates a more equitable basis for comparing economies with different currencies and price levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Asia and Pacific region has the highest GDP (PPP) with $85.49 trillion. This is followed by East Asia at $47.49 trillion, the Western Hemisphere at $44.76 trillion, Europe at $38.3 trillion, and North America at $34.82 trillion.\n\nMajor Company Shaping the Global Economy\n\nThe companies that contribute the most to the global economy based on purchasing power parity (PPP) include leading corporations such as Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). The company has a significant economic influence due to its extensive operations, market reach, economic activity, and growth.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a multinational conglomerate specializing in e-commerce, payment processing, logistics, retail, internet, and technology services. In addition to its core business areas, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has a presence in digital media, entertainment, and cloud computing and offers streaming services and online video and music streaming platforms. The company operates China's largest wholesale marketplace and offers products in over 40 categories to buyers in more than 190 countries. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is also actively involved in artificial intelligence research and development.\n\nOn May 14, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported that its revenue for the three months ending on March 31, increased 8% year-on-year to $33.26 billion. The company beat its revenue estimate by $256.74 million. Taobao and Tmall Group reported the highest revenue which increased by 4% to $12.81 billion. Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group reported the highest growth with revenue reaching $3.77 billion with a 45% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. During the quarter Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) repurchased a total of 524 million ordinary shares in the United States and Hong Kong markets for a total of $4.8 billion. Analysts predict that for the quarter ending on June 30, Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) revenue is expected to reach $33.95 billion.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is focusing on its AI technology and continuously improving user experience and efficiency in areas such as cross-platform product listing, optimization of product details, targeted recommendations, and multilingual search. An increasing number of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the platform are to leveraging AI services and over 17,000 SMEs have already subscribed to the AI Business Assistant launched on Alibaba.com due to this, searches for AI-optimized products have increased by 37%. On May 24, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) announced plans to establish new availability zones and significantly increase global investment to promote AI innovation and development. During a recent global summit held in Paris, the company revealed its plan to set up its first cloud region in Mexico and expand data centers in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and South Korea over the next three years. By increasing investment in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure across major international markets, Alibaba Cloud aims to offer a broader array of cloud computing and AI products to customers all around the world.\n\nPurchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a crucial tool for making accurate and equitable economic comparisons across countries with different currencies and price levels. By considering the varying costs of goods and services, GDP at PPP offers a more realistic view of economic output and living standards, particularly in low-income and emerging markets. With that in context let's look at the 20 countries with the highest purchasing power parity in the world in 2024.

        "content": "SINGAPORE - Chinese tech giant Alibaba's international e-commerce unit is tapping generative AI-powered tools to help cross-border merchants with translation, content creation and product returns, group vice president Kaifu Zhang said.\n\nSpeaking on stage at the Reuters Next Conference in Singapore, the executive, who heads Alibaba International Digital Commerce's artificial intelligence (AI) initiative, said he was bullish on AI's potential for the company, even in the face of increasing tensions between China and the U.S.\n\n\"China is pretty much on par with the U.S in the rate of (AI) innovation,\" said Zhang, who highlighted the global developments made in China and Europe in open-source AI technology.\n\nThe sprawling tech conglomerate has been grappling with how to make its global marketplaces, including AliExpress and Lazada, more competitive after restructuring its international e-commerce unit into a standalone business.\n\nThe advantages of an early head-start have faded in recent years, with sales and growth outshone by China-founded peers Shein and NASDAQ-listed PDD's Temu.\n\nAccording to Zhang, Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group now has 300 million consumers yearly and over one million merchants around the world.\n\nThe unit has become one of Alibaba's brightest growth areas.

        "content": "Investors looking for opportunities will always be interested in high-potential stocks capable of turning $5K into $50K. Realistically speaking, securing 10x returns is not particularly easy. The most obvious route to do so is through penny stocks. However, penny stocks often produce losses and are too unstable for the majority of investors.\n\nA smarter, safer route is to identify currently strong companies with the potential for rapid fundamental improvements over several years. Stock picks within this grouping are smart choices for investors looking to turn a relatively modest stake of $5,000 into $50,000.\n\nTime will tell whether the stocks discussed below truly yield 10x returns. Investing in these stocks will lead to returns that outperform the market. In other words, these stocks are not simply moonshot rolls of the dice for investors seeking strong returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltimmune (ALT) Light blue pills on white background. Pharmaceutical industry, medical treatment, presciption drugs concept. Digital 3D render., biotech stocks, big pharma. EVAX stock\n\nSource: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltimmune (NASDAQ:ALT) is a stock to absolutely watch out for following the success of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) for their weight loss drugs.\n\nThe success of those companies in commercializing weight loss drugs has increased their respective share prices by more than 90% and 70% over the past year. As a result of that success, each firm has the potential to become a $1 trillion enterprise.\n\nThat has investors wondering who the next competitor to their presumed throne is.\n\nEnter Altimmune.\n\nThe firm\u2019s weight loss treatment, Pemviditude, is a legitimate threat for an important reason: It produces similar levels of weight loss while preserving lean muscle mass at rates better than the competition.\n\nWegovy has been associated with a 40% decline in muscle mass as a percentage of weight loss.\u00a0Pemviditude, on the other hand, is associated with a 21.9% decrease in muscle mass as a percentage of weight loss. Thus, old immune has a legitimate chance to grow very quickly and for investors seeking to replicate recent growth at Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk it may be the best choice.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Electric car backlit by cyan blue neon light next to EV charger with cyan blue light and lightning bolt symbol, all against a black background. ev stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/JLStock\n\nShares of Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) have risen and fallen on the potential surrounding electric vehicles. Current forecasts suggest Albemarle stock will rise again. The question is more about how much rather than if.\n\nThe forecast suggests that today\u2019s investment should yield 50% returns in the next 12 to 18 months. Those expectations are strongly predicated upon the return of lithium sales as electric vehicle sales surge again.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop-line revenues are expected to return to 2022 levels in 2025. Earnings are also expected to triple in 2025 relative to this year. Projected metrics such as those make it very easy to understand why Albemarle shares could even triple during that period.\n\nYes, Albemarle is hanging on while also being fundamentally stable. It\u2019s a strong, high-potential pick for any contrarian who believes the bearish arguments surrounding electric vehicles have been overdone.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will probably raise a few eyebrows as a stock with 10x potential. After all, it\u2019s currently valued at more than $3 trillion. Only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are more valuable by that metric.\n\nHowever, investors must look at the company\u2019s potential over the next few years. In doing so, they will understand just how valuable Nvidia\u2019s opportunity is. The point is simple: Nvidia\u2019s growth isn\u2019t expected to slow down anytime soon. It is expected to grow its revenues by over 100% in 2024. Revenues are expected to double again from there by 2027.\n\nBy 2028, the forecasted market value of artificial intelligence is expected to rise to $460 billion.\u00a0 Nvidia is expected to produce $250 billion in sales during that year. One could reasonably argue that Nvidia is more than half of the entire AI market and will be so for the foreseeable future. Some analysts forecast that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion by 2030. Growth in share price doesn\u2019t have to be linear, so the transition from $3 trillion to $10 trillion may produce 10X returns.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Close up of Cloudflare logo at the Company's headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most convincing arguments in favor of the notion that Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) stock can turn $5K into $50K is pure fundamentals.\n\nThe emerging cloud security giant is expected to produce net earnings in 2024 for the first time in its history. Earnings are expected to roughly double by 2026 and then double again by 2028. Earnings are among the best predictors of sustainable growth in a given stock. Cloudflare is moving into that opportunity as you read this. Sales are expected to grow by approximately 30% annually in the upcoming five years.\n\nMeanwhile, Cloudflare boasts phenomenally strong gross profits. The company\u2019s high gross profit levels indicate strong pricing power and an overall strong position relative to its competition.\n\nCloudflare also benefits from increasing demand for cloud security, especially as artificial intelligence grows. Overall, the company and stock are well-positioned for the current era.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) An image of a cellphone surrounded by money and shopping bags, a calendar and shopping cart on the screen; schedule payment\n\nSource: ArtemisDiana/Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a relatively unknown fintech stock worth understanding by investors seeking 10x plays. The company specializes in buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, and its shares increased in value by 330% in 2024 alone.\n\nWhile sales increased by an impressive 35.5% during the first quarter, income growth prompted the strong growth in Sezzle stock. Net income grew by more than 364% in the first quarter, eclipsing $8 million.\n\nThose strong results prompted the company to be very bullish regarding guidance. The company upped its GAAP net income guidance from $20 million in 2024 to $30 million for the year. The company also updated revenue growth expectations from 20% to 25% over the same period.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to ignore any company that increases its earnings guidance by 50% in a year. That alone is a reason to consider investing in Sezzle at the moment.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is one of, if not the most popular, language learning apps. The company has successfully gamified language learning and is reaping the benefits. Those benefits are showing up in the company\u2019s financial statements, which are impressive.\n\nQ1 revenues increased by 45%. That growth is impressive in itself, but it\u2019s earnings that investors should consider. Net income reached $27 million during that period, a significant increase over the $2 company\u2019s .6 million net loss a year earlier.\n\nOverall earnings are expected to increase by 366% in 2024. Meanwhile, Duolingo is firmly amid hypergrowth presently. While Duolingo is not cheap relative to the majority of its competitors in the software industry, it\u2019s also nowhere near record high prices. Users continue to flock to the platform, resulting in rapidly improving and strong fundamentals overall for the firm. Investing in Duolingo has inherent volatility, but it still has the potential to be 10X your money.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Smartphone displaying orange Temu logo in a miniature shopping cart against a yellow background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/yanishevska\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of the best growth stories in the Chinese economy, and it has seen its share of troubles lately. PDD stock is the parent of Temu, the fast growing e-commerce retailer Rapidly growing market share at home and abroad.\n\nRevenues grew by 131% during the first quarter for the firm. Those impressive growth rates are one of the primary reasons PDD stock boasts a market cap higher than that of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).\n\nAnalysts expect Temu to continue growing rapidly. They are particularly bullish on PDD because Temu recently introduced the consignment model. That model pushes logistics costs onto merchants, theoretically Improving profitability faster than previously expected. Net income and transactional revenues are both surging at PDD Holdings. Meanwhile, analysts believe that Much of the risk in China has dissipated. Combining all those factors suggests that PDD shares can continue to Surge and potentially turn $1 of investment into $10 over the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) has surged by more than 8% in the past six months, suggesting that investors have gained renewed optimism about Chinese stocks. Despite having my reservations, I share investors\u2019 current sentiment as I believe China\u2019s leading emerging market status provides it with an edge, meaning systematic support is likely.\n\nAlthough highly lucrative at times, Chinese stocks can face severe drawdowns due to opaque government policies, unconsolidated industries and fierce sectoral competition. As such, I decided to embark on a journey to find three undervalued Chinese stocks with asymmetrical upside potential. Methodologically, my screening process emphasized fundamental aspects, valuation metrics and technical analysis. Moreover, I assessed the prevailing market sentiment to ensure alignment.\n\nIf you\u2019re as bullish about Chinese stocks as I am, then here are three worth considering.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Zombies and Bears Beware, Alibaba Stock Will Still Defeat You!\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) stock looks like a classic \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity, whereby a divergence between the company\u2019s fundamentals and stock performance has occurred.\n\nBABA stock has shed about 10% of its market value in the past twelve months. Nevertheless, Alibaba\u2019s operating performance remained robust. For example, it recently surpassed its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by $256.74 million, proving its secular value proposition.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s segmental growth remains intact. As communicated by its fourth-quarter results, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce segment grew by an additional 45.1% year-over-year (YoY), while its logistics segment advanced by 29.8%. The aforementioned segments comprise a hefty part of Alibaba\u2019s revenue mix, providing a reasonable basis to conclude that Alibaba\u2019s growth story remains intact.\n\nIt must be known that BABA stock isn\u2019t a risk-free asset. The company faces numerous challenges, such as trade disputes between the Eastern and Western parts of the world. Additionally, Alibaba\u2019s operating profit margin of 8.5% seems quite narrow. Nevertheless, given the above-mentioned factors, I think BABA stock presents a buying opportunity, especially as it currently possesses a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of merely 8.91x!\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Man holding a mobile with PinDuoDuo (PDD) logo at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou\u2019ve come to the right place if you\u2019re looking for a diversified e-commerce player with proven results. PDD Holdings\u2019 (NASDAQ:PDD) e-commerce portfolio functions in critical end markets, including agriculture, food and beverages, household appliances and apparel, to name a few. Although debatable, I believe the firm\u2019s broad end-market exposure presents an abundance of synergies, allowing for sustainable top-line growth and cost structure improvements.\n\nStory continues\n\nPDD Holdings is a firm favorite at Goldman Sachs. The bank recently upgraded the stock to Buy from its previous Hold rating based on PDD Holdings\u2019 resilient revenue growth and comprehensive unit economics. I agree with Goldman\u2019s stance. In fact, the company\u2019s unitary efficiency is echoed by PDD stock\u2019s return on common equity (ROE) ratio of 46.3%.\n\nFurthermore, PDD Stock\u2019s capital markets-based prospects look in good shape. For instance, PDD stock has a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of only 0.52x, suggesting it is a growth-at-a-reasonable price (GARP) opportunity. Additionally, PDD stock\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is hovering in the low 40s, adding substance to a bullish argument from a technical vantage point.\n\nTAL Education Group (TAL) GNS stock: a child in front of a laptop taking notes while viewing an online class\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) is one of the pioneers of online education in China. The company was founded in the early 2000s, but it only sprung to life recently amid a boom in technological uptake among primary and secondary school learners.\n\nEven though it has embedded risks, key indicators suggest that TAL stock is an excellent buy after declining by approximately 15% in the past six months. For example, the company recently delivered a telling fourth-quarter earnings report that communicated $429.6 million in revenue, a 59.7% year-over-year increase. Moreover, TAL maintains a strong cash position of around $3.3 billion, allowing it to scale its capacity in the following years.\n\nLastly, TAL stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 4.4x, which I deem low, given the company\u2019s illustrious growth and its exposure to an industry set to expand at an annualized rate of 15.65% until 2028.\n\nAfter considering its salient features, I conclude that I am bullish about TAL stock\u2019s prospects!\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit on Monday launched a new advertising campaign in China featuring top executives from start-up Moonshot AI and online recruitment platform Zhilian Zhaopin, amid fierce competition in the local market.\n\nThe ads - currently displayed at airports in Beijing and Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province - promoted the market leader's capability of supporting artificial intelligence (AI) development at well-known Chinese companies with the slogan, \"Alibaba Cloud is the cloud I use\".\n\nIn one ad, Yang Zhilin - founder of Moonshot AI, one of the country's top start-ups dubbed the \"new AI tigers\" - praised Alibaba Cloud's \"robust computing power\" and large-model service platform for enhancing the efficiency of its Kimi model.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAlibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, is a major backer of Moonshot AI, having spent around US$800 million to acquire a 36 per cent equity interest in the start-up. Kimi Chatbot, launched last October and powered by Moonshot AI's self-developed model, is seen as one of China's most promising answers to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnother ad showed Zhang Yuejia, group president at Zhilian Zhaopin, crediting Alibaba Cloud for helping the firm quickly adopt large AI models in human resources applications.\n\nChina's cloud giants have been engaged in an intensifying competition since last year, as rivals slashed prices to lure clients ranging from big names to small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nWhile Alibaba Cloud at the end of 2023 maintained its leading position in the domestic market with a 39 per cent share, growth slowed to 3 per cent compared with Huawei Cloud's 23 per cent and Tencent Cloud's 27 per cent, according to researcher Canalys.\n\nIn the March quarter this year, sales from Alibaba Cloud rose 3 per cent year on year to 25.6 billion yuan (US$3.5 billion).\n\nAlibaba Cloud and others are gunning for a market that is expected to expand faster this year, thanks partly to the popularity of generative AI, said Canalys.\n\nData centres run by Alibaba.

        "content": "Chinese large language model (LLM) developers from SenseTime and Alibaba Group Holding have rushed to declare fresh progress in developing their artificial intelligence (AI) technology at the country's largest annual industry conference, in sign of deepening competition in the country's largely closed-off market.\n\nAt the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, Chinese AI champion SenseTime on Friday released a series of updated versions of its SenseNova LLMs, including SenseNova 5.5, its latest foundational model, which the company claims has 30 per cent improved performance compared with the previous version released in April.\n\n\"I believe the key to success and differentiation in China's road to AI is how to construct high-level thinking logic based on synthetic data in vertical industries,\" SenseTime co-founder and CEO Xu Li said at the conference.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nXu claimed that SenseNova 5.5 has surpassed GPT-4o in five of eight key metrics, citing data from OpenCompass, a platform for benchmarking large models. At the same time, its stock price plunged 16 per cent in Hong Kong on Friday.\n\nSenseTime is among a number of Chinese Big Tech companies that have sought to use WAIC as an opportunity to boast about progress made in developing LLMs amid heightened competition in the domestic market.\n\nAlibaba's cloud computing unit, the developer of the Tongyi Qianwen LLMs, also touted new user growth. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nIn the past two months, downloads of the open-source Tongyi Qianwen models doubled to more than 20 million.\n\nThe number of customers served by Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, the company's generative AI development platform designed for corporate customers and partners, also increased by over 150 per cent to 230,000, according to Zhou Jingren, Alibaba Cloud's chief technology officer.\n\nZhou asserted Alibaba Cloud's commitment to open-source initiatives.\n\n\"Two years ago, we released the Tongyi model series at WAIC. At that time, we announced that Tongyi's core model would be open source,\" he said.\n\n\"Today, Tongyi Qianwen has achieved full-scale and full-modal open source in the true sense, narrowing the gap between open-source and closed-source models.\"\n\nYan Junjie, founder and CEO of Shanghai-based AI start-up MiniMax, made a bold prediction in an interview with local outlet Sina.com that despite red-hot competition in the global LLM market - China alone has more than 200 such models available - only five companies will be making these models in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"How many of these will be in China, that's a question I don't know [the answer to],\" Yan said.\n\nMiniMax is one of China's so-called AI Tigers, alongside Zhipu AI, Baichuan, and Moonshot AI - all based in Beijing.\n\nThe group's unofficial name represents a belief that they are China's best hope in rivalling overseas start-ups like Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Anthropic, the Amazon.com-backed developer of Claude.\n\nIn his speech at WAIC, Yan said that there is an imperative for AI models to improve their accuracy before playing a bigger role in traditional industries.\n\nSenseTime also launched at the Shanghai event its 5o and 5.5 Lite models. SenseNova 5o is a multimodal model, while 5.5 Lite is a terminal-based model.\n\nXu said SenseNova 5o is the first large AI model in China to realise a new means of human-AI interaction by integrating cross-modal information such as sound, text, images and video in real time.\n\nIn a live demonstration, a SenseTime staff member took a video of himself standing on stage and showed how the model was able to immediately identify that he is attending the WAIC conference using a badge worn on top of his T-shirt.\n\nIt was also able to answer follow-up questions, explaining what the conference is for.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Alibaba Stock (NYSE:BABA): Bullish on Accelerating Growth, Growing Capital Returns",
        "content": "Alibaba stock (NYSE:BABA) remains depressed, showing no signs of a meaningful recovery. Despite major indices climbing to new highs over the past year, investors remain largely uninterested in the Chinese e-commerce giant\u2019s investment case. However, with Alibaba\u2019s growth showing signs of acceleration, as well as management becoming increasingly focused on returning capital to shareholders, particularly through buybacks, the stock could attract the bulls back. Consequently, I have now turned bullish on BABA stock.\n\nGrowth Picks Up, Sets the Stage for Robust FY2025\n\nAlibaba\u2019s most recent results marked a return to growth and set the stage for a robust FY2025. For its Q4-2024, ending March 31st, Alibaba posted revenues of $30.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. This pushed the company\u2019s full-year revenues to $130.4 billion, up 8% compared to FY2023. Notably, this marked a return to growth, as, in the prior year, revenues had grown by just 2%, coming in essentially flat.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s growth was driven by robust traction across the board. The core e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, saw single-digit growth in revenue, increasing by 4% year-over-year. This growth was driven by an increase in the number of buyers and purchase frequency. Evidently, gross merchandise value (GMV) across both platforms achieved double-digit growth, driven by rapid order growth, improvements in user experience, and price competitiveness.\u200b\n\nInternationally, Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) posted an even more remarkable revenue increase of 45%. Management noted solid combined order growth, revenue contributions from AliExpress\u2019 Choice, and improvements in monetization that strengthened Alibaba\u2019s position outside of China.\n\nFinally, while Cloud Intelligence revenues grew by a more underwhelming 3% compared to last year, the company still made significant developments that could accelerate this segment\u2019s growth in the short-to-medium term. Specifically, Alibaba posted double-digit revenue growth in its core public cloud offerings and triple-digit growth in its AI-related revenues.\n\nAlthough Alibaba did not disclose its AI-related revenues, this suggests the company is poised to become a dominant player in the AI sector within China. While Western corporations are unlikely to engage with Chinese AI technologies, and vice versa, this creates a significant competitive advantage for Alibaba. Few, if any, companies have the same scale in cloud computing to compete with Alibaba domestically, hence my argument.\n\nProfitability, Valuation, and Capital Returns\n\nAlibaba\u2019s return to growth in FY2024 led to even more impressive improvements in profitability, largely thanks to the company\u2019s incredible economies of scale. The company achieved adjusted EBITA growth of 12% to $22.9 billion, with its adjusted EBITA margin expanding from 17% to 18%. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s adjusted net income also rose by 11% to $21.8 billion, while on a per-American Depositary Share (ADS) basis, this figure rose by an even more significant 14% to $8.62, aided by a lower ADS count due to Alibaba\u2019s buybacks.\n\nStory continues Source: Alibaba\u2019s Q4-2024 and full-year report\n\nWall Street expects Alibaba\u2019s ADS to moderate this year, with consensus estimates projecting $8.20 for FY2025, indicating a slight decline of 4.7%. Despite this, Alibaba\u2019s stock still trades at an exceptionally low forward P/E ratio of 9x. Sure, the risks associated with Alibaba are well-known and should not be ignored. Yet, at this multiple, it\u2019s hard to keep dismissing the stock\u2019s investment case, given its moat in the market.\n\nThis is particularly true when considering Alibaba\u2019s rising capital returns. Management has made it clear that they are aware of the stock\u2019s undervaluation and have focused on return capital to reward existing shareholders and attract new ones by bolstering confidence in the stock. The company has repurchased and retired nearly 11% of its shares since early 2022, while this year\u2019s regular and special dividends ($1.66 per ADS in total) make for an additional yield of 2.2% at the stock\u2019s current price levels.\n\nWith plenty of room for Alibaba to keep growing its capital returns, the combined yield from repurchases and dividends is poised to become increasingly attractive if the stock price remains at current levels. Given that the stock\u2019s total yield is already in the high single digits, I believe this element represents the strongest bullish catalyst. Real, tangible capital returns are a powerful driver that\u2019s difficult to overlook.\n\nIs BABA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nMost Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Alibaba, which isn\u2019t surprising, given its depressed valuation. The stock maintains a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys and three Holds. At $103.70, the average BABA stock price target has recently widened from the current stock price, implying substantial upside potential of 39.2%.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nAlibaba\u2019s stock has consistently underperformed over the years, including during the recent uptrend of the broader market. That said, recent developments suggest a potential U-turn. With a return to growth in FY2024 and promising indicators for FY2025, Alibaba\u2019s investment case seems increasingly promising. Blended with a recent focus on capital returns, including substantial share buybacks and a growing dividend, Alibaba may be in a position to start attracting the bulls back.\n\nRegardless, at its current valuation, the potential rewards appear to outweigh the risks, even considering the inherent risks associated with a company like Alibaba.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "5 Historically Cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024 (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "For roughly 30 years, Wall Street and the investing community have been waiting for the next great innovation to come along that can rival what the advent of the internet did for corporate America. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) just might be this long-awaited technology.\n\nWith AI, software and systems are used in place of humans to oversee and/or undertake tasks. The true value of AI lies in the ability of these systems to learn over time without human intervention. This allows AI-driven software and systems to become more effective at tasks and perhaps even learn new jobs over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence represents an estimated $15.7 trillion opportunity by 2030\n\nAlthough estimates are all over the map, as you'd expect from a still relatively unknown technology, the analysts at PwC released a report last year in which they estimate AI can add up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\n\nWith an addressable market this large, a lot of companies can come out as winners. But that doesn't mean you can throw a dart at a written list of AI stocks and automatically make money.\n\nFor the moment, no company is more directly benefiting from the AI revolution than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock has gained up to $3 trillion in market value, with the company's board recently approving a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nNvidia's otherworldly gains and textbook operational scaling are the result of its AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the standard in high-compute data centers. With demand for these chips absolutely overwhelming their supply, Nvidia has been able to meaningfully increase its prices and reap the rewards.\n\nUnfortunately, every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years, including the internet, underwent an early-stage bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors consistently overestimate the adoption and/or utility of new technologies, innovations, or trends. AI will need time to mature, just like every next-big-thing innovation before it, and that bodes poorly for Nvidia's stock.\n\nBut not all artificial intelligence stocks would be in trouble if the AI bubble burst. Thanks to their foundational operating segments, the following five historically cheap AI stocks can be confidently bought for the second half of 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first cheap AI stock that you can gobble up with confidence for the latter half of the current year (and likely hold well beyond 2024) is social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe beauty of Meta's operating model is that it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising. Even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in AI data centers, the metaverse, and various augmented/virtual reality devices, Meta's prime social media \"real estate,\" coupled with lengthy periods of expansion for the U.S. and global economy, are what power its operating cash flow and profits at the end of the day.\n\nAs of the end of March, Meta was luring 3.24 billion users to its social media platforms each day. Advertisers are well aware that there's no better alternative to reach users than to advertise with Meta.\n\nEven after more than quintupling from its 2022 bear market low, shares of Meta can be purchased right now for less than 14 times estimated cash flow for 2025. For context, this is a 6% discount to its average forward-year cash flow multiple over the last five years and represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in every year over the last decade, save for 2022. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlibaba\n\nThe next exceptionally inexpensive artificial intelligence stock you can buy without fear in the second half of 2024 is China-based e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nAccording to the International Trade Administration, Alibaba is China's top dog in online retail sales, with Taobao and Tmall accounting for an estimated 50.8% share of China's e-commerce sales. Even with China's economy stuck in neutral following the COVID-19 pandemic, an eventual strengthening of the country's burgeoning middle class should lift the long-term prospects for this segment.\n\nFurther, Alibaba Cloud is China's leading cloud infrastructure service platform by revenue. Alibaba Cloud is where generative AI solutions can be offered to customers to support and enhance their businesses. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its very early stages of ramping up.\n\nShares of Alibaba are currently valued at less than 8 times forward-year earnings, which is a steal when you account for its $85.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments as of March 31. INTC Price to Book Value Chart\n\nIntel\n\nA third AI stock that can shine in the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is semiconductor stalwart Intel(NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nThere's no question that Nvidia has left Intel in the dust over the last 18 months. But in the second half of this year, Intel is releasing its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad scale. With Nvidia unable to meet the demand of all its customers, Intel and its rivals should be able to easily grab share.\n\nBut there's more to like about Intel than just its AI ties. Its legacy central processing unit (CPU) operations for personal computers and traditional data centers remain a cash cow for the company. This cash is being reinvested in various high-growth initiatives, such as the company's foundry services segment. By 2030, Intel anticipates becoming the world's No. 2 chip fabrication company.\n\nIn terms of value, Intel is trading at 25% above its book value of $24.89 per share. With the exception of September 2022-March 2023, Intel stock hasn't been this cheap, relative to its book value, dating back to the mid-1980s!\n\nBaidu\n\nThe fourth bargain AI stock investors can confidently add to their portfolios for the second half of this year is China-based internet search titan Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU).\n\nSimilar to Meta, Alibaba, and Intel, the bursting of the AI bubble wouldn't derail Baidu. That's because it's China's leading internet search engine. Over the trailing-10-year period, it's pretty consistently accounted for 50% to 85% of internet search share for the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. This means predictable operating cash flow and strong ad-pricing power for Baidu.\n\nHowever, AI represents the company's future. Baidu's AI Cloud is China's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure service platform. Meanwhile, Baidu-owned Apollo Go is the world's most successful autonomous ride-hailing service, based on total rides since its inception (more than 6 million). These non-online marketing segments have consistently grown at a faster pace than Baidu's internet search engine.\n\nA forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 7 is unbelievably low for a company sporting roughly $26 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon\n\nThe fifth historically cheap AI stock begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), the world's other dominant e-commerce player.\n\nAccording to estimates, Amazon accounted for a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. But while this segment brings in plenty of revenue, it does little for Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Where the company generates most of its growth and operating cash flow -- and where AI will come in handiest -- is its ancillary operations.\n\nNo segment is more important to Amazon's long-term success than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure services platform and recently topped $100 billion in annual run-rate revenue. AWS can deploy various AI and generative AI solutions to help businesses train large language models and run virtual assistants.\n\nDon't forget about advertising services or subscription services, either. These two segments are also growing by a steady double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis. As Amazon's e-commerce marketplace and content library grow, it should be able to command a premium subscription price for Prime.\n\nAlthough Amazon isn't cheap based on the traditionally used P/E ratio, it is historically inexpensive relative to its future cash flow. Shares can be purchased right now for around 13 times the consensus cash flow in 2025, which is markedly lower than the median multiple of 30 times year-end cash flow investors gladly paid to own Amazon stock throughout the 2010s.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Two Alibaba Group Holding affiliates have become new shareholders of OceanBase, the database company founded by the e-commerce giant's fintech affiliate Ant Group, as the start-up overhauled its shareholding structure and spun off into a separate entity.\n\nHangzhou Junhan and Hangzhou Junao are among 35 companies who became OceanBase shareholders last Saturday after Ant transferred its shares in a share swap arrangement. A number of big names in Chinese venture capital also took part, including China Capital Investment Group, HongShan and Yunfeng Capital, according to Chinese business registry information platform Tianyancha.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe change in shareholders means OceanBase is no longer a wholly owned subsidiary under Ant, which started the database operation in 2010. It is an important step in lining up any potential public listing for the start-up.\n\nAnt had already announced in March that it intended to make OceanBase one of three independent business units with their own boards of directors. The other two companies are Ant International and Ant Digital Technologies. The separation was expected to spur growth and innovation.\n\nThe companies will each roll out their own employee share option programmes, which will be \"more compatible with their start-up status\", Ant said in an internal letter at the time.\n\nOceanBase is an open-source distributed relational database that Ant developed and uses in managing the deluge of data collected through the mobile payment app Alipay and in support of Singles' Day, China's largest online shopping extravaganza started by Alibaba, among other use cases.\n\nTianyancha lists Hangzhou Junhan and Hangzhou Junao - two entities affiliated with Alibaba - as the two biggest shareholders at 25.4 per cent and 19.7 per cent, respectively. The contribution from Junhan was worth 50.9 million yuan (US$7 million) and 39.4 million yuan for Junao, according to the platform.\n\nAlibaba co-founder Jack Ma owns 1.1 per cent of Junhan, while Junao counts Alibaba's current chief executive and his predecessor as shareholders, according to Tianyancha.\n\nThe adjustment comes after Ant took several steps to restructure the company following the last-minute cancellation of its US$39.7 billion initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong in November 2020 amid regulatory scrutiny.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January 2023, Ant Group announced that it would dilute the voting power of Ma, who also founded that company, to make China's largest fintech firm more \"transparent and diversified\". That was deemed a crucial step in putting its highly anticipated IPO back on track.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nAlibaba's supermarket chain Freshippo and Taiwan-based RT-Mart are also part of the one-hour delivery service, according to Taobao.\n\nThe online marketplace has been recruiting more of the brands and merchants on the platform to become suppliers of its one-hour delivery service, \"as long as they have local warehouses that can meet users' instant delivery needs\", the company said in its statement.\n\nAs price-sensitive consumers have shifted an increasing amount of their business to budget-friendly apps like PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo, China's biggest e-commerce players have been scrambling to find creative ways of keeping shoppers on their platforms.\n\nOn-demand delivery for a slew of different types of products has traditionally been the domain of China's two biggest food delivery platforms, Meituan and Ele.me. Now it is the latest battleground in the e-commerce market, with JD.com and Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, having also invested heavily in this area.\n\nDouyin launched a one-hour delivery service in 2022, covering more than a dozen cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou. JD.com upgraded its own one-hour delivery service in May with a new brand called Miaosong, or \"delivery in a second\". The company boasted to Chinese media that in some instances, delivery could be as fast as nine minutes.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith much of China's growth driven by exports, e-commerce platforms are also looking for ways to boost overseas sales. One of Taobao's loftier experiments in this area includes a partnership with domestic rocket developer Space Epoch to research ways of delivering parcels anywhere in the world within an hour, the start-up announced in April.\n\nTaobao also started a major design overhaul of its website in May - its \"biggest update in seven years\". The platform hopes a simplified layout and better search will create a better experience for users.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's second-hand marketplace Xianyu has launched a new feature that enables users to hire themselves out for part-time gigs, as China struggles with high youth unemployment in a bleak job market.\n\nThe function, officially launched on Tuesday, provides users with templates to quickly generate a \"resume\" by uploading a few photos or videos. Customers can place an order and pay, just like they would when buying items on the platform.\n\nThose who provide more than three images or videos longer than 15 seconds are generally better at getting views, according to Xianyu, also known as Idle Fish.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the channel featured hundreds of resumes, offering various services ranging from dancing classes and personal fitness training to graphics illustration, legal services and pet sitting.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nLily Bi, a master's degree student and operator of Quite Studio in Xian, capital of northwest Shaanxi province, said she began using Xianyu's resume feature in June while it was still in beta testing. She offers design services for posters, logos, menus, business cards and more.\n\nIt is \"very easy to upload and edit\" using the resume function, which has boosted the inquiries she received by 50 per cent and led to more orders, Bi said. \"I have also been paid to design other people's resumes for use on Xianyu,\" she said.\n\nBernice Bai, an apparel-industry worker, designs jewellery in her spare time and runs her own brand, Horty. She put her resume on Xianyu on Tuesday and immediately gained 40 followers.\n\nWhile Bai has yet to receive any orders for her design service, she is confident that \"business will come with a growing fan base\".\n\nXiayu's new service comes as young jobseekers across China face a brutal job market. While the urban unemployment rate stood at 5 per cent in May, the jobless rate for 16 to 24-year-olds, excluding university students, was 14.2 per cent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nA job fair in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang province.

The online flea market, which in September posted a 20 per cent growth in daily active users from a year ago, said on Tuesday that such orders made up over 10 million yuan (US$1.38 million) worth of daily transactions, giving sellers an annual side income of more than 2,500 yuan on average.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsulting services for graduate studies, software development and mock interviews are the most popular on Xianyu, according to the platform.\n\nXianyu, which was spun off and rebranded a decade ago from the used-goods channel on the Taobao marketplace, was designated by Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu Yongming last year as one of the e-commerce giant's new pillars for growth, along with wholesale platform 1688, office collaboration tool DingTalk, and search and cloud storage product Quark.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA): The Best Consumer Cyclical Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other consumer cyclical stocks.\n\nConsumer cyclical stocks are highly correlated with the economic cycle. Ideally, you'd want to buy them near the bottom of a recession when their prices are lower, anticipating a recovery and rising consumer spending. Essentially, owning consumer cyclical stocks is a bet that the economy will be growing in the near future. This is in contrast to consumer staples, or consumer defensive, stocks which allow investors to position their portfolio to hedge losses in the case of an economic downturn.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are riskier than their defensive counterparts, they offer higher returns and also come with the corresponding increase in risk. Additionally, while determining the risk of consumer defensive stocks might be relatively easy and off the bat calculations can be used, conducting the same exercise for cyclical stocks is trickier. Investors determine a stock's risk by calculating its beta (\u03b2), which measures the tendency of a stock to move with the broader market. Stocks with a \u03b2 greater than one are more volatile, those with a \u03b2 less than one are less volatile, and a few (like gold mining stocks) can even have a negative \u03b2 that makes their share prices move in opposition to the market.\n\nSo why is measuring the risk of cyclical stocks tricky? Well, research shows that investors can either rely on a 'reasonable' \u03b2 estimate of 0.7 for defensive stocks or narrow them down by stock sector to define a \u03b2 that ranges between 0.6 to 0.8. On the flip side, similar shortcuts are unadvised for calculating the \u03b2 for consumer cyclical stocks. To determine the risk of these stocks, a case by case approach that takes into account the earnings volatility of a firm and the overall business model is recommended.\n\nBuilding on this, consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on the business cycle for their performance. In fact, data shows that if you're able to time the business cycle, then investing in consumer staples stocks can provide an opportunity to lead all other market sectors in terms of return. The business cycle is broadly divided into four phases, the early, mid, late, and recession phases. Each phase is marked by unique economic characteristics, and research shows that consumer cyclical stocks perform the best during the first phase. This phase marks the start of a new business cycle after the previous cycle's recession phase has ended, and its biggest traits are low interest rates and an uptick in economic activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearch shows that the first phase of the business cycle is the one that features the highest sector differentiated performance, with the difference between returns spreading to 25 percentage points. The stocks that lead the returns in this period are consumer cyclical stocks since lower interest rates and an uptick in economic activity allow consumers to have higher discretionary spending and enable businesses to expand operations through easy credit. The 'hit rate' (which measures the percentage of time periods in the business cycle periods in different cycles over time where the sector outperformed) of cyclical stocks during the early phase is 100%, which ties in with the performance of consumer staples in the late stage among all seven stock market sector performance across all phases of the business cycle. In terms of average returns, consumer cyclical stocks return roughly 12% as a category, implying that individual stocks will offer higher returns as the data is influenced by outliers to a large extent.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on business cycles to a large extent and also rely on robust consumer spending, the next step in analyzing their performance is to see how spending varies within the cycle. Estimating what stage of the business cycle we're in is a tricky process, and analysts at the investment bank Morgan Stanley have tried to do so. Their research shows that we are currently in the downturn phase of the cycle, which precedes the early stage we've talked about above. We can also try to determine the business cycle's stage ourselves. Right now, inflation is still trending above trend in America (2.6% PCE in May vs 2% preferred), first quarter GDP growth slowed down (1.6% in Q1 from 3.4% in Q4 2023), and inventories at retailers jumped by 1% annually in February. These three metrics suggest that we might be in the late stage of the business cycle which typically precedes a recession. Consumer spending slows down in the late stages of the business cycles, the downturn and the recession, and neither cycle stage bodes well for consumer cyclical stocks. A key indicator of consumer spending is consumer confidence as it indicates future economic perceptions. On this front, US consumer confidence in March, April, May, and June stood at 103.1, 97, 101.3, and 100.4, respectively. A lower value signals lower confidence, and a value under 80 can signal a recession.\n\nTopping our analysis, let's take a look at how consumer cyclical stocks have recently fared to check whether the conclusions we've reached above are supported by stock market performance. As a refresher, 2024 has been characterized by investors pushing forward interest rate cut expectations and seeking shelter in a few stocks characterized by their strong exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. Two of the most popular consumer staples and defensive stock indexes are those managed by the S&P. Looking at their performance over the past twelve months, these are up by 14.8% and 5.8%, respectively. This is unsurprising since the US GDP has defied expectations during this time period, as it grew by 4.9% and 3.4% in Q3 and Q4 2023 and beat analyst expectations.\n\nHowever, Q1 2024 GDP growth slowed down to 1.6%, which not only missed analyst estimates of 2.4% but also came with some rather ill-boding expectations for consumer cyclical stocks as spending growth slowed down from its 3.3% growth in the previous quarter to 2.5% in Q1. This figure also sat well below Wall Street's 3% estimate. The data was released in April, and the previous release which saw the 0.4% inflation reading for March outdo analyst estimates triggered a 6% drop in the consumer cyclical stock index over the next nine days. Since then, the index has gained 6.57%.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select the best consumer cyclical stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 biggest consumer cyclical stocks in terms of market capitalization stocks by the number of hedge funds that had held a stake in them during Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAn e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 103\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a diversified Chinese company that primarily operates in the eCommerce industry. Data from the Hong Kong based DBS bank shows that Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) had a market share of 40% based on gross merchandise volume. This makes it a dominant player in the industry and provides it with stability in a weak Chinese economy. The sizeable user base, coupled with a cut throat Chinese market full of emerging eCommerce players like Pinduoduo, means that Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) needs to be on its toes if it's to keep its dominant position. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has launched its AI based Alimama tool that enables merchants on its platform to advertise their products based on return on investment (ROI). Like its American peer Amazon, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) also has a sizeable presence in the Chinese cloud computing market (37% share according to DBS). This provides it with a diversified revenue base in a highly lucrative market - particularly so when AI is brought into the product mix.\n\nAlibaba is expected to generate around $20 billion in earnings over the next 12 months. Its current market cap is $175 billion but it has $50 billion in net cash according to Yahoo Finance. This means the stock is trading at an adjusted PE ratio of 6. This is because investors don't trust the Chinese government. We haven't even considered adjusting our valuation metrics for Alibaba's large stakes in other companies and the future potential of its AI and cloud investments. If BABA were a US-based company operating in the US, it would have been trading at around $400.\n\nArtisan Partners mentioned Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\nAlibaba shares declined 7% during the quarter. There isn\u2019t much new to say about Alibaba. There was no meaningful news that drove the share price decline. The earnings for the December quarter were fine, with revenues and profits both increasing 5%\u2014not typically an exciting level of growth, but certainly enough to justify the company\u2019s paltry valuation of 4X\u20135X EBIT. As we have written in recent letters, this is a valuation level that is normally reserved for a dying business, and Alibaba is not a dying business. Management continues to implement changes that are intended to increase shareholder value. Over the past year, they have changed management, adjusted the company structure, contemplated spinning off assets, made progress monetizing the balance sheet and have improved the capital allocation. All of these actions have yet to be reflected at all in the share price. This is a stock that could double and would still be cheap.\n\nOverall BABA ranks 2nd on our list of the consumer cyclical stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Nowto see the other consumer cyclical stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BABA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 30 Wealthiest People in China and in this article we will look at the richest person.\n\nAn Analysis of the Chinese Economy\n\nOn May 29, Reuters reported that China is seeing signs of economic recovery after a long period of sluggish economic growth. Consumer spending in China has started to grow, and the government is actively addressing issues within the real estate industry. China's economy is expected to expand by 5% by the end of this year, from a previous forecast of 4.6%. The IMF reportedly raised its GDP targets for 2024 and 2025 by 0.4 percentage points. On the flip side, the IMF predicts the Chinese economy to drop to 3.3% by 2029 due to its aging population and slow productivity rates. The IMF revised its GDP targets after China reported stronger-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2024. China is now expected to expand by 5% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. While the economy is on track to meet its economic targets, deflationary pressures continue to act as a deterrent to the economic prosperity of China, decreasing consumer confidence. You can also read our piece on the wealthiest people in South Korea.\n\nAre Chinese Investments in Cloud Working Out?\n\nOn October 9, 2023, CNBC reported that the Chinese government intends to increase the country's computing power by 50% by 2025, to 300 exaflops. Exaflop is a performance metric for a supercomputer measuring at least one quintillion floating point operations per second. The government also plans to add six new government departments. The government has deduced that for every 1 yuan they invest in computing power, it returns 3 to 4 yuan of economic output. The need to expand China's computing power is immense, especially in AI, as companies continue to launch AI products for mass consumers and businesses.\n\nOn June 27, Canalys reported that cloud infrastructure spending in Mainland China reached $9.2 billion, up by 20%, year-over-year, in Q1 2024. Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Tencent Cloud account for 72% of the total market in China, a decrease of 2% from the previous quarter. Alibaba accounted for 37% of the spend, 19% of the spend was made by Huawei Cloud, and 16% by Tencent Cloud. While Alibaba Cloud had a market share of 39% in China, the company reported just 2% year-over-year in revenue growth in Q3 2023. Overall, the cloud segment slowed down by 10% in 2022 and 12% in 2023.\n\nAlibaba and its Expansion in Cloud Computing\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is an e-commerce and technology company headquartered in Hangzhou, China. The company, commonly referred to as Alibaba, has an immense focus on developing sophisticated and affordable technology. Alibaba Cloud, also known as Aliyun, is the company's cloud computing infrastructure that provides computing products to businesses. Some of its products include Elastic Compute Services, CloudBox, Alibaba Cloud Linux, Edge Node Services, and Elastic Block Storage, to name a few.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn May 23, the company expanded the availability of its cloud computing products in\u00a0 Mexico for the first time. Alibaba Group also plans to open new data centers in Malaysia, Thailand, and South Korea over the next three years. While Alibaba accounts for only 5% of the global cloud market share, it has captured 39% of the market in China. It recently launched its latest version of large language models after over 90,000 deployments were made by the company. Its latest large language model, Tongyi Qianwen Qwen2.5, is capable of understanding and formulating answers to questions, code, and reasoning in its natural language.\n\nThe company has made significant moves in AI to improve the customer experience. Revenue related to development in AI expanded by triple digits year-over-year. The company plans to establish a competitive edge in the cloud by offering unique offerings at low prices. Over 17,000 small to medium enterprises have subscribed to the company's AI business helper. In the final quarter of 2024, AI-optimized product searches grew by 37%. Moreover, the company has strategically optimized its cross-border synergies to deliver 5 to 10-day delivery completion rates, up by double digits year-over-year. While concerns related to the macro environment in China persist, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) expansion abroad and price cuts may benefit the company.

        "title": "3 Chinese Retail Stocks That Remain a Bright Spot as China Struggles",
        "content": "The Chinese consumer is finally returning to spending, albeit at a slower-than-expected rate. Eventually, once economic confidence is restored, consumers will increase their spending. Green shoots are emerging, making it an opportune time to buy Chinese retail stocks.\n\nThere are two primary reasons for upside. First, China has one of the highest e-commerce penetration worldwide, with an online shopping penetration rate of 83.8%. Due to the high penetration rate, Chinese retail stocks are some of the largest online retailers globally. Furthermore, these retailers are leveraging China\u2019s manufacturing strength to participate in cross-border trade.\n\nSecondly, Chinese retail stocks are trading at significant discounts to their developed market peers. While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 42, these Chinese players are at single-digit and low-teens forward P/E multiples.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEventually, this valuation gap against developed market peers will narrow or close. If these Chinese retail stocks re-rate to similar P/E multiples as their developed world peers, they will easily double from current levels.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccasionally, the market offers undervalued gems with downside protection and substantial upside. As of this writing, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) presents such an opportunity. The largest e-commerce retailer by sales is dirt cheap at nine times forward earnings.\n\nIndeed, Alibaba is one of the best Chinese retail stocks to buy for upside. First, it dominates its home market, China, and key markets across Southeast Asia. Its e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and Tmall, feature an extremely wide breadth of products. As a result, they enjoy substantial network effects that drive traffic growth.\n\nAt today\u2019s valuation, investors are pricing Alibaba for no growth. However, the company will benefit from growing e-commerce penetration. Furthermore, the retailer is investing to drive more growth. For instance, it\u2019s integrating AI tools on its platform to improve the recommendation engine and personalize the shopping experience.\n\nAnother fundamental driver for Alibaba stock is the attractive shareholder returns. As free cash flow improves, Alibaba has returned a substantial portion to shareholders. On February 8, it announced a $25 billion buyback. Consequently, it repurchased shares worth $4.8 billion in the quarter ended March 31. The buyback activity proves that management is focused on shareholder returns going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD.com (JD) JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JD\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the top Chinese retail stocks. Unlike Alibaba, the retailer focuses more on sales of valuable goods such as electronics. By focusing on this niche, JD.com has created a lucrative segment where it\u2019s the leader. Indeed, the company is renowned for its high-quality goods since it sells products from established suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAlthough sales slumped in 2022 and 2023, recent financials suggest a recovery is imminent, which could boost the stock. In Q1 2024, revenues increased by 7% year-over-year (YOY), driven by robust growth in active users. JD.com\u2019s focus on offering the best selection, speed, quality and price combination continues to attract more customers.\n\nDespite the rebound in growth, JD.com is at a rock bottom valuation. According to Seeking Alpha, it trades at a forward non-GAAP P/E multiple of 8 compared to a 5-year average of 32. The steep discount means it\u2019s one of the best Chinese retail stocks to buy.\n\nMoreover, management recognizes the bargain share price and has been aggressively buying back shares. From January 1 to May 15, the company bought back 98.3 million Class A ordinary shares worth $1.3 billion, about 3.1% of ordinary shares outstanding. These buybacks are accretive at these low valuations, making JD stock a buy.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nLastly, one of the best Chinese retail stocks to buy today is Temu\u2019s parent, PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). This e-commerce retailer has the fastest growth rate due to its market share gains in China and internationally. As it continues to successfully challenge incumbents, the stock will soar.\n\nIn Q1 2024, PDD Holdings again showed impressive execution and profited from an improving macro to achieve a 131% revenue growth. This increase was driven by online marketing and transaction services, which grew 56% and 327%, respectively.\n\nLooking forward, the retailer is investing heavily to support high-quality consumption. To this end, it\u2019s broadening its high-quality supply and working with top brands across the globe. Furthermore, it\u2019s investing in technology tools to reduce seller costs and attract more merchants to its platform.\n\nPDD Holdings also sees a significant opportunity in its international business. So far, since launching its cross-border e-commerce platform in September 2022, it has enjoyed tremendous success. A key highlight has been the strong consumer adoption of Temu in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nDue to its best-in-class growth, PDD Holdings is one of the Chinese retail stocks that deserves a premium multiple. At 11 times forward earnings, PDD stock is a no-brainer buy. Even better, a PEG non-GAAP multiple of 0.50 reinforces that this is an undervalued growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Alibaba, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Alibaba Gr Hldgs, the 200-day moving average sits at $77.22, according to Benzinga Pro, which is above the current price of $72.15. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal.

        "content": "Buying undervalued stocks may provide substantial profits for investors, particularly if the underlying businesses\u00a0are poised\u00a0for a huge upswing. These three cheap stocks have a lot of potential and should rise significantly by 2025. Investors looking to optimize their returns must comprehend the basics of these organizations. The businesses\u2019 strong foundations\u2014such as their resilient e-commerce platforms, global expansion into digital commerce, and leadership in AI and cloud computing\u2014highlight the industry\u2019s significant development potential. Similarly, their strategy\u2019s emphasis on client involvement and operational efficiency has increased transaction volumes and profitability.\n\nFinally, a robust content pipeline, strong box office results, and creative technology investments highlight growth potential and resilience. These are undervalued stocks, and finding and buying them may be profitable since the firms have\u00a0solid\u00a0fundamentals and may take advantage of opportunities down the road. By examining the growth drivers and strategic advantages of these businesses, it is possible to increase the value of a portfolio and generate significant returns.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) leads the global e-commerce and cloud computing giant. Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG) are Alibaba\u2019s two\u00a0leading\u00a0e-commerce platforms. They are the important foundations of its expansion strategy. These platforms have demonstrated strong performance with double-digit annual gross\u00a0merchandise volume (GMV)\u00a0growth in Q4 fiscal 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates rising consumer spending and transaction volumes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) has considerably improved the company\u2019s international income diversification. AIDC announced a noteworthy\u00a045% rise in revenue, attributed to robust results in the retail and wholesale sectors. In particular, AliExpress has effectively extended its international retail activities, with a 20% annual rise in orders.\n\nMoreover, Alibaba is another\u00a0important\u00a0development driver thanks to its expertise in cloud computing. Alibaba Cloud\u2019s revenue increased by\u00a0double digits in the previous year because of growing customer utilization of its AI-related products and public cloud services. Alibaba has become a pioneer in AI technology because of its superior infrastructure and strong relationships with top Chinese enterprises.\u00a0This\u00a0is seen in the triple-digit growth in revenue connected to AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Alibaba is on the undervalued stock list due to its solid performance in core e-commerce platforms and international digital commerce growth.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) leads in online payment solutions. The company reached $3.5 billion in transaction margin dollars, a 4% increase, indicating greater operational efficiency. Higher interest rates on client balances, improved performance in branded checkout systems, and efficient cost-control strategies were the main drivers of this development. The company\u2019s mark on sustainable expansion aligns with its focus on increasing profitability through\u00a0smart\u00a0pricing and operational savings.\n\nMoreover, PayPal\u2019s operational income increased\u00a0by 15%. With that, its operating margin increased by 0.84% to 18.2%.\u00a0This\u00a0demonstrates the success of its efforts to minimize costs and increase margins. Further, PayPal attracted 2 million new active accounts consecutively, hitting 427 million total active accounts, despite a modest decline in total active accounts year over year. This expansion demonstrates PayPal\u2019s capacity to draw in and hold onto a sizable client base worldwide. Additionally, there is a 13% rise in transactions per active account over the previous 12 months\u2014to 60 transactions, demonstrating the company\u2019s attempts to enhance client involvement.\n\nIn summary, PayPal\u2019s focus on improving operational edge, transaction margin dollars, and customer engagement makes it the top pick among undervalued stocks.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is a leader in the media and entertainment industry. The studio\u2019s division has had a solid performance, with Warner Bros. bringing in more than $1.8 billion from worldwide box office receipts since 2024\u2019s start. Here, the studio was the first in 2024 to break the $1 billion mark in global and international box office receipts. The company plans to make the most of its robust content pipeline to maintain its momentum in theatrical releases.\u00a0This\u00a0includes highly anticipated blockbusters like \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the company may have a\u00a0sequential increase in advertising income in Q2,\u00a0mostly\u00a0due to growth in direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales and significant sporting events. Warner Bros. Discovery has demonstrated endurance in global markets, with positive revenue growth in strategic areas, including Germany, Italy, and Poland. Initiatives like Ad-Lite solutions in Latin America and EMEA may even strengthen ad revenue tactics. The goal of investments in content discovery algorithms, enhanced ad targeting, and AI-powered consumer offers is to maximize ad-break chances in premium content.\n\nTo conclude, Warner Bros. Discovery is at the top of the undervalued stocks list because of its strong box office performance, technological investments, and advertising revenue.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in BABA, PYPL and WBD.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's family of large language models (LLMs) - the technology underpinning generative artificial intelligence (AI) services like ChatGPT - has been ranked among the world's top 10 open-source models.\n\nThree of the four top 10-ranked Chinese LLMs were from the Tongyi Qianwen series, also known as Qwen, developed by e-commerce and cloud computing giant Alibaba, according to AI and machine-learning developer platform Hugging Face, which released its updated leaderboard with new metrics on Wednesday. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nHangzhou-based Alibaba's Qwen-72B-Instruct LLM topped the list with an average score of 43.02 across six benchmarks. This Qwen model was trained on 72 billion \"parameters\" - a machine-learning term for variables present in an AI system during training, which helps establish how data prompts yield the desired output.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"Qwen 72B [Instruct] is the king and Chinese open models are dominating overall,\" Hugging Face co-founder and chief executive Clement Delangue said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday.\n\nThe Tongyi Qianwen large language models, developed and operated by Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit, are used in industries ranging from consumer electronics to cars and online games. Photo: Shutterstock alt=The Tongyi Qianwen large language models, developed and operated by Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit, are used in industries ranging from consumer electronics to cars and online games. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nThat particular Qwen model was credited for \"its performance in maths, long-range reasoning and knowledge\", according to Wednesday's post on Hugging Face developer community's website.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba's Qwen-72B and Qwen1.5-110B models made it to the third and tenth spots, respectively, as of Thursday. The rankings are expected to change over time, as more LLMs get evaluated, according to Hugging Face.\n\nThe Yi-1.5-34B-Chat model from Beijing-based start-up01.AI was ranked seventh. The firm was founded in 2023 by prominent venture capitalist Lee Kai-fu, who was formerly president at Google China.\n\nThe lofty recognition of Alibaba's LLMs shows the company's rapid progress in AI on the back of its strong commitment to open-source development. Tongyi Qianwen was opened to third-party developers over several months already.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpen source gives public access to a program's source code, allowing third-party software developers to modify or share its design, fix broken links or scale up its capabilities. Open-source technologies have been a huge contributor to China's flourishing tech industry over the past few decades.\n\nAlibaba Cloud chief technology officer Zhou Jingren said in May that the Tongyi Qianwen large language model family has been adopted by more than 90,000 corporate clients. Photo: Handout alt=Alibaba Cloud chief technology officer Zhou Jingren said in May that the Tongyi Qianwen large language model family has been adopted by more than 90,000 corporate clients. Photo: Handout>\n\nFacebook parent Meta Platforms' AI model took second spot behind Alibaba in Hugging Face's top 10 list. One LLM from Microsoft, a major backer of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, was ranked sixth.\n\nThe Hugging Face community said on Wednesday that its methodology for ranking AI models added more metrics, such as complex problems of around 1,000 words in length, at a time when AI \"performances are plateauing\".\n\nSince the Hugging Face ranking is focused on open-source-developed programs, it excludes advanced LLMs developed in a proprietary environment like OpenAI's GPT.\n\nThe LMSYS Chatbot Arena ranking by the University of California, Berkeley, and the Large Model Systems Organisation was topped by GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest LLM introduced in May. Alibaba's Qwen2-72B-Instruct was ranked 19th.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

These resources are stored and managed inside data centres.\n\nThe latest initiative by Alibaba Cloud, mainland China's leading cloud infrastructure services provider, reflects the company's efforts to attract more customers in major markets amid headwinds from geopolitical tensions and a lack of advanced chips used in data centres for artificial intelligence (AI) projects.\n\nAlibaba Cloud still trails major US rivals - including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - which accounted for 31 per cent, 26 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, of the global cloud infrastructure services market in the fourth quarter last year, according to data from tech research firm Canalys.\n\nStill, Alibaba Cloud's latest initiative could open potential new deals for the company.

        "content": "With the European Cup underway, it might be worth considering how sports play a role in the broader perception of companies. Some companies, despite being relatively unknown, pour significant sums of money into marketing during major sporting events. Other stocks are directly linked to the sporting events, giving them a leg up in organic marketing and product placement.\n\nWhile for most Americans, the European Cup does not change their perceptions about companies like BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and AliExpress (NYSE:BABA), Europeans still make up a generous portion of the global markets for sports and commercial stocks alike. Thus, keeping an eye on which companies successfully weave into the marketing of the European Cup can be a good clue as to their potential future performance in the short term.\n\nAs such, here are two sports stocks and one commercial stock that are likely to benefit from the increased exposure the European Cup is currently providing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdidas (ADDYY) An image of four blue and white Adidas Originals shoe boxes stacked on top of each other with the three white stripes on each box lined up with each other in front of a speckled stone wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith the European Cup currently being held in Germany and the overall dominance of Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) sports products in central Europe, Adidas potentially has one of the best chances to gain market share from this year\u2019s tournament. The company, which is known for its endorsement of star athletes and providing the kit for several European teams, including the Germans, has carved out a reputation for high quality, exceptional fashion, and overall success in the European market.\n\nNow, with the release of several redesigned retro shoes, like the Samba and Gazelle, Adidas has also successfully broken into the casual sneakers market once more. The company\u2019s products stand as an alternative to competitors\u2019 more well-known branding by using unique colorways and materials to stand out.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, Adidas\u2019 first-quarter earnings report provided general relief to many investors after it struggled with revenue and profit generation in 2023. With a 3.5% increase in revenue year over year and a quarterly net income of 170 million EUR, this sports stock seems headed in the right direction for a nice bump in share value should it repeat the results in the next earnings report.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother sneaker and sportswear giant, Nike (NYSE:NKE) has managed to outcompete Adidas for uniform visibility in the European Cup. Nike remains the most represented brand with nine teams (37.5%) compared to Adidas\u2019 6 teams (25%). This kit visibility extends beyond the European Cup and was the case for the last World Cup, where Nike dominated team branding as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Nike\u2019s dominance extends beyond both world competitions into the club scene, where it sponsors several of the most elite and most followed clubs, such as Paris St. Germain, Real Madrid, and Chelsea.\n\nKeep an eye on the Nike earnings call today, as it may clue investors into whether or not the company\u2019s big push in organic professional sports marketing paid off this year. That said, Nike\u2019s market dominance is not likely to erode so quickly that it cannot rebound.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust like how summer and football (soccer) go hand-in-hand, so too does Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and major sports sponsorship. Despite Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s disdain for the company during the 2021 European Cup, which saw KO stock value dip 1.6% due to Ronaldo advocating for water over the soft drink at a press conference, Coca-Cola is back in full swing as a sponsor of this year\u2019s European Cup.\n\nCoca-Cola itself may not be the drink of choice for high-level athletes, but it certainly is the most popular soft drink in the world among those watching the tournament. Taking a look at Coca-Cola\u2019s financials, we see steady performance so far this year with a generous growth of 9% in share value over the last six months.\n\nIts first quarter results showed relatively positive metric growth in revenue, and net income, despite a slight decrease in profit margins. This trend is likely to continue into the next earnings report for the second quarter as Coca-Cola continues to focus on marketing expenses for the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Lilly and Innovent Biologics Inc. are also developing a local weight-loss drug that is expected to launch next year.\n\nBloomberg report adds that Novo Nordisk has struggled to meet global demand for Wegovy and Ozempic, but it continues to manufacture semaglutide in Denmark and North Carolina and is planning final production stages in China.\n\nA 4 billion yuan factory expansion in Tianjin was announced in March.\n\nWhile China\u2019s national health insurance covers Ozempic for diabetes, Wegovy is unlikely to receive similar reimbursement.\n\nAs a result, Wegovy will likely target those able to pay out-of-pocket, allowing Novo Nordisk to set prices independently.\n\nCurrently, Ozempic is available on major Chinese platforms like JD.comInc (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) Tmall.\n\nPrice Action: NVO shares are down 0.10% at $143.52 at last check Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by Tobias Arhelger via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nStory continues\n\nNOVO NORDISK (NVO): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Novo Nordisk To Restrict Initial Wegovy Sales In China Amid High Demand originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "MSME Day 2024: Alibaba.com Commits to Scaling AI Tools for MSMEs",
        "content": "Strategic plans for a diverse supplier network and enhanced trade opportunities unveiled\n\nGENEVA, June 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Alibaba.com, a leading platform for global business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce and a unit of Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, today honored businesses in their pursuit of success and global growth ahead of Micro-, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (MSME) Day on June 27. Reaffirming its dedication to supporting MSMEs, Alibaba.com said it has been rolling out artificial intelligence (AI) tools for global suppliers, which have so far attracted adoption by around 30,000 businesses on its platform. Kuo Zhang (left), President of Alibaba.com, stresses the importance of including MSMEs from underdeveloped countries in the AI era, in a session moderated by James Howe (right), Head of Digital Connectivity at ITC, held in celebration of MSME Day.\n\nThis year's MSME Day marks the seventh anniversary of the United Nations' designation to recognize the vital role played by MSMEs in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the contributions of MSMEs to the global economy. On this meaningful occasion, Kuo Zhang, President of Alibaba.com, participated in a panel discussion on the topic of global trade during the World Trade Organization's (WTO) bi-annual Global Review of Aid for Trade. Together with four MSMEs from Ethiopia, Vietnam, Italy and India, Zhang also joined a session held by the United Nations International Trade Centre (ITC) to celebrate MSME Day.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of ensuring that no MSMEs in underdeveloped countries are left behind in the era of AI, Zhang mentioned that among the top 20 countries making the most frequent use of Alibaba.com's AI tools, approximately 10 are developing countries.\n\n\"As a member of the private sector, we are honored to have worked alongside international agencies such as ITC and supported MSMEs worldwide over the past 25 years,\" said Zhang. \"As we promote wider adoption of our AI tools amongst MSMEs, we also hope to expand our global supplier base to cover 100,000 suppliers in the next three years. In a nutshell, we are building a global supply chain by and for MSMEs leveraging AI.\"\n\nMSMEs Embrace the Power of AI\n\nA recent survey conducted by Alibaba.com of MSMEs that utilize its platform showed that they are regularly seeking out innovative solutions and offerings like AI. In fact, 25%-30% of the MSMEs surveyed use AI on a daily basis.\n\nOn Alibaba.com alone, approximately 30,000 MSMEs globally are using the platform's AI tools. As a result of leveraging these tools, the companies surveyed saw a 37% increase in product exposure, creating greater opportunity for new business deals and growth. Additionally, those MSMEs surveyed that are already utilizing Alibaba.com's AI tools are furthering their businesses through AI's expertise, as they have collectively accepted 70% of the optimization suggestions from the tools.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Using AI has helped put my Alibaba.com store on autopilot and saved us a lot of time since it's just me and one employee managing our business,\" said Sieu To, Deputy Managing Director of Hanh Sanh Co., Ltd, a Vietnam-based electric fan company. \"For many business owners who are new to e-commerce, I think AI tools will draw them closer to the platform.\"\n\nMSMEs Have Growing Access to Global Suppliers\n\nIn addition to a growing suite of innovative solutions to support their businesses, MSMEs on Alibaba.com can diversify their product sources by connecting with suppliers with specific industry and product focuses. These key global digital supply chain clusters include the following:\n\nIn Northeast Asia, buyers can connect with natural ingredient skin care suppliers out of Korea and partner with home furniture and camera, photo and accessory manufacturers in Japan. In Southeast Asia, Vietnam is the supplier hub for seasoning and condiments, as well as home and outdoor furniture. Buyers can also seek out expert suppliers in India and Pakistan for loose gemstones and horse racing gear. In West Asia and Europe, carpets, men's clothing and construction and building machinery suppliers can be found in T\u00fcrkiye. Buyers are able to tap into suppliers in Germany for industrial machinery and suppliers of wine, textile machinery and women's apparel from Italy.\n\n\"As one of the first Italian businesses on Alibaba.com's platform, I have always had faith in our quality Italian supplements products. Alibaba.com has helped me expand my business beyond Europe into markets like China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Ghana,\" said Maria Francesca Aceti, CEO of Deltha Pharma.\n\nAlibaba.com Expands Supplier Support in Developing Countries\n\nAs Alibaba.com seeks to expand its supplier base, it is stepping up its efforts to onboard suppliers in developing countries. Of note, Alibaba.com is setting out to help 100 MSMEs across Africa establish a presence on its platform to sell their products globally. Additionally, of the 500 events and seminars Alibaba.com is rolling out this fiscal year (April 2024 to March 2025) for global suppliers, about 300 are set to be held in developing nations.\n\n\"Starting with brick-and-mortar and transitioning to e-commerce has been a strategic journey for my business,\" said Dagmawit Abebe, owner of Ethiopian coffee brand Kedemt Coffee. \"Leveraging e-commerce platforms like Alibaba.com has been crucial in overcoming local market challenges and expanding our reach.\"\n\nAlibaba.com connects more global MSMEs now than ever before, serving more than 48 million buyers and more than 200,000 suppliers on its platform worldwide. Alibaba.com will continue to place MSMEs at the forefront through innovation and new solutions focused on simplifying global sourcing and selling.\n\nAbout the Survey:\n\nIn May 2024, Alibaba.com conducted a survey of 500 businesses on Alibaba.com across the globe. These businesses ranged in size from one employee to those with 250 or more.\n\nFor more information on Alibaba.com and the report, please visit:\r\nhttps://seller.alibaba.com/playbooks/2024-msme-day-report-px002b6lu?categoryid=1239008\n\nAbout Alibaba.com\n\nLaunched in 1999\u00a0as Alibaba Group's first business, Alibaba.com is a leading platform for global business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce that serves buyers and suppliers from over 200 countries and regions around the world.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding is giving developer access on DingTalk to six Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-ups to expand generative AI features on the workplace messaging platform, in its latest bid to gain an edge in the increasingly competitive market.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based e-commerce and cloud computing giant, which has built its own AI model Tongyi Qianwen, is partnering with MiniMax, Moonshot AI, Orionstar, Baichuan, Zhipu Ai and 01.AI to develop new AI functions for DingTalk, the platform said said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move comes as Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, puts AI at the core of its business strategy and promotes DingTalk to more enterprise clients. DingTalk's rivals, including Tencent Holdings' WeCom and ByteDance's Feishu, are also rushing to incorporate AI models into their products.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nFor the six start-ups collaborating with Alibaba, the tie-up is expected to help introduce their AI products to more users faster via China's biggest workplace communication tool by user numbers.\n\nBy the end of 2023, DingTalk said it had over 700 million users, including 25 million organisations ranging from corporate to educational institutions.\n\nDingTalk's new AI partners represent some of the leading players in China's heated race to catch up with top global competitors in the sector.\n\nBaichuan, Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI and MiniMax are known locally as the \"four new AI tigers\".\n\nBeijing-based unicorn 01.AI, which runs an open-source AI model Yi, was founded by Lee Kai-fu, a venture capitalist and former president of Google China.\n\nOrionStar, established in 2016, in January launched a medium-scale model Orion-14B that the company said has outstanding performance among models with less than 20 billion parameters.\n\nDingTalk said that by combining the strengths of various models, it can provide users with a variety of offerings that include industry-specific and client-customised solutions.\n\nFor example, it is working with Moonshot AI to explore the application of AI's long-text processing and generative capabilities in educational scenarios.\n\nThe Alibaba Group headquarters in Hangzhou, in eastern China's Zhejiang province.

Around 500,000 customised AI agents had been created on DingTalk by the end of May, the platform said.\n\nTongyi Qianwen will continue to support some existing features on DingTalk, such as instant messaging, document processing, audio and video-related functions, the platform said.\n\nDingTalk last year integrated a number of Tongyi Qianwen-supported AI features into the platform, allowing users to compose articles or generate social media posts based on simple text prompts, and provide new members of a group chat with a summary of previous conversations.\n\nDingTalk said it currently has over 5,600 ecosystem partners, including more than 100 entities involved in building AI models, agents, solutions and plug-ins.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Over the years, the semiconductor chip company invested in designing powerful chips that could support accelerated computing. Now, it\u2019s reaping the rewards.\n\nNotably, the company has emerged as the undisputed leader in AI chips. Its AI chips are critical in training large language models as well as inference. Due to its technological advantage and lower total cost of ownership, its chips are in high demand. It counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as key customers.\n\nCapitalizing on demand, Nvidia revenues have soared over the past year. For instance, revenues for the fiscal year ending January 2024 grew 125%. As a result, GAAP diluted earnings per share surged an astounding 586%.\n\nAnalysts expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2025 after Q1 earnings highlighted the continued strength in demand. GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter rose 629% year-over-year (YOY), driven by Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and operating leverage.\n\nAs long as Nvidia continues to beat expectations, it will remain one of the growth stocks with best EPS. Wall Street consensus estimates call for over 109% growth in EPS for fiscal year 2025. Demand isn\u2019t slowing and Nvidia will continue marching higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) has been a real disruptor in the e-commerce market, taking share from incumbents. In China, it has been grabbing market share from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) by offering steep discounts and targeting lower-income consumers.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s following the same playbook in developed markets. One good example is its approach in the U.S. It launched its shopping app Temu, which offers heavily discounted items. Then, it followed up with an aggressive marketing campaign with ads at the Super Bowl and across various social media sites.\n\nSince launching Temu, PDD has been in growth mode, blowing past analyst estimates. After growing revenues by 123% YOY in Q4 2023, growth accelerated to 131% YOY in Q1 2024. Even better, net income soared by 246%. These results reinforce why PDD stock is among the growth stocks with best EPS to buy today.\n\nWall Street analysts are also bullish and Goldman upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy,\u201d raising the price target from $145 to $184. Analysts Ronald Keung and David Ma increased their 2024 to 2026 profit estimates by 25% to 43% as they see sustained revenue momentum. Even looking at valuations, PDD is one of the top growth stocks with best EPS to buy today. Finviz estimates 77% EPS growth this year, yet PDD stock trades at 12 times forward EPS.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America is another stock riding the e-commerce wave to tremendous growth. Over the past five years, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has grown revenues at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57%. More growth lies ahead given the potential for increased penetration of e-commerce in Latin American markets.\n\nMELI is among the growth stocks with best EPS based on its growth profile. Over the past three years, EBIT has grown at a 109% CAGR. The forward outlook is even more attractive. According to Finviz, the e-commerce giant has grown trailing twelve-month EPS by 82% YOY. What\u2019s more, analysts expect EPS to increase by 77% this year and 35% in 2025.\n\nFundamentally, MercadoLibre is firing on all cylinders and can surpass these estimates. Q1 2024 was another strong quarter as total revenues increased from $3.18 billion to $4.33 billion, a 36% YOY growth rate. Key markets experienced strong growth, with Brazil and Mexico reporting 44% and 55%, respectively, after excluding reporting updates.\n\nLooking ahead, management sees secular opportunities for its e-commerce and fintech business. As more buyers shift online and customers seek simpler financial services, Latin America\u2019s e-commerce leader will soar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Bargain Alert: 7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy Hand-Over-Fist",
        "content": "I think it is a good idea to buy some undervalued long-term stocks on weakness before they start to make a recovery. The current market environment is quite unforgiving for many stocks as investors have piled into just a few tech stocks. However, as the market cycle reaches an inflection point after the rate cuts, I believe many of these long-term stocks will deliver huge gains.\n\nMoreover, many of these stocks have very little downside risk as they have seen significant selloffs. This makes it very appealing compared to the long-term upside many of these businesses have. Profitable companies with an established brand are highly unlikely to disappoint you in the long run if you hold them through the storm.\n\nThus, here are seven long-term stocks that are trading at bargain levels:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCVS Health (CVS) The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stock\n\nSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com\n\nCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) operates one of the nation\u2019s largest health services companies. The stock has tumbled over 44% from its peak as the company faces significant headwinds. CVS posted disappointing Q1 results, with EPS of $1.31, missing estimates by 38 cents, largely due to surging Medicare Advantage costs that management failed to anticipate.\n\nHowever, I believe the steep selloff provides an attractive long-term buying opportunity. CVS should benefit as interest rates decline, reducing the burden of its $82 billion debt load. Management is also taking decisive action to rein in Medicare expenses. You shouldn\u2019t scoff at the rate-cut tailwinds, since interest expenses ate up nearly a third of operating income. Long-term stocks: How CVS makes its money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFurthermore, the healthcare sector enjoys powerful demographic tailwinds from an aging population. As one of the largest and most diversified healthcare companies, CVS is well-positioned to capture this rising demand over the long run. You can sit on its 4.4% dividend yield as it recovers.\n\nDollar General (DG) The logo for Dollar General Corp (DG) is displayed on a discount storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDollar General (NYSE:DG) operates a chain of discount retail stores across the United States. I am confident that Dollar General is one of the best retail stocks you can buy for the long haul, especially given the recent pullback in the share price. While net sales grew a healthy 6.1% YOY to $9.9 billion, the stock has been weighed down by near-term headwinds. However, I believe these are temporary speed bumps for a company that has a long track record of steady growth and profitability.\n\nLooking ahead, Dollar General is poised to benefit from some powerful tailwinds. Value remains the top priority for shoppers across multiple income ranges in this inflationary environment. Dollar General is perfectly positioned to gain wallet share as consumers tighten their belts. I expect the stock to creep up as EPS recovers.\n\nStory continues DG EPS\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company\u2019s popularity with cost-conscious shoppers, coupled with its 1.84% dividend yield, makes it a compelling pick for bargain-hunting investors willing to ride out the near-term volatility. While the road ahead may be bumpy, I am convinced that this profitable retail stalwart will stage a solid recovery in the coming years as earnings rebound.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is a global leader in prestige beauty. Despite facing headwinds from the inflationary environment and reduced consumer spending on discretionary items, I believe Est\u00e9e Lauder is poised for a solid long-term recovery once the market cycle turns a corner.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Estee Lauder delivered organic sales growth of 6%, exceeding expectations for profitability and significantly improving working capital. The company is confident that the second half of fiscal 2024 will prove to be an inflection point for sales and profit growth.\n\nAs a consumer discretionary company, Estee Lauder is undoubtedly cyclical. However, with the stock down nearly 69% from 2021 prices and top-line growth remaining in positive territory, I think now presents an attractive opportunity to buy shares at the trough. Estee Lauder\u2019s profit recovery plan will deliver $1.1-$1.4 billion of incremental operating profit in fiscal 2025 and 2026. I think this positions the company well to accelerate sustainable growth.\n\nDoubleVerify (DV) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDoubleVerify (NYSE:DV) is a software platform for digital media measurement and analytics. Even though the stock has plunged nearly 48% year-to-date on the heels of lowered guidance, I believe the market has overreacted. In Q1, DoubleVerify still managed to grow revenue by 15% YOY to $141 million, surpassing analyst estimates.\n\nWhile net income did decline, management is still projecting full-year revenue growth of 17% at the midpoint of their revised $663-$675 million range. This is much lower than analyst estimates, but I think that this has been more than priced in by the stock\u2019s correction.\n\nDespite the near-term turbulence, DoubleVerify seems well-positioned to capitalize on the inexorable shift of ad dollars into digital video formats like social media and CTV. With social video ad spending expected to surge 20% this year and 81% of DoubleVerify\u2019s Q1 social measurement volumes coming from video, the company\u2019s AI-powered solutions are primed to excel. In my opinion, the recent valuation haircut seems far too harsh for DV.\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPrologis (NYSE:PLD) is a real estate investment trust that invests in logistics facilities. While real estate companies have faced intense headwinds recently, I believe Prologis remains a bargain long-term stock to buy hand-over-fist.\n\nCustomers are focused on controlling costs, and net absorption was below average in Q1, but management expects limited new supply in late 2024 and into 2025. Prologis delivered strong 68% net effective rent growth based on commencements, and their in-place leases have a substantial 50% mark-to-market, representing over $2.2 billion of additional rent potential. Occupancy also remains high at 97%, and same property revenue has been surging. PLD same property revenue\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nMoreover, I\u2019m not too worried about a real estate crash, as logistics real estate demand should keep growing due to onshoring trends. Real estate prices have also been relatively muted compared to other assets. With a solid 3.5% dividend yield, I think the recent dip provides an attractive entry point for this high-quality REIT.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) operates China\u2019s largest e-commerce platforms and cloud computing business. While the stock has disappointed many in the post-pandemic era amid a sluggish Chinese market, I believe Alibaba could deliver huge upside from here. The Taobao and Tmall Group achieved double-digit GMV growth this quarter, and Alibaba International Digital Commerce revenue surged 45%.\n\nMost promising is the cloud segment, where revenue increased double-digits and AI-related sales skyrocketed triple-digits year-over-year. As China loosens monetary policy and Alibaba slashes cloud prices, Chinese firms are likely to pile into homegrown cloud leaders over Western providers. As such, I think Alibaba\u2019s growth is poised to reaccelerate.\n\nIt\u2019s a long-term bet but one with immense potential if these tailwinds play out. The stock may have a cloudy reputation currently, but blue skies could be on the horizon. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic this e-commerce and cloud giant is turning the corner.\n\nLululemon (LULU) the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wall\n\nSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) designs and sells apparel and accessories for active lifestyles. The current consumer discretionary downturn has undoubtedly weighed on Lululemon\u2019s stock. LULU stock has declined nearly 39% year-to-date. However, I believe this makes it one of the best long-term stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe company delivered revenue growth of 10% (11% in constant currency), driven by continued strong momentum in international markets like China (+52%) and the broader \u201crest of world\u201d segment (+30%). And while North America saw a more modest 4% growth, I\u2019m encouraged that Canada still achieved a solid 12% gain. Same store sales have also been over double digits over the past few years. It has naturally slowed down after the 2021-2022 boom, but it remains solid. On the other hand, sales per store has been creeping up steadily. LULU same store sales and sales per store\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nLooking ahead, I expect Lululemon\u2019s addressable market to fuel a reacceleration in growth as discretionary pressures eventually ease. With analysts projecting 10-11% annual top-line gains and 10-15% EPS growth going forward, I believe the recent selloff offers a compelling entry point for long-term investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Growth Stock Down 73% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The past three years have been tough for China's e-commerce outfit JD.com(NASDAQ: JD). Ditto for shareholders.\n\nLike so many other names in the business, this company and its stock sizzled during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, like so many of its peers, the wind-down of the contagion and the subsequent economic malaise have proven challenging for JD. Shares are down 73% from their early 2021 peak and still just 32% above the multiyear low reached this past January. Investors are understandably discouraged.\n\nAs the old adage goes, it's darkest before the dawn. This is precisely the time forward-thinking investors should be stepping into a new position in JD stock.\n\nHere's a closer look at what makes this particular ticker so bullish right now.\n\nJD.com is more different than similar\n\nIn a market dominated by Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA) online-shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall at the same time investors are recently enamored of Temu parent PDD(NASDAQ: PDD) (you may know it better as Pinduoduo), JD.com just isn't turning many heads.\n\nDon't be fooled, however. While smaller and lesser known than its chief rivals, in many regards JD is the better bet.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nOn the surface, JD is just another e-commerce player. It is different, however, from Tmall and Taobao. Whereas Alibaba's platforms offer third-party sellers access to consumers through its online malls, JD.com largely is the seller. It does work with third-party vendors but with a large network of over 1,600 of its own warehouses, plus more than 2,000 third-party-operated warehouses, plus a delivery-logistics network that's arguably better-developed than Alibaba's, it's got far more control of a customer's entire online shopping experience. It's also very cost-efficient in terms of receiving, storing, and then shipping goods to buyers, with a great deal of its warehousing work now handled by robots.\n\nThis hasn't necessary helped keep the stock propped up of late. China's prolonged pandemic lockdowns took a clear economic toll, crimping the country and its neighbors' economic growth. Many investors -- once bullish on all-things China -- have lost faith and lost interest in JD and its peers. They're now moving on to seemingly more compelling opportunities like artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nDon't make the same mistake, especially now that we're seeing signs of rekindled growth from the region and from JD.com in particular.\n\nGrowth on the (near-term) horizon\n\nContrary to a common assumption, China's economic-growth engine is finally revving again. Take last month's retail spending as an example. It improved to the tune of 3.7% year over year versus expectations of only 3% growth, accelerating from April's pace of only 2.3%. This marks the 16th consecutive month of some degree of year over year growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe nation's industrial companies are picking up steam as well. While last month's industrial output fell short of expectations of 6%, its growth pace of 5.6% is still quite healthy.\n\nAll told, S&P Global Market Intelligence now believes China's GDP will expand 4.8% this year, led by exports. That's up from its previous growth estimate of 4.6%. It's also growth that's expected to linger into next year.\n\nLargely unnoticed by investors is the fact that JD.com is already capitalizing on this fresh tailwind and expects to continue doing so.\n\nHow so? Last quarter's healthy top-line growth of 7% is largely attributable to the company's deliberate effort to position itself as a low-price leader.\n\nAs CEO Sandy Xu made a point of pointing out during May's earnings call: \"As our improved price competitiveness increasingly resonates with users, the growth of our user base in lower tier cities accelerated in Q1, overtaking growth in higher tier cities.\"\n\nCFO Ian Su Shan added during the call that \"we're confident that our 2024 full-year growth will outpace China's total retail sales of consumer goods,\" nodding to the benefit of its scale and reach.\n\nReading between the lines, JD's management team understands and utilizes the company's unique strength. That's offering lower prices than its competitors without sacrificing speed or quality of service in an inflation-riddled environment.\n\nIt's a cost-competitive edge that rivals like Tmall, Taobao, and PDD just aren't in a position to match at this time. Indeed, until March of this year, Alibaba was planning on spinning off its logistics business. The reversal of this decision may be a hint that the company knows it needs to become more competitive with JD.com rather than risk losing control of this one aspect of its e-commerce operation.\n\nJD stock is as undervalued as JD.com is underestimated\n\nRisks remain, of course. Chief among them is economic uncertainty, which seems more pronounced in China than elsewhere. Beijing's regulators also have something of a penchant for unexpectedly clamping down on individual companies as well as select industries. There's also the simple risk that you may not be hearing everything there is to know about a particular organization until well after the fact. JD.com is no exception to this prospect.\n\nOn balance though, with shares priced at less than nine times this year's projected per-share profits of $3.29, the potential reward here justifies the risk. Last quarter's growth pace should persist at least through next year, with earnings expected to grow at an even faster clip.\n\nThis might help: Of the 46 analysts now covering this stock, 33 of them rate it as a strong buy, while another five call it at least a buy. Their current consensus price target also stands right around $40 per share, which is roughly 40% above the stock's present price.\n\nEven if the average investor isn't seeing better days on the horizon, the pros clearly are.

        "title": "Chinese teen in Alibaba maths finals sparks awe, controversy after beating MIT students",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's annual global maths contest finished on Saturday with all eyes on a 17-year-old vocational school student who has bested hundreds of competitors from prestigious universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and Tsinghua University, generating intense interest and speculation online.\n\nThe Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition, which has been hosted by Alibaba's Damo Academy annually for the past six years, except 2019, held the finals for this year's event over the weekend, with results to be announced in August. The star of the event was Jiang Ping, a fashion design student who recently beat artificial intelligence (AI) teams and students from top institutions to rank 12th leading into the finals. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAs a student at Lianshui Secondary Vocational School in eastern Jiangsu Province, Jiang has stood out among the roughly 800 finalists, a group that also includes students from University of Cambridge and Peking University. Vocational schools in China are generally considered to be for students whose grades are not good enough to be admitted by high schools, where students study and prepare to take the university entrance examination, or gaokao.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"Learning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems, I feel quite happy,\" Jiang told the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily in a video interview this month. \"No matter what the future holds, I will keep learning [maths]. I have never thought of giving up.\"\n\nDamo Academy, Alibaba's research arm, has hosted the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition since 2018. Photo: Weibo alt=Damo Academy, Alibaba's research arm, has hosted the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition since 2018. Photo: Weibo>\n\nJiang is the only person to have reached the final round who is not from an elite university either in China or overseas. She told Qilu Evening News that she chose the vocational school because her elder sister and some good friends study there.\n\nHer performance in the Alibaba competition has attracted widespread attention, both from netizens and official news media.\n\n\"The story of Jiang Ping tells us that we must further optimise the talent identification and cultivation mechanism, so that talented and hard-working people can stand out as soon as possible ... [and] every piece of gold can shine,\" the state-run Xinhua News Agency said in a post on microblogging platform Weibo.\n\nStory continues\n\nDamo Academy declined to comment for this story. Jiang could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe national attention has also sparked scrutiny and some controversy. Since Jiang passed the initial test to reach the finals, other contestants have questioned her scores and maths competence.\n\nIn a joint letter sent to the organising committee last Wednesday, 39 other finalists said Jiang \"made several apparent writing mistakes\" while solving a problem on a blackboard in a documentary video released by Damo Academy. \"It appears that she seemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols,\" the contestants wrote.\n\nThey demanded that the committee conduct an independent investigation of their concerns, including cited allegations that Jiang was assisted by her teacher Wang Runqiu.\n\nWang reportedly discovered Jiang's talent for maths during a monthly examination two years ago, when she scored nearly 140 out of 150, while her classmates' scores were around 50 to 60, according to the Qilu Evening News.\n\n\"She is a self-disciplined girl,\" Wang told the newspaper. \"When her classmates are playing around, Jiang Ping spends all her spare time studying maths.\"\n\nIn a joint letter sent to the competition's organising committee, 39 other finalists complained of \"writing mistakes\" made by Jiang Ping in a video released by Damo Academy. Photo: Weibo alt=In a joint letter sent to the competition's organising committee, 39 other finalists complained of \"writing mistakes\" made by Jiang Ping in a video released by Damo Academy. Photo: Weibo>\n\nDiscussions online about Jiang's capabilities have been circulating since Richard Xu, who claimed to be one of the signatories of the joint letter, released the document publicly on social media on Sunday. He said the organising committee had yet to respond.\n\nMany people online still see Jiang's story as inspirational, however, and have voiced support on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. News of her achievement received more than 6 million likes on the short video app.\n\n\"What an amazing girl! I admire her efforts and genius. I wish her a bright future,\" said one online observer.\n\nAnother added, \"She is an extraordinary person from an ordinary environment.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "OpenAI\u2019s China Block to Reshape AI Scene as Big Players Pounce",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI\u2019s abrupt move to ban access to its services in China is setting the scene for an industry shakeup, as local AI leaders from Baidu Inc. to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. move to grab more of the field.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor Trump Could Actually Lose Florida. Here\u2019s Why. Nvidia Rout Takes Breather as Traders Scour Charts for Support Rivian Gets $5 Billion Lifeline in Joint Venture With Volkswagen Julian Assange Leaves Court \u2018Free Man,\u2019 Ending 14-Year Drama\n\nThe ChatGPT creator this week sent memos to Chinese users warning it will cut off access to its widely used AI development software and tools from July, triggering a scramble to fill the void. Since Tuesday, at least a half-dozen companies and startups including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Zhipu AI began offering incentives to developers making the switch.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s shift will accentuate the divide between China and the US, which is trying to curb Beijing\u2019s AI and chip efforts. While the startup\u2019s exit offers an opportunity for sector leaders to grow their user base, it also deprives entrepreneurs and cash-strapped startups of some of the best tools available to fine-tune or get their AI applications off the ground.\n\nFor China, that could help usher out many smaller startups created during the \u201cbattle of a hundred models,\u201d in the wake of ChatGPT\u2019s late 2022 debut. And a bigger concern may be whether open-source models like Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Llama also cut off access, said Bernard Leong, chief executive officer of Singapore-based Dorje AI.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a bloodbath of the large language models and I suspect that there\u2019s probably going to be very few players left,\u201d said Leong, who\u2019s also founder of the tech podcast Analyse Asia. \u201cThere will be very few winners, and those will be the biggest in China.\u201d\n\nChinese artificial intelligence-related stocks, including Alibaba and Iflytek Co., rose on Wednesday.\n\nThe major firms were quick to sense the opportunity.\n\nFor users migrating from OpenAI, Baidu promised free AI model fine-tuning and expert guidance on its flagship Ernie model, along with 50 million free tokens that developers can use to query the bot. Alibaba and Tencent posted ads encouraging the shift. Tech pioneer Kai-fu Lee\u2019s 01.AI touted heavy discounts.\n\nBaichuan, which is backed by both Alibaba and Tencent, offered 10 million free tokens. SenseTime Group Inc. dangled 50 million. Zhipu put forth 150 million tokens and a series of training sessions to ease the transition. Even Microsoft Corp. \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s biggest backer \u2014 published a step-by-step guide on WeChat on how to migrate to its local service, operated by local partner 21Vianet.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS firms such as OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet Inc. have led the world in generative AI, which spits out text, images and video from simple commands. Underpinning those models are application programming interfaces that developers use to build up and refine their own platforms to integrate services either with the likes of ChatGPT, or their own proprietary models.\n\nThat was a boon to Chinese developers starting from scratch, who accessed OpenAI\u2019s tools through virtual private networks or other ways around the country\u2019s Great Firewall. Many local developers \u2014 particularly those without deep pockets \u2014 favored training AI systems and applications via OpenAI\u2019s tools, because they were regarded as industry benchmarks.\n\nOpenAI is now threatening to sever the connection.\n\n\u201cLeading Chinese large language models can benefit from the restricted access to OpenAI, and it will help to filter out smaller, less effective players from the market,\u201d said You Chuanman, head of the Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen\u2019s IIA Centre for Regulation and Global Governance. \u201cAt the same time, it will make it harder for Chinese developers to use the most advanced global AI algorithms.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s move coincides with rising pressure from Washington to curb Chinese access to the most advanced artificial intelligence and semiconductor technology. The US Treasury Department advanced plans over the weekend to further restrict investments by US individuals and companies into China, with a focus on curtailing next-generation technologies.\n\nIn the long run, industry experts say a lack of access to global tools may further impede Chinese AI players in general as they play catch-up to the US. Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai has said it would take at least two years for homegrown AI models to match US ones.\n\nIt could also accelerate a migration overseas by Chinese tech startups seeking faster-growing markets with less political uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThis situation is directly related to the ongoing competition between China and the US in frontier technologies,\u201d said Neil Zhu Xiaohu, the founder and chief scientist of University AI, which trains Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cWe had US laws targeting Chinese semiconductors previously and more recently, there are semiconductor and AI work restrictions, so the restriction of China\u2019s API services is not something that happened out of the blue.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Saritha Rai, Zheping Huang and Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Why BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford Corporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History Independence Without Accountability: The Fed\u2019s Great Inflation Fail\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alibaba BABA is leaving no stone unturned to boost technological innovation driven by generative AI. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, AI-related revenues witnessed a triple-digit growth year-over-year.\r\n\r\nBuilding on this momentum, Alibaba\u2019s cloud division, Cloud Intelligence Group, recently unveiled the \u201cAI programmer,\u201d powered by the company\u2019s in-house large language model (LLM).\r\n\r\nThe AI programmer combines software architect, development engineer, and test engineer roles to help developers shorten application development times, sometimes to minutes.\r\n\r\nAlibaba aims to gain solid popularity among individual and corporate developers on the back of the AI programmer.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this launch has added strength to Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group\u2019s overall portfolio.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nGrowing Generative AI Efforts Aid Alibaba Cloud\n\nPer a Statista report, the generative AI market is expected to hit $36.06 billion in 2024 and reach $356.10 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 46.5% between 2024 and 2030. Alibaba is well-positioned to capitalize on this solid growth opportunity on the back of its expanding generative AI-backed offerings.\r\n\r\nAlibaba recently launched Qwen2.5, an upgraded version of its family of LLMs, Tongyi Qianwen. Qwen2.5 offers significant improvements in reasoning, code comprehension, and textual understanding, demonstrating competitive results to programmers.\r\n\r\nAlibaba also updated Model Studio, its AI model and application development platform, to offer a wider range of models and sophisticated AI tools. Developers can now access over one hundred models from AI companies like Baichuan AI, and the platform also incorporates an open-source framework for application development.\r\n\r\nAlibaba\u2019s launch of its AI programming assistant, Tongyi Lingma, remains noteworthy. It enhances software development efficiency, reducing test code implementation time by over 70% and saving developers hours of manual work.\r\n\r\nThese efforts to strengthen its generative AI-backed portfolio are expected to continue driving Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group\u2019s performance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the segment generated revenues of RMB 25.6 billion ($3.5 billion), up 3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStiff Competition Hurts Alibaba\n\nHowever, Alibaba faces stiff competition in the generative AI market against players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, which are making concerted efforts to strengthen their dominance in the market.\r\n\r\nRecently, Microsoft introduced new generative AI and data solutions for retailers, enabling personalized shopping experiences, empowering store associates, and unifying retail data. These solutions include Azure OpenAI Service copilot templates, retail data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights copilot features and Retail Media Creative Studio.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon is riding on its AI-powered assistant, Amazon Q, allowing conversations, problem-solving, content generation, and insights. It connects to company information repositories, code, data, and enterprise systems, promoting task efficiency, decision-making and innovation.\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s Google is capitalizing on the increasing demand for large language models with its most powerful AI model, Gemini. Solid momentum in Google\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlibaba\u2019s shares have declined 1.4% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry\u2019s return of 16.1%. BABA\u2019s shares have underperformed Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s gain of 19.5%, 22.1% and 28.4%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable estimate revision is also noteworthy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.20 per share, indicating a 4.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The figure has decreased by 1.1% in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nDespite the stiff competition, Alibaba is benefiting from its growing generative AI efforts, strong momentum across its international commerce retail and wholesale businesses, and expanding China's wholesale commerce business. These factors are expected to continue driving its top-line growth in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 total revenues stands at $138.63 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.2%.\r\n\r\nAlibaba currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "When choosing stocks, investors sometimes like to follow the example of billionaires -- often despite not knowing the motivations behind such holdings. But these investment titans may have purchased shares at a lower valuation. In other cases, they might be sitting on years of dividend gains that are less meaningful to an investor today.\n\nUltimately, billionaires have their own reasons for buying and holding specific stocks. Yet, some of the holdings -- especially if recently purchased -- could be appropriate for smaller investors. Let's take a look at three such stocks right now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAmid rising interest in AI, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has attracted the interest of billionaires such as Bill Ackman at Pershing Square Capital.\n\nIndeed, the recent public interest in AI was driven primarily by other companies. When the public saw the capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT, investors turned on Alphabet on the assumption that the longtime AI leader had fallen behind its peers.\n\nHowever, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI product in Gemini. Moreover, it has long led the way in AI, having first introduced AI to its search engine in 2001. It became an AI-first company in 2016 and today drives AI innovation through Google DeepMind.\n\nFurthermore, its $108 billion in liquidity gives it the resources necessary to stay on top. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, of 27, the stock also has the lowest earnings multiple among the tech megacaps, an attribute that likely attracted Ackman's attention and could bring higher returns as it catches up to its peers.\n\nAlibaba\n\nAnother intriguing stock is Alibaba(NYSE: BABA), which drew the interest of billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management. Although it is the leading e-commerce conglomerate in China, its stock has suffered amid political turmoil. Alibaba is an American Depositary Receipt rather than an actual stake in Alibaba.\n\nSuch arrangements are only cause for concern if its home country has deteriorating relations with the U.S. Unfortunately, this has been the case with Alibaba, and it has lost value since its 2014 initial public offering (IPO) as a result. BABA Chart\n\nStill, the U.S. and China have much to lose if such an arrangement falters, making it more likely that Alibaba stock will survive.\n\nIndeed, Alibaba's revenue has increased almost 18-fold since between fiscal 2014 and 2024. Plus, its stock has traded in a range for the last two years. With rising profits and a P/E ratio of just 17, it sells at a massive discount to similar businesses in other countries such as Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nUltimately, Alibaba is not suitable for risk-averse investors. Still, if one can stomach the political risk, the stock could become a tremendous opportunity to buy an e-commerce conglomerate at a huge discount.\n\nSnowflake\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) may be one of the more surprising choices of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as Buffett has often avoided IPO investments in the past.\n\nNonetheless, investors should watch Snowflake for its leadership in the data cloud market. Its product allows organizations to manage, store, and secure data in one central, cloud-based repository. So compelling is the software that Amazon has offered it to some of its cloud customers despite selling its own data cloud product.\n\nAdmittedly, investors had highly valued the stock before a slowing of earnings, and a sudden change at the CEO level rattled investors. However, in the first three months of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30), its net retention rate -- a measure of recurring revenue from existing customers -- stood at an impressive 128% as Snowflake's usage-based revenue model sometimes compels customers to spend more money on the platform.\n\nMoreover, amid a falling stock price, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at a record low of 14. Hence, buying in this period of relative struggle may pay off for investors as more customers benefit from its data cloud product.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Selling It in Favor of These 7 Top-Notch Stocks",
        "content": "Since the dawn of the internet three decades ago, no next-big-thing investment trend has turned heads quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith AI, software and systems have the ability to learn and evolve over time without human intervention, which gives the technology application in virtually all sectors and industries. It's the reason PwC's analysts believe artificial intelligence could add close to $16 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.\n\nAlthough numerous companies within and outside the tech sector stand to benefit from the rise of AI, it's semiconductor colossus Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) that's become the face of this technological revolution. Nvidia's high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) have quickly become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. According to semiconductor analysis company TechInsights, Nvidia accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped in 2023.\n\nWith enterprise demand for these chips outpacing supply, Nvidia has also enjoyed otherworldly pricing power for its H100 GPU. During the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia reported a better-than-quintupling in sales and an adjusted gross margin that topped 78%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDespite seemingly doing everything right from an operating standpoint and generating plenty of buzz with a 10-for-1 stock split, Nvidia stock has, nonetheless, been shown to the door by more than a half-dozen billionaire investors.\n\nEight billionaire money managers have given the world's AI leader the heave-ho\n\nNo later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing provides an in-depth look at what Wall Street's brightest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter. Based on the most recent round of 13F filings, eight prominent billionaires were sellers of Nvidia stock, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nThe second consecutive quarter of top-tier billionaire investors selling Nvidia stock might represent nothing more than simple profit-taking. After all, Nvidia has been the best-performing megacap stock, and we've simply never witnessed a company this large scale this quickly before.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it's also hard to ignore the role history has played in next-big-thing investments trends, as well as the growing competition in the AI arena.\n\nIncluding the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a game-changing technology, innovation, or trend for three decades that didn't endure an early stage bubble. Without fail, professional and everyday investors overestimate the uptake or utility of innovative trends, which eventually leads to disappointment and lofty valuations contracting in a big way. History is most-definitely not in Nvidia's corner.\n\nIncreasing competition is also worrisome for Nvidia. Even if Nvidia's GPUs retain compute advantages over its external competition, the company's inability to satisfy an overwhelming amount of demand for AI chips should allow other AI-GPU developers to succeed and \"chip away\" at its market share.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four largest customers are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. This signals a clear desire by Wall Street's biggest and most-influential businesses to lessen their reliance on Nvidia's hardware. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThese are the top buys of billionaires who were selling Nvidia stock\n\nBut just because eight prominent billionaires were selling shares of Nvidia, it doesn't mean they weren't putting their capital to work elsewhere. Here are the seven stocks these billionaires were piling into during the first quarter.\n\n1. Philippe Laffont: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (10,027,552 shares purchased)\n\nInterestingly, Nvidia's biggest seller in the March-ended quarter chose to gobble up shares of the world's leading chip-fabrication company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semi has rapidly increased its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which is a necessity for the high-bandwidth memory packaging that makes AI-accelerated data centers tick.\n\nAlthough Acts of God (e.g., Taiwan's major earthquake in April) and geopolitical tensions with China threaten to disrupt a still-fragile semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semi has a relatively clear path to consistent demand given the rise of the data-center economy.\n\n2. Ken Griffin: Hess (8,815,580 shares purchased)\n\nThe second-biggest seller of Nvidia stock in the first quarter, billionaire Ken Griffin, was a busy buyer of oil and gas stock Hess(NYSE: HES). It's an intriguing purchase, to say the least, given that Hess agreed to be acquired by Chevron in a $53 billion all-share dea.\n\nWhile macro factors have constrained the global supply of oil and are helping juice the margins of Hess's drilling segment, it's possible Griffin's stake has more to do with an arbitrage opportunity. Based on the proposed deal of 1.025 shares of Chevron for each share of Hess, the latter is currently trading at 8% below the implied deal value, as of the closing bell on June 21.\n\n3. Israel Englander: Merck (4,021,500 shares purchased)\n\nInstead of next-generation tech stocks, Millennium's billionaire fund manager opted to buy more than 4 million shares of cutting-edge pharmaceutical company Merck(NYSE: MRK). Merck is the developer of the best-selling cancer immunotherapy in the world, Keytruda, which is pacing more than $27 billion in annualized run-rate revenue, through March 2024.\n\nMerck's extensive oncology pipeline and foundational operating segments, including vaccines and its animal health division, set the stage for predictable cash flow and steady earnings growth.\n\n4. Stanley Druckenmiller: Coherent (2,525.070 shares purchased)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller was the top buyer of optoelectronics company Coherent(NYSE: COHR) in the first quarter. Coherent is a manufacturer of silicon carbide wafers, which are believed to be a next-generation solution for the electric vehicle (EV) industry. When compared to traditional silicon-based solutions, silicon carbide offers higher efficiency, superior thermal conductivity, and top-tier electrical properties. In short, it could meaningfully improve the driving range for EVs.\n\nTo boot, Coherent appointed Jim Anderson as its new CEO (only the fourth in the company's 53-year history) three weeks ago. Anderson is credited with turning around semiconductor solutions provider Lattice Semiconductor.\n\n5. John Overdeck and David Siegel: Pfizer (8,419,014 shares purchased)\n\nWhile selling shares of Nvidia, Two Sigma's billionaire duo of John Overdeck and David Siegel were big-time buyers of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer(NYSE: PFE). Even though sales from Pfizer's blockbuster COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral therapy (Paxlovid) are set to come in at a combined $8 billion in 2024, down from more than $56 billion (combined) in 2022, the company's overall drug portfolio, sans COVID-19 therapies, has continued to grow.\n\nAdditionally, the $43 billion acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen vastly expands Pfizer's oncology pipeline and should result in meaningful cost savings and earnings per share improvement beginning next year.\n\n6. David Tepper: Alibaba (6,900,000 shares purchased)\n\nAppaloosa's billionaire boss looked overseas and absolutely piled into China's leader in e-commerce, Alibaba(NYSE: BABA). Last year, the International Trade Administration pegged Taobao's and Tmall's combined share of China's online retail sales at nearly 51%!\n\nAlibaba is also China's leading cloud infrastructure services platform. With enterprise spending on cloud services still in its relative infancy in China, the expectation would be for Alibaba Cloud to become a significant cash-flow driver in the second-half of the decade. Keep in mind that Alibaba ended March with over $85 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments on its balance sheet.\n\n7. Steven Cohen: Broadcom (470,365 shares purchased)\n\nThe seventh top-notch buy during the first quarter by Nvidia's biggest billionaire sellers was semiconductor networking solutions provider Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Point72 Asset Management's Steven Cohen grabbed more than 470,000 shares of Wall Street's newest stock-split stock.\n\nBroadcom's solutions are proving critical to getting the most out of Nvidia's advanced GPUs. For instance, Broadcom's Jericho 3 AI chip is reducing tail latency and optimizing compute capacity by connecting up to 32,000 AI-GPUs.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Broadcom is a key provider of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones and vehicles.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-China's retail outlook dims after mid-year shopping festival flop",
        "content": "By Casey Hall\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Retailers in China face a daunting near-term future after a disappointing mid-year online shopping festival that has also clouded the recovery prospects of the world's second-largest economy.\n\nE-commerce sales declined for the first time during the so-called 618 festival that ended last week, reports said, reflecting the pressures building up on retailers who are already locked in a gruelling price war.\n\nThe festival, named after the June 18 founding date of e-commerce provider JD.com but embraced by all platforms, is China's second-biggest annual sales event after 'Singles Day' in November and is seen as a key indicator of household consumption.\n\nThe two events once showcased the rampant rise of Chinese consumerism, providing a reliable bump in sales for platforms and brands alike. The last time Alibaba reported Singles Day revenue, in 2021, sales hit $84.54 billion over the event's duration.\n\nThis year, 618 has instead proven just how hard it is to get consumers spending at all.\n\n\"Chinese spend has been basically focused on sales opportunities and coupons. If they're not spending during this (618 sale), when on earth are they going to consume?\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, Asia Pacific chief economist at Natixis.\n\nTo be fair to the event, discounts have become available year-round since the pandemic, with retailers competitively offering them to woo belt-tightening consumers, thereby helping stunt sales growth during big shopping festivals.\n\nSales during the marquee Singles Day shopping bonanza last year grew just 2%.\n\nWhile the discounting has helped slow the flow of consumers away from platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba-owned Tmall and Taobao to low-cost players such as Pinduoduo, it has not supercharged consumer spending - recent quarterly results showed revenues for Alibaba's domestic e-commerce arm rose by only 4%.\n\nInvestors also remain unconvinced, with Alibaba shares trading around 5% down this year and JD.com down over 3%.\n\nBut the bigger concern is weak consumer sentiment, which has remained stubbornly low since 2022.\n\nA new Bank of America's China consumer survey found that sentiment weakened further in June.\n\nThe share of respondents who plan to spend more over the next six months fell to 45% in June, compared to 55% in April. And only 31% of respondents are expecting an increase in income over the next six months, a fall of 10 percentage points from April.\n\n'EVEREST COMMERCE'\n\nJosh Gardner, CEO of Kung Fu Data, which manages online stores for over a dozen global brands, said e-commerce in China is commonly referred to as \"Everest commerce\" for its enormous sales peaks around 618 and Singles Day.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut these peaks may become less pointy as sales periods lengthen and consumers lose interest, turning instead to everyday discounts offered, for example by livestream shopping on platforms such as ByteDance-owned Douyin, he said.\n\n\"I think what we're seeing this year is a shift away from full price retail altogether... It's more rational consumption and caution and looking for value,\" Gardner said.\n\nConsumers in China have been reluctant to spend amid concerns about their personal wealth fuelled by a real estate slump, stunted wage growth and high youth unemployment, putting at risk China achieving its stated economic growth goal of \"around 5%\" this year.\n\nBut rather than stimulate consumption - as they once reliably did - festivals such as 618 might be working against a consumption rebound in a year like this in which everyone is focused on buying what they need at the lowest possible price.\n\nKang Li, a 45-year-old mother-of-one who works in sales in the southern city of Changsha, is among those who are turning more frugal and shunning purchases of non-essential items.\n\n\"(I bought) household essentials, and some clothes and shoes for my kid, plus my own skincare products,\" Kang said, referring to her 618 shopping this year.\n\n\"Basically, I stock up on these when shopping events like 618 come around so I don\u2019t need to purchase them again for half a year,\u201d when Singles Day rolls around, she added.\n\nJason Yu, greater China managing director of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel, warned that the coming months would be challenging for retailers as people bought what they needed during 618.\n\n\"This pantry loading behaviour is an overdraft of the future consumption potential... July is going to be very challenging,\" he said.\n\nGarcia-Herrero of Natixis forecast the second half is likely to see retail sales growing only by low single digits, meaning consumption's share of China's GDP will shrink rather than expand as many economists believe it needs to.\n\n\"This is terrible news for rebalancing the global economy because China will continue to have to export its way out of trouble,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Casey Hall and Shanghai newsroom; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

In that report, analysts expect Alibaba to post earnings of $2.24 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 6.67%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $34.95 billion, up 8.22% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $8.20 per share and a revenue of $138.63 billion, signifying shifts of -4.87% and +6.23%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Alibaba.

        "content": "Many times, companies go through times of crisis before, eventually stepping back out stronger than ever. These events lead to multiple investors losing faith in the company and pulling their shares out. However, if the company reverses the negative trend it\u2019s stuck in, investors who keep their shares have the potential to make a large return on their investment.\n\nOne of the best metrics used to decide whether a company is a \u201cgrowth\u201d stock or not is to use analyst price targets. These price targets, which are generally a year out, define what analysts believe are suitable price ranges for said company. A relatively high price target means the company will see considerable growth in the stock price, making it a worthy investment. Here are three China stocks to buy based on my analysis.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese multinational conglomerate specializing in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media and logistics. It operates platforms like Taobao and Tmall, offers cloud services through Alibaba Cloud and provides digital payments via its affiliate, Ant Group\u2019s Alipay.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBABA stock is currently trading at $73.67, with a market cap of $178.4 billion. It has gone down 56% in the past 5 years. Despite this decline, analysts predict a target price estimate of $107.51 \u2014 suggesting a potential growth rate of 46% over the next year. The company maintains positive financials, with a profit and operating margin of 8.50% and 13.35%, respectively. Additionally, an operating cash flow of $183 billion is also a positive indicator.\n\nAlibaba has strong growth prospects, with the group just introducing its first AI programmer, powered by its proprietary large language model (LLM). Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has added Alibaba, along with JD.com (NASDAQ:JD),\u00a0to one of the apps used on their Vision Pro, launching in China on June 28. These advancements position BABA as a compelling China stock to buy on the dip, with strong potential for future growth and innovation.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JD\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com is a Chinese e-commerce giant providing a wide range of products, including electronics, apparel and groceries. Known for its robust logistics network, JD.com ensures fast, reliable delivery and also offers services like JD Logistics, JD Health and JD Cloud.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at $28.10, with a market cap of $43 billion. It has gone down 19.5% in the past years. Despite this decline, analysts predict a target price estimate of $42.51 \u2014 suggesting a potential growth rate of 51% over the next year. It has consistently beaten EPS predictions, with an average surprise of 17.5% over the past year. Multiple financial institutions have rated JD stock as Overweight and Outperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has been profitable and has crossed revenue of $1 trillion for the past two years. Plus, recent expansions \u2014\u00a0like adding four new 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) aircraft to its fleet \u2014\u00a0indicate strong growth prospects. A high potential growth rate and resilient financials make JD.com a definite China stock to buy on the dip.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) operates a multinational e-commerce portfolio, including Pinduoduo and Temu marketplaces. It connects businesses and consumers digitally, offering diverse product categories like apparel, electronics and more. The company generates revenue through commissions and fees from sellers on its platforms.\n\nPDD stock is currently trading at $143.86 with a market cap of almost $200 billion. The stock is down 4% this month, but I expect this negative trend to reverse at any time. Analysts have predicted a one-year target price estimate of $202.64,\u00a0indicating a growth potential of 40.8%.\n\nA year-on-year quarterly earnings growth of 245.60%, combined with the fact that this stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year, underscores its strong operational performance.\n\nAs e-commerce continues to expand globally, particularly in emerging markets, PDD is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth trajectory. In Q1 2024, the Temu app boasted 167 million monthly active users globally, a significant surge from 23.4 million users in Q1 2023, marking a remarkable 614% year-over-year growth. This explosive growth, combined with positive analyst feedback and stellar financials make PDD a stock to buy, especially on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned -9.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.24 per share, indicating a change of -6.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 points to a change of -4.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.20 indicates a change of +12.2% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alibaba is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $34.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.2%. The $138.63 billion and $148.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.2% and +7.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $30.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +12.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Retail Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Retail sales are moving at a sluggish pace but several trends suggest that strong buy retail stocks will yield high returns in the long-haul.\n\nIn a year marked by inflationary concerns, high unemployment and fed rate cuts, the retail industry is experiencing a major slowdown. Retail sales in May grew slightly at 0.1% versus last month and 2.3% over last year. This came in below the anticipated 0.3% increase this month.\n\nHowever, the long term prospects for the industry remain positive. Spurred by rapid economic growth and tech innovations the Bureau of Economic Analysis expects retail sales in 2024 to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%. Furthermore, the integration of AI, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) solutions in digital platforms is set to enhance the shopping experience.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite the current challenges, analysts remain bullish on several companies in the space, rating them as strong buys. These stocks show promise of significant long-term upside, making it the perfect time to get in while prices remain favorable.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) has been on a winning streak for the last few years. Fueled by the expansion of its store footprint, loyalty programs and Gen Z splurging more on beauty products, the company has managed to stay on top of analysts\u2019 buy lists, despite a recent slowdown in sales.\n\nIn its recent earnings report, the company reported a 1.6% increase in comparable sales versus the prior quarter. While this was an improvement, it was still a considerable decline from the same period last year. The dip is a result of declining demand in its prestige beauty category where Ulta struggles to gain market share. Nevertheless, shares of the company gained 11% following its CEO\u2019s optimistic strategy to boost sales in the second half of the year.\n\nAs a historically strong performer in the retail sector, Ulta\u2019s low price is an opportune time to invest in the stock. The company has a highly differentiated business model, catering to a wide customer base with brands across different price segments.\n\nIn addition to a strong product portfolio, Ulta also generates revenue from its in-store services and rewards customers through its loyalty program. This will serve as catalysts for the company growth when the markets recover.\n\nAnalysts at Loop Capital and TD Cowen seem to agree, giving the stock a buy rating and price upside in the $500 to $520 range. ULTA is currently among the top strong buy retail stocks based on 27 analyst ratings.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s been a slow couple of years for Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) but several trends point to a strong recovery on the horizon. The e-commerce giant\u2019s financial performance was clouded by fierce industry competition and macroeconomic concerns that ate into its market share. BABA stock has been trending lower and is down considerably from its pandemic-induced highs in 2020.\n\nWhile the stock charts don\u2019t paint a pretty picture, analysts predict a major upside potential for the company. One reason for this optimistic outlook can be attributed to its recent earnings report. Alibaba reported a 4% increase in its e-commerce business, a 2% rise over the previous quarter. Looking ahead the company anticipates higher growth rates that will be fueled by its cloud and AI businesses. These initiatives will potentially drive double digit revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nWhile the immediate future still remains a challenge, analysts continue to remain bullish on the stock\u2019s performance. Loop Capital gave BABA stock a buy rating and a 45% price upside. Citigroup maintains a similar rating, predicting a 53% price increase. Analysts\u2019 sentiments towards Alibaba makes this the perfect time to get in on this strong buy retail stocks.\n\nLovesac (LOVE) Lovesac store sign at Florida Mall in Orlando, Florida, USA. Lovesac is an American furniture retailer, specializing in a patented modular furniture system. LOVE stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile furniture stocks don\u2019t warrant the most enthusiastic responses from investors, Lovesac (NASDAQ:LOVE) is a name that stands out from the crowd. The small-cap growth stock is perhaps well known for its \u201csanctionals\u201d which are small modular couches that can be rearranged in endless ways to fit your space. This unique piece of furniture has served a huge catalyst for its growth, accounting for 90% of total net sales.\n\nIn addition to its eco-friendly furniture, Lovesac\u2019s growth is also driven by its omni channel sales platforms. The company has a digital presence, 147 pop-ups in Costco (NASDAQ:COST), locations in 41 Best-Buy (NYSE:BBY) and partnerships with several retailers. This helps the company enhance brand visibility while keeping operating costs minimal.\n\nIn its recent earnings report, Lovesac shares gained on a narrower than expected net loss amidst a challenging market environment. Revenue came in at $132 million, surpassing expectations of $128 million. Full year guidance set between $700 million to $770 million.\n\nKeeping with this optimistic outlook, analysts remain bullish on LOVE stock as the market continues to recover in the latter part of the year. Roth/MKM maintains its buy rating on the stock with a price target of $30. Lovesac is also rated among the top strong buy retail stocks based on six analyst ratings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Liang Yan, a developer in the cryptocurrency industry, sees the AI programmer as a potential threat to jobs, noting that it might reduce opportunities for novice programmers and prevent them from fully understanding their work.\n\nYang Yi, a developer at a Chinese Big Tech company, mentioned that while these tools reduce workload, they are not entirely reliable, often generating code with grammatical or factual errors.\n\nRecent reports indicated Alibaba fintech affiliate Ant Group investing $2.9 billion in AI research in 2023.\n\nAlibaba stock has lost 14% in the last 12 months as domestic rivalry and a weak economy takes its toll.

        "content": "Elon Musk claims there are \u2018far more\u2019 smart, hardworking people in China than in the US\n\nThe U.S. has long held the title of the world's leading economic powerhouse, boasting the highest GDP both overall and per capita.\n\nHowever, China's rapid ascent is reshaping the global economic landscape. According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, this formidable economic power from the east possesses a distinct advantage over the U.S.\n\nDon't miss\n\nBeating the market is no myth: These expert stock-pickers' recent success could help you build generational wealth 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs \u2014 take advantage today These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n\u201cThe sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible,\u201d Musk said during a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman. \u201cHow many smart, hardworking people are there in China? There\u2019s far more of them there than there are here, I think, in my opinion, and they\u2019ve got a lot of energy.\u201d\n\nThe tech billionaire highlighted the country\u2019s infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cThe architecture in China that\u2019s in recent years is far more impressive than the U.S. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high-speed rail, everything, it\u2019s really far more impressive than what we have in the U.S.,\u201d he noted. \u201cI recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings, and go take the train from Beijing to Xi\u2019An, where you have the terracotta warriors.\u201d\n\nOver the past few decades, China has embarked on numerous ambitious projects, including the construction of the world's largest high-speed rail network, extensive modern highways, and countless bridges, including some of the longest in the world.\n\nIf Musk is right and China has a uniquely strong and dynamic workforce driving its economy, the country could present unique investment opportunities.\n\nUnfortunately, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is less than 1% higher so far this year. According to a Reuters article from April, the stock market has struggled because the economic recovery remains bumpy and uneven, the real estate sector is in a prolonged downturn, pension and endowment funds in the U.S. and its allies have cut China\u2019s exposure to avoid political risks and there's been a regulatory crackdown on the tech sector.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at two easy ways to tap into this growing market.\n\nInvest in Chinese stocks\n\nOne of the most direct ways to capitalize on China's economic growth is through investing in Chinese companies. China's stock market, which includes major exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, offers a wide array of opportunities in sectors such as technology, consumer goods, and renewable energy.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile there are complexities involved in international investing, quite a few Chinese companies are listed on American exchanges through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which allow U.S. investors to buy shares in foreign companies relatively easily.\n\nFor instance, investors can consider stocks like Alibaba (BABA), a dominant force in Chinese e-commerce, and Baidu (BIDU), the leading search engine provider in China.\n\nRead more: \u2018You didn\u2019t want to risk it\u2019: 80-year-old woman from South Carolina is looking for the safest place for her family\u2019s $250,000 savings. Dave Ramsey responds\n\nInvest in Chinese ETFs\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to pick individual companies, another effective strategy for capitalizing on China's economic growth is through investing in exchange-traded funds. ETFs offer a more diversified approach than individual stocks because they hold a wide range of assets, reducing the risk associated with the performance of any single company.\n\nThese days, there are many ETFs that provide U.S. investors access to China \u2014 you can even choose whether you want exposure to the entire market or specific industries within China's expansive economy. Some popular names include the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI), which focuses on large Chinese companies, and the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), which targets China's fast-growing internet sector.\n\nWhen considering investment in ETFs, it's important to be mindful of the associated fees. ETFs typically charge management fees and other expenses in exchange for managing the fund, and these costs can vary widely between funds. These fees can impact the overall return on your investment, making it essential to understand and consider them before committing your capital.\n\nRisks\n\nKeep in mind that although investing in Chinese companies through ADRs is convenient, it's been difficult for American investors to assess the true financial health and performance of Chinese companies.\n\nThe good news is the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced a series of measures to step up supervision of listed companies and vet initial public offering (IPO) applications. The regulator said it would crack down on securities fraud as well as accounting manipulation, reported Reuters\n\nInvestors should also be aware of risks associated with regulatory shifts, market volatility, and changes in U.S.-China relations, all of which could impact these investments.\n\nInvestors should be aware of these factors and may want to consult with a financial adviser to ensure these investments align with their overall financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's cloud unit has introduced its first \"AI programmer\" powered by the company's self-developed large language model (LLM), as the tech giant explores monetisation of the business.\n\nIntroduced by Alibaba Cloud, the AI programmer aims to help developers shorten development time for applications, in some cases down to minutes, the company said in a statement on Friday. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nFunctioning as a \"multi-intelligence agent\", the AI programmer combines the roles of software architect, development engineer, and test engineer to achieve end-to-end product functionality, according to the statement.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"The development paradigm for software applications is changing,\" Xu Dong, general manager of Alibaba Cloud's Tongyi Qianwen LLM service, said at the company's Cloud AI summit in Shanghai on Friday.\n\n\"In the future, users only need to identify problems and express requirements, and completing an application development in minutes will become the norm,\" Xu said.\n\nAlibaba Cloud said the AI programmer could handle tasks such as decomposition, code writing, testing and debugging, deployed all at once through multiple conversations with the user.\n\nDuring a live demonstration at the summit, the AI programmer created an application from scratch within 10 minutes, a process the company said might take half a day using traditional methods.\n\nHuman programmers, however, have expressed mixed feelings about the product. Liang Yan, a developer who has worked in the cryptocurrency industry for four years, said the AI programmer might be a threat.\n\n\"My job is mainly about choosing open source projects and learning from them,\" said Liang. \"It's not only about meeting the requirements, but it's also a way to understand the programme.\"\n\nAlthough the AI programmer may save time in development, it may prevent programmers from understanding what they are doing, according to Liang. It also reduces opportunities for novice programmers, he said.\n\nYang Yi, a developer working for a Chinese Big Tech company who has tried other coding tools similar AI programmer, said these tools are still in an early stage of development.\n\n\"I asked AI to write specific code, but it generated code that was not so reliable, sometimes with grammatical or factual errors,\" Yang said. \"It reduces the workload, but not completely.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe launch of the AI programmer comes seven months after the introduction of Tongyi Lingma, Alibaba Cloud's first AI coding assistant, which is also powered by Tongyi Qianwen.\n\nTrained on open-source code, Tongyi Lingma is able to generate code based on natural language instructions, run unit tests, and debug and optimise code.\n\nThe basic version of Tongyi Lingma is free for individual users, while the corporate version - with additional management features - is available for a monthly fee of 159 yuan (US$22) per person with a minimum of 100 users.\n\nThe newly introduced AI programmer, which targets both individual and corporate developers, is not yet publicly available. Pricing details have not been disclosed, according to the company.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Largest Economies in the World by 2050 and in this article we will take a look at the country that's expected to be the largest in 2050.\n\nGlobal Economic Forecast: Emerging Markets Set to Dominate by 2050\n\nAccording to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by 2050, the global population is anticipated to grow to over 9 billion, which is likely to increase pressure on natural resources essential for energy and food production. You can also take a look at the 25 Biggest Food Companies in the World by Revenue. Despite the recent recession, the world GDP is expected to almost quadruple by 2050. However, GDP growth rates in China and India are predicted to decelerate over the coming decades, whereas the African continent is forecasted to achieve the highest economic growth rate globally between 2030 and 2050. The global energy demand is also forecasted to increase by 80% however, the global energy mix is expected to remain largely unchanged, with fossil fuels still making up around 85%, renewables just over 10%, and the remainder being nuclear energy. To accommodate a growing population with evolving dietary preferences, global agricultural land is projected to expand in the coming decade to meet rising food demand, although this expansion will occur at a decreasing rate. Consequently, intense competition for land resources is expected in the decades ahead. China and India will also face substantial population aging, with China's workforce expected to decrease by 2050. Urban areas are set to accommodate nearly 70% of the world's population projected to reside in cities by then.\n\nAccording to The World in 2050 report by PwC, China is projected to be the world's largest economy by 2050, contributing approximately 20% of global GDP. China has already surpassed the United States to become the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). Moreover, China is expected to emerge as the world's largest economy before 2030, with India becoming the third-largest by 2050. Both China and India are likely to surpass the United States, which is currently the largest economy in the world. The EU's share of the world\u2019s GDP is projected to drop below 10%. The Emerging Seven, or E7, economies are projected to grow almost twice as fast as the advanced G7 economies due to a negative growth of -0.3% per annum on average in the working-age population of the G7 economies between 2016 and 2050. Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh are projected to be among the fastest-growing economies. While Poland is expected to be the fastest-growing EU economy. Although today's advanced economies will maintain higher average incomes, emerging markets are set to narrow the gap significantly by 2050. This shift presents substantial opportunities for businesses willing to invest long-term in these regions, despite recent economic challenges in countries like Brazil, Nigeria, and Turkey, which still hold significant potential. For emerging markets to achieve this growth, governments must implement structural reforms to enhance macroeconomic stability, diversify economies, and strengthen political and legal institutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the Key Companies Driving Growth in Asia\n\nThe long-term economic outlook highlights the potential dominance of Asian countries. One of the biggest companies in Asia, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), has been a key driver of economic growth in the region.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) specializes in e-commerce, logistics, retail, internet, and technology services. The company has over 228,000 employees and has a business presence all around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and various European and Asian nations. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) operates a range of online marketplaces and offers logistic services as well as online payment services. The company also provides comprehensive cloud services and has a significant presence in digital media and entertainment.\n\nOn May 14, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported that its revenue increased by 8% year on year to $267.34 billion. Digital Commerce revenue increased by 45% and order volume grew 20% year over year due to a focus on expanding cross-border retail operations and enhancing the consumer experience. The company\u2019s Public Cloud Offerings revenue increased double-digit whereas AI-related revenue increased triple-digit year over year. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) repurchased 1.25 billion shares for $12.5 billion and outstanding shares decreased by 5.1% in fiscal year 2024.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is also expanding in the luxury retail market. In May, the group announced a partnership with\u00a0 LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (OTC:LVMHF) to enhance the luxury retail experience in China by integrating its Cloud generative AI to create innovative applications and services to enhance its offerings. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (OTC:LVMHF) has successfully introduced around 30 maisons who are using Alibaba's digital capabilities for engaging experiences such as 3D product displays, virtual try-on, and livestreaming. Commenting on the event Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group, said:\n\n\u201cAlibaba is pleased to enable a transformation of the high-end consumption experience with retail leaders like LVMH through our world-class technologies in cloud computing and AI. This comprehensive partnership has elevated the retail experience for LVMH\u2019s customers worldwide, including China-based consumers on Tmall. We look forward to continuing to build on the strong partnership and innovation journey with LVMH.\u201d\n\nThe global economic landscape is going through a significant transformation, driven by the rapid growth of emerging economies and the decline of developed economies. Despite the current economic hurdles emerging markets present opportunities for investment and expansion, with that in context let's look at the 20 largest economies in the world by 2050. The Largest Economy in the World by 2050\n\nAn expansive view of the cityscape, showing the impact of the company's activities in China.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 largest economies in the world by 2050, we consulted 'Economics in the Year 2100' by Fathom. It provides data for the estimated percentage share of countries in the global GDP in 2100. It also reports the GDP PPP of the top ten economies. We utilized the data for the GDP PPP value of the top countries and percentage share to calculate the total global GDP value in 2050. Our calculation yielded that the global GDP is projected to be approximately $224.96 trillion by 2050. After calculating the global GDP in US dollars, we estimated the GDP PPP for the remaining countries to provide insight into their projected values. Our list ranks the 20 largest economies in the world by 2050 in ascending order of their GDP. We also used the population projections for 2050, by the United Nations.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

China has already surpassed the United States to become the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). Moreover, China is expected to emerge as the world's largest economy before 2030, and its population is projected to be 1.31 billion by 2050.\n\nCurious to learn about which other countries will have the largest economies in the world by 2050?

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Goes Bargain Hunting: 6 Stocks He Just Bought",
        "content": "One of the best ways to understand what the \"smart money\" on Wall Street is thinking is by combing through quarterly 13F filings. Large hedge funds must file a 13F every quarter, disclosing which stocks they are buying, holding, and selling.\n\nOne of the best money managers of the past 30 years has been David Tepper of Appaloosa Management. Between 1993 and 2013, Tepper averaged a stunning 40% annualized return, and has had a roughly 23%-25% net historical return from 1993 until today.\n\nNeedless to say, investors may be interested to know which stocks Tepper likes at the moment. With an appetite for both high-quality growth stocks and bargain-priced value stocks, Tepper appears to have swapped one type of stock for the other in the first quarter 2024.\n\nTrimming the Magnificent Seven for the \"Magnificent Seven\" of China\n\nTepper has clearly benefited from a bet on the artificial intelligence wave, with many of his top holdings entering 2024 in leading Magnificent Seven stocks or large-cap semiconductor stocks, with both categories benefiting handsomely from the AI revolution sweeping over corporate America.\n\nBut in the first quarter, Tepper trimmed the vast majority of these leading U.S.-based technology stocks and reinvested the winnings into the Chinese tech sector -- essentially swapping out five U.S. Magnificent Seven stocks for a basket of \"Magnificent Seven-type\" Chinese tech stocks.\n\nAppaloosa's new buys included four stocks, Alibaba, PDD Holdings (formerly Pinduoduo), Baidu, and JD.com, along with two China-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the iShares China Large-Cap ETF and the tech-focused KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF.\n\nCompany % Increase From Prior Quarter % of Appaloosa Portfolio End of Q1 2024 Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) 158.6% 12.05% PDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD) 171% 3.61% Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) 188% 2.81% iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: FXI) New 2.27% JD.com(NASDAQ: JD) New 1.48% KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSEMKT: KWEB) New 1.35%\n\nData source: Whalewisdom.\n\nAs you can see, Tepper has made a really big bet on Alibaba, making it his largest position at this time. But the optimism likely extends to the broader Chinese tech sector and really the entire country's economy. While there is a big bet on tech stocks here, the FXI ETF does contain some state-owned and publicly owned banks as well in its top 10 holdings.\n\nBasically, Tepper and his team may have concluded a long-awaited turnaround for the Chinese economy may be at hand.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's economy may be picking up\n\nChina's economy has really been in a downturn since COVID-19, as the country wouldn't use U.S. vaccines and therefore tried to lock down the country every time there was a new outbreak, disrupting business. Furthermore, the government decided to bring the regulatory hammer down on the country's leading technology companies, limiting their growth and often suggesting or mandating breakups and asset divestitures. Furthermore, China pricked its real estate bubble, causing many large property developers to go bankrupt, leaving many pre-paid housing projects unfinished.\n\nBut in the last year or so, the government seems to have done an about-face, easing the regulatory burden on technology companies while attempting to stimulate its economy and encourage growth. The result has been six straight months of positive growth in China's manufacturing sector, as shown by the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. And perhaps most importantly, Chinese officials have recently contemplated buying unfinished housing projects from bankrupt developers and turning them into affordable housing or rental properties. Healing the property sector would be a key to stabilizing the Chinese economy.

Meanwhile, China's leading tech stocks have fallen to absolute bargain-basement valuations, especially compared with high-flying U.S. tech stocks. PDD Holdings now trades at just 12 times earnings, while Alibaba, JD, and Baidu each trade between 8 and 9 times this year's earnings estimates. BABA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIn light of the cheap valuations and growth picking up, most Chinese tech companies have been streamlining costs and launching large share repurchase programs. Alibaba raised its buyback authorization by $25 billion in the first quarter and repurchased $4.8 billion worth of its stock in Q1, lowering its share count by 2.6% in just one quarter alone. JD.com repurchased $1.2 billion, or 2.8% of its shares, in the first quarter, before authorizing another $3 billion program. And Baidu authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in February, buying back $898 billion of its stock this year as of its first-quarter earnings report.\n\nThus, it's perhaps not surprising to see Tepper trim some of his U.S. AI winners while rebalancing into much cheaper Chinese tech stocks buying back their stock, especially if he and his analysts also believe the Chinese economy will continue to recover.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Billionaire investors are among the most influential market drivers. That\u2019s especially rue in the case of those who have control over massive investment entities. Retail traders only constitute about 20-25% of the total trading volume in the market, so it makes sense to follow these billionaire investors into their big bets. These individuals have unmatched research capacity, and following in their footsteps could help you generate market-beating returns, or at least gain some perspective on certain companies.\n\nThat said, none of these billionaires have a crystal ball. So, I think studying these picks and discussing their recent performance is a smarter idea than blindly following their trades. That is what I\u2019ll be doing today with the following stocks that the top billionaires are betting big on in 2024.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is an integrated energy company engaged in oil and gas exploration and production. Despite a challenging start to the year due to a third-party outage in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, Occidental delivered robust production results in Q1 2024, nearly offsetting the impact of this headwind. I\u2019m particularly impressed by the company\u2019s strong new well performance in the Permian Basin and the Rockies, which helped them exceed the midpoint of their Permian production guidance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company also found success in secondary benches in the Delaware Basin. Occidental is achieving excellent performance in its recent earnings reports, mirroring its record-setting 2023 program average.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s initial investment in Occidental took place back in 2019, and he has consistently added to his position over the past few years. Since then, Buffett has made 12 purchases of OXY, at an average price of $51.70, for a total of 274.21 million shares.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHe now holds almost 29% of all outstanding shares, and he most recently expanded his investment in Occidental Petroleum Corp by acquiring an additional 2,947,611 shares, as reported on June 17. He has bought the stock for nine days straight as of writing.\n\nChevron (CVX) CVX stock\n\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $5.4 billion and return on capital employed (ROCE) above 12% for the 9th straight quarter. I believe Chevron is poised to benefit from the long-term mega trend of rising global energy demand. With its scale and low-cost assets, Chevron looks well-positioned in this current environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise Chevron is a classic Warren Buffett play. But Chevron is attracting big bets from all types of billionaire investors lately. Notably, Ken Fisher increased his Chevron position by a whopping 108% this year. Stocks billionaires are betting on: Ken Fisher CVX holdings\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHess (NYSE:HES) shareholders also approved merging with Chevron.\n\nI think this merger will create a true energy powerhouse, powering even better returns moving forward. And even on a backward-looking basis, there\u2019s a lot to like. This past quarter, Chevron grew production 10% year-over-year and continues to invest in renewable fuels and hydrogen. For those looking for a little big of income, Chevron\u2019s 4.25% dividend yield is also solid.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Zombies and Bears Beware, Alibaba Stock Will Still Defeat You!\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) operates e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital media platforms in China. The tech giant\u2019s latest earnings reveal a company on the cusp of a major turnaround. I believe the stock is poised for significant upside as Alibaba capitalizes on the explosive growth in China\u2019s AI and cloud markets.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper has been making a massive bet on BABA stock, scooping up Alibaba shares at a discount. The stock now comprises a whopping 12.2% of his Appaloosa fund. In Q1 alone, he boosted his stake by nearly 159% to over $814 million. David Tepper Alibaba holdings chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAlibaba\u2019s core commerce business has returned to double-digit growth, with Taobao and Tmall GMV surging. International commerce revenue rose 45% as the company expanded its global footprint. However, the real gem is Alibaba\u2019s AI and cloud business, where revenue soared at a triple-digit rate. As China pours billions into the tech sector, Alibaba is perfectly-positioned to ride this mega trend to new heights.\n\nThe stock is still trading at a steep discount to its highs, so Tepper\u2019s big bet could handsomely pay off in the years ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Chinese Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "China\u2019s economy has undergone an uneven recovery since the country emerged from the global pandemic. Last year, analysts feared the world\u2019s second-largest economy would fall into deflation, similar to Japan\u2019s in the 1990s. While consumer prices in China have generally floated above deflation territory, price growth has generally remained weak. In May, the consumer price index rose a modest 0.3% from the same month in 2023. Declines in the producer price index, which is a broad measure of wholesale prices, also eased. What helped to keep China\u2019s economy afloat has been its strong export sectors, especially electric vehicles. Exports in April and May came well above economists\u2019 expectations.\n\nThat is all to say, China is on the road to recovery despite uneven data, and more government policy stimulus will be needed to get the economy fully back on track. Because of the economic turmoil, Chinese stocks have been underperformers. As they trade at record-low valuations, it may be time to buy up the strong buy Chinese stocks that Wall Street is optimistic about.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nChina\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) landscape showcased the country\u2019s market dynamism. Although it took years for China to get to this point, its EV companies are successfully dominating the EV market. However, no Chinese EV maker has been as successful as BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY). A lithium-ion battery marker turned electric vehicle behemoth, BYD has definitely come a long way.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite all the news about an EV market slump, Chinese EV makers continued to grow their sales and deliveries on a year-over-year basis. For example, at the end of the first quarter, BYD\u2019s sales climbed 46% from the first quarter of 2023 to 301,631. The EV maker\u2019s April and May key performance indicators also came in with similarly robust growth figures. In April, sales increased 48.9% from the same month in 2023, totaling 312,048, and for May, BYD sold 331,817, up 38.1% year-over-year.\n\nStrong growth domestically and abroad has kept BYD\u2019s deliveries and sales figures elevated. A newly announced hybrid vehicle, which can drive 2,000 kilometers on a single charge and boasts a cheap price tag, will be one of the company\u2019s growth catalysts going forward.\n\nOut of the 30 Wall Street firms covering BYD, the Chinese EV maker has been able to garner six \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings from Wall Street firms and 22 \u201cbuy\u201d ratings.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba\u2018s (NYSE:BABA) share price plummeted 51.8% over the past five years. The regulatory crackdown on the technology sector and China\u2019s slow shift from its controversial \u201czero-Covid\u201d policy were just a couple of issues that led to the broad sell-off. Now, China\u2019s uneven economic recovery, which has yet to see consumer confidence rise, has also put a dent in Alibaba\u2019s growth, especially in its e-commerce unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, to kick the firm into high gear, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang announced the company would split into six separate business units, all of which would be capable of an initial public offering. To continue spurring investor confidence, the company has also increased its share buyback program by $25 billion.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, activity increased among the firm\u2019s core e-commerce businesses. Revenue from Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s China e-commerce division, rose 4% from a year ago, higher than the reported growth in the prior quarter.\n\nThere are 44 Wall Street firms covering BABA shares, and seven have given the e-commerce giant a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating, while 30 have rated its shares a \u201cbuy.\u201d\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is another Chinese tech giant whose share price has reeled from politics and a slowing economy. The past five years have seen BIDU shares fall 20.5%, yet Wall Street is feeling more optimistic about the company\u2019s prospects than ever. In particular, Baidu has garnered seven \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings and 24 \u201cbuy\u201d ratings from Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe company runs China\u2019s largest internet search engine business. Baidu\u2019s new growth vertical will be related to artificial intelligence, a technology Baidu has invested millions of dollars into research and development for about a decade. For the first quarter of 2024, Baidu\u2019s earnings results were mixed. The company missed revenue but beat EPS estimates. Additionally, revenue related to Baidu\u2019s AI Cloud unit increased 6% on a year-over-year basis, underscoring the platform\u2019s gaining momentum.\n\nAs Baidu continues to invest and cultivate its AI products, its shares will likely gain in value. Trading at only 8.3x forward earnings, BIDU does look like a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) the Best Undervalued AI Stock?",
        "content": "We recently published a list titled\u00a010 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d. Since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) ranks 8th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s (GWM) recently\u00a0published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI \u201cvalue chain,\u201d estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\n\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers \u2013\u00a0 Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem \u2014 infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,\u00a0 Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\n\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\n\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it\u2019s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers \u2014 think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\n\nKey AI Predictions\n\nThe UBS report also made key \u201cpredictions\u201d about the AI landscape. The firm\u2019s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a \u201ccapex cycle\u201d that could \u201cinflate\u201d the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects \u201cmonolithic players\u201d and \u201cAI foundries\u201d prevailing in the near future.\n\nBased on this report, let\u2019s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) Best AI Stock With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d?\n\nChristopher Penler / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 103\n\nUBS is bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) exposure to AI because of Alibaba Cloud, or Alibaba Cloud, which makes the Chinese company a formidable player in the AI enabling layer. In the intelligence layer, UBS highlighted Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) Qwen large language model, while the Qwen agent makes the company\u2019s presence notable in the application layer.\n\nHowever, uncertainties in China and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) lackluster performance have damaged the sentiment around the stock. While Alibaba Cloud is a significant player in the market, analysts believe enormous growth and advancements of Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft in the public Cloud markets have left Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) behind. Wall Street analysts expect Alibaba earnings to grow at a CAGR of just 1.7% only over the next five years. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) forward PEG ratio is 3.29, which is high when we incorporate the unimpressive earnings growth expectations.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) ecommerce business is also struggling as buyers in China become price-conscious amid a broader slowdown. However, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) bulls believe the stock could rebound if the situation improves in the country, given the company\u2019s massive cash flow position. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) finished fiscal 2024 with a whopping $34.37 billion in cash on hand, with another $36.42 billion in short-term investments.\n\nIn May, Baidu analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) quarterly results that the company was gaining \u201cearly momentum\u201d as it changes its priorities.\n\n\u201cAlibaba is focused on recapturing e-commerce market share in China, and capitalizing on momentum in international commerce and cloud computing building on strong growth in cross-border volumes, and accelerating revenues in public cloud,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nSebastian has an Outperform rating on the stock and an $85 price target.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its\u00a0fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPretty much all of our holdings rose during the quarter. Only one stock declined by more than a couple of percent\u2014Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), which was down 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. This investment continues to be a disappointment. We estimate the shares are trading at around 5X EBITA\u2014a valuation normally reserved for a company with evaporating profits. While it\u2019s true Alibaba is underperforming its peers in the market, the fact is it remains the market leader in its core businesses, and the business is still growing. In the most recent quarter, revenues grew 9% and profits grew 26%.It\u2019s not evaporating.\n\nThe management seems to be making meaningful changes designed to enhance shareholder value, including structural changes to improve profitability and restore its competitive position. It is monetizing non-core assets and making improvements in capital allocation. A lot of good things are happening that are not yet recognized in the share price. There are reasons\u2014primarily geopolitical\u2014for this, but at the current valuation, we could easily see the shares double and they would still be cheap.\u201d\n\nOverall, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d. While we acknowledge the potential of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 20, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, HSBC Holdings plc HSBC and PrimeEnergy Resources Corp. PNRG.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Qualcomm, Alibaba and HBSC\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Qualcomm Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and HSBC Holdings plc, as well a micro-cap stock PrimeEnergy Resources Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nQualcomm's shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+86.6% vs. +24.1%). The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. This augurs well for the long-term growth.\r\n\r\nQualcomm is benefiting from healthy traction in Android handsets and automotive businesses, with the development of Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows in collaboration with Microsoft likely boosting its commercial prospects in the AI PC market. The Snapdragon X Series Platform integrated with Qualcomm AI Hub is also witnessing significant market traction among leading global PC manufacturers.\r\n\r\nHowever, inventory corrections by clients are impeding sales in the IoT business. Increasing competition in the mobile phone chipset market is likely to strain margin. Rising geopolitical instability and high debt obligation remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Qualcomm here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alibaba have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (-3.9% vs. +15.0%). The company's rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Alibaba is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC's retail businesses and strength in AliExpress' Choice are contributing well. Growing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind.\r\n\r\nExpanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth. Strength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba's international business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of HSBC have gained +12.1% over the past year against the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry's gain of +24.1%. The company's strong capital position, higher interest rates, an extensive network and business restructuring initiatives will keep aiding it.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has exited retail operations in the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Greece and Russia. Moreover, in order to focus more on Asia, HSBC completed the acquisition of Citigroup's wealth business in China.\r\n\r\nHowever, HSBC's first-quarter 2024 results were hurt by higher expenses. While the company's efforts to improve market share in the Asia region will support financials in the long run, this will likely lead to a rise in near-term expenses.\r\n\r\nBecause of its growth strategy and higher technology-related expenses, HSBC expects 2024 expense growth of 5%. The current tough macroeconomic backdrop is another major headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\r\n\r\nPrimeEnergy's shares have gained +18.4% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry's gain of +24.1%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $184.75 million exhibits strong buy indicators, doubling production year over year in first-quarter 2024, with oil rising 123% year over year and gas growing 44%, boosted by effective drilling and new wells.\r\n\r\nRevenues soared 88% year over year to $42.99 million, fueled by high oil prices and production increases. Strategic asset acquisitions expanded PNRG's operational footprint and diversified its revenue streams. The company plans to complete 54 horizontal wells in 2024, investing $140 million, promising growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, liquidity concerns arise with cash reserves dropping to $1.8 million and increasing long-term debt sequentially. Heavy reliance on high-capital horizontal drilling and oil price vulnerability pose significant risks. Technological lags and the shift toward renewable energies may further challenge PNRG's market position.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PrimeEnergy here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Southeast Asian online shopping giant Lazada Group has refuted a report that parent company Alibaba Group Holding is planning to sell its Thailand unit, as China's largest e-commerce conglomerate eyes overseas expansion amid a domestic economic slowdown.\n\n\"Lazada Group is not considering any divestment of our business in Thailand and is not in discussion with any investors on this topic,\" the company said in a statement. \"Any rumours stating otherwise are untrue.\"\n\nThe Bangkok Post on Thursday reported that Alibaba had been in talks with local conglomerates to sell its stake in the Thailand operations, citing anonymous sources.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nLazada started in Singapore in 2012 and by 2016 claimed to be the largest e-commerce firm in Southeast Asia. Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, bought a controlling stake in the company that year.\n\nAlibaba has continued to pump fresh capital into Lazada over the years, including two sizeable investments last year: US$845 in July and US$634 million in December. Alibaba invested another US$230 million in May this year, according to Crunchbase data. It has to date spent a total of US$7.4 billion on the Southeast Asian digital retailer.\n\nLazada now sits under Alibaba's International Digital Commerce Group, one of the Hangzhou-based tech giant's six major business groups set up during an organisational overhaul in March 2023.\n\nThe international group - which also consists of AliExpress, Trendyol and Daraz - recorded a 60 per cent year-on-year revenue increase in the financial year ended March. In its annual report, Alibaba attributed the rise mainly to growth in AliExpress, its international business-to-consumer platform, and Trendyol, a Turkey-based e-commerce platform.\n\nThe unit's 2024 first-quarter revenue increased another 45 per cent year on year, the company said.\n\nLazada also managed to narrow losses per order in the last financial year owing to increased monetisation and lower logistics costs, according to Alibaba.\n\nThe last financial year was Alibaba's most profitable since 2021, with net income increasing 10 per cent to 79.7 billion yuan (US$11 billion) and revenue growing by 8 per cent to 941.2 billion yuan.\n\nAlibaba has been scrambling over the past year to respond to rising competition from budget online retailer PDD Holdings, owner of Pinduoduo and Temu. The tech giant touted some impressive growth trends for the latest 618 shopping festival this week, but again declined to reveal total gross merchandise value figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s shoppers are getting wooed this week like never before.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCar Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Hedge Fund Talent Schools Are Looking for the Perfect Trader Nvidia\u2019s 591,078% Rally to Most Valuable Stock Came in Waves \u2018I Live in Hell\u2019: Anti-Growth Fervor Grips US South After Pandemic Boom\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest internet firms are pulling out all the stops during the annual \u201c618\u201d shopping festival, in a bid to shake off the industry\u2019s post-Covid malaise and return to something like the rah-rah years before 2020. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is offering 50% off Lululemon apparel, while rivals like ByteDance Ltd. and PDD Holdings Inc. advertise steeper-than-ever discounts.\n\nPrice cuts are just the start. Companies are enlisting A-list celebrities to flog products over live video and promising no-questions-asked returns. Before taking on her duties as the new face of J\u2019Adore fragrance, Rihanna found time to rustle up \u201cjianbing\u201d crepes on one Chinese platform. JD.com Inc. even created a digital avatar of founder Richard Liu to hawk steak and blueberries.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s 618 is the most cutthroat shopping festival ever,\u201d Sherri He, managing director at Kearney China, said. \u201cEcommerce platforms are under huge performance pressure amid a consumption downgrade.\u201d\n\nJD.com shares fell by 2.3% in Hong Kong on Thursday, their most in two weeks, while Alibaba was down about 1% and Kuaishou Technology dropped as much as 6.5%.\n\nThis year\u2019s 618 gala \u2014 a $100 billion extravaganza several times larger than a typical Black Friday \u2014 is more closely watched than ever. From incumbent leader Alibaba to upstarts such as Bilibili and ByteDance\u2019s Douyin, the aggressive discounts and unprecedented marketing underscore an urgency to rekindle growth.\n\nEveryone in the ecosystem is feeling the pressure. For investors, 618 represents the first large-scale test in 2024 of whether the Chinese consumer is finally ready to splurge again \u2014 or to what extent a property crisis, stubborn deflation and uncertain job prospects are discouraging spending. When all\u2019s said and done, how Alibaba and JD perform may be key to reviving share prices that are at about a quarter of their 2020 highs.\n\n\u201cThe market is hungry for data points that prove or disprove the consumption recovery story in China,\u201d said Vey-Sern Ling, a managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. \u201c618 this year is important, because this year more than before, investors are trying to spot the inflection.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe major platforms are not expected to release full sales figures, but initial and independent estimates paint a mixed picture. Overall sales from Alibaba, JD.com, Douyin, PDD, and Kuaishou likely rose 10% from the year before during the 618 event, according to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. Yet early strength in the festival may have shrunk in its final two weeks, they added.\n\nJD.com said it racked up record gross merchandise value. Alibaba said its platform saw more than 36,000 brands, including Burberry and Ralph Lauren, double their GMV from last year\u2019s event, though it didn\u2019t divulge overall figures.\n\nTotal sales across ecommerce platforms were down 7% from the previous year, at 742.8 billion yuan ($102 billion), according to market tracker Syntun. That\u2019s in contrast to data from Analysys, which found short-video platforms led growth over the first two weeks of the festival: Douyin grew sales by 30% and Kuaishou improved by 18%, outpacing Alibaba\u2019s 15% and JD.com\u2019s 9.5% growth, according to that research.\n\nAn increase in no-quibble returns may help account for some of the discrepancy. Some luxury brands reported return or cancellation rates as high as 75% during last November\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day festival, far higher than the industry norm. And they\u2019ve slashed prices this year by as much as 50% in a growing panic over unsold inventory.\n\nWhile 618 is key to all ecommerce firms, it\u2019s the first time that Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu is spearheading the gala. Wu, who took over from Daniel Zhang in September, is trying to refocus Alibaba on its core online retail strengths and escape a years-long cycle of mostly single-digit growth.\n\nWith Wu at the helm, Alibaba has spent heavily in particular on livestreaming \u2014 the fastest-growing segment of ecommerce, but also one where ByteDance, JD and Kuaishou are increasingly investing. More than 10% of China\u2019s retail purchases last year came via influencer streams, according to data from iResearch and national statistics.\n\n\u201cA re-acceleration of topline growth for Alibaba\u2019s core ecommerce should be well received by the market,\u201d said Xiadong Bao, fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. \u201cBut we will gauge the quality of that growth, down to the margin and sustainability, as the investors see Alibaba more as a value stock than a growth one now.\u201d\n\nJD.com has pledged a billion yuan to support livestreaming sellers, even as Alibaba promised billions in cash rewards and experimented with novel approaches such as a streaming section exclusively for company CEOs.\n\nBut there are signs that consumers are tiring of buying from influencers and online pitch-people. Key influencers during the 618 festival lost steam, in part from stricter content regulations, rising costs, and higher return rates, analysts from HSBC said in a research note. That could offer a boost to traditional retailers like Alibaba in regaining market share, they said.\n\nJiajia, a Hangzhou-based streamer who promotes beauty and clothing brands for WPIC Marketing + Technologies, also finds it tougher. Her team analyzes minute-by-minute traffic data to understand how to best capture attention and drive sales.\n\n\u201cWhen ecommerce was still in its early days, people bought things more easily,\u201d Jiajia said. \u201cNowadays, everyone is more rational and clear about what they want to buy.\u201d\n\nThe big platforms also turned to more traditional avenues: faster delivery times, automatic coupon collection, delivery fee insurance and lowest-price guarantees. For the first time, JD.com and Alibaba introduced a price-matching promise after purchase \u2014 so shoppers get refunded the difference should a product get cheaper after they buy it.\n\nThat barrage of incentives may still fall short, given the fundamental fact of a volatile economy. At one point before Covid, 618 and Singles\u2019 Day \u2014 its Nov. 11 counterpart \u2014 had evolved into online phenomena, almost a communal shopping event where people proudly posted their biggest finds on social media. Even Taylor Swift got involved once.\n\nCovid-era shocks have largely deflated that enthusiasm, while heavy discounting has also alienated merchants. More than 50 book publishers in Beijing and Shanghai refused to join JD.com\u2019s 618 promotion, which required as much as 80% discounts. Other merchants have quit 618 altogether as discounts mounted over the past years, Kearney China\u2019s He said.\n\nIn recent years, slower growth has seen the ecommerce incumbents report selective figures in lieu of overall GMV numbers. In 2022, when JD.com last reported its overall sales for the festival \u2014 379 billion yuan \u2014 that accounted for more than 10% of its total GMV for the year.\n\n\u201cThe mood music is still lower pricing and best value,\u201d said David Hampstead, CEO of Samarkand Global, which helps western brands sell to Chinese consumers. \u201cBut there\u2019s only so far you can push brands before China becomes too expensive or not profitable enough to play in. It\u2019s reaching that point.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang, Zheping Huang and Peter Elstrom.\n\n(Updates with analyst estimates and share price reaction)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

JD.com Inc. even created a digital avatar of founder Richard Liu to hawk steak and blueberries.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s 618 is the most cutthroat shopping festival ever,\u201d Sherri He, managing director at Kearney China, said. \u201cEcommerce platforms are under huge performance pressure amid a consumption downgrade.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s 618 gala \u2014 a $100 billion extravaganza several times larger than a typical Black Friday \u2014 is more closely watched than ever. From incumbent leader Alibaba to upstarts such as Bilibili and ByteDance\u2019s Douyin, the aggressive discounts and unprecedented marketing underscore an urgency to rekindle growth.\n\nEveryone in the ecosystem is feeling the pressure. For investors, 618 represents the first large-scale test in 2024 of whether the Chinese consumer is finally ready to splurge again \u2014 or to what extent a property crisis, stubborn deflation and uncertain job prospects are discouraging spending. When all\u2019s said and done, how Alibaba and JD perform may be key to reviving share prices that are at about a quarter of their 2020 highs.\n\n\u201cThe market is hungry for data points that prove or disprove the consumption recovery story in China,\u201d said Vey-Sern Ling, a managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. \u201c618 this year is important, because this year more than before, investors are trying to spot the inflection.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the companies might release final results \u2014 or how comprehensive they would be. Initial and independent estimates paint a mixed picture.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD.com said it racked up record gross merchandise value. Alibaba said its platform saw more than 36,000 brands, including Burberry and Ralph Lauren, double their GMV from last year\u2019s event, though it didn\u2019t divulge overall figures.\n\nTotal sales across ecommerce platforms were down 7% from the previous year, at 742.8 billion yuan ($102 billion), according to market tracker Syntun. That\u2019s in contrast to data from Analysys, which found short-video platforms led growth over the first two weeks of the festival: Douyin grew sales by 30% and Kuaishou Technology improved by 18%, outpacing Alibaba\u2019s 15% and JD.com\u2019s 9.5% growth, according to that research.\n\nAn increase in no-quibble returns may help account for some of the discrepancy. Some luxury brands reported return or cancellation rates as high as 75% during last November\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day festival, far higher than the industry norm. And they\u2019ve slashed prices this year by as much as 50% in a growing panic over unsold inventory.\n\nWhile 618 is key to all ecommerce firms, it\u2019s the first time that Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu is spearheading the gala. Wu, who took over from Daniel Zhang in September, is trying to refocus Alibaba on its core online retail strengths and escape a years-long cycle of mostly single-digit growth.\n\nWith Wu at the helm, Alibaba has spent heavily in particular on livestreaming \u2014 the fastest-growing segment of ecommerce, but also one where ByteDance, JD and Kuaishou are increasingly investing. More than 10% of China\u2019s retail purchases last year came via influencer streams, according to data from iResearch and national statistics.\n\n\u201cA re-acceleration of topline growth for Alibaba\u2019s core ecommerce should be well received by the market,\u201d said Xiadong Bao, fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. \u201cBut we will gauge the quality of that growth, down to the margin and sustainability, as the investors see Alibaba more as a value stock than a growth one now.\u201d\n\nJD.com has pledged a billion yuan to support livestreaming sellers, even as Alibaba promised billions in cash rewards and experimented with novel approaches such as a streaming section exclusively for company CEOs.\n\nBut there are signs that consumers are tiring of buying from influencers and online pitch-people.\n\nJiajia, a Hangzhou-based streamer who promotes beauty and clothing brands for WPIC Marketing + Technologies, also finds it tougher. Her team analyzes minute-by-minute traffic data to understand how to best capture attention and drive sales.\n\n\u201cWhen ecommerce was still in its early days, people bought things more easily,\u201d Jiajia said. \u201cNowadays, everyone is more rational and clear about what they want to buy.\u201d\n\nThe big platforms also turned to more traditional avenues: faster delivery times, automatic coupon collection, delivery fee insurance and lowest-price guarantees. For the first time, JD.com and Alibaba introduced a price-matching promise after purchase \u2014 so shoppers get refunded the difference should a product get cheaper after they buy it.\n\nThat barrage of incentives may still fall short, given the fundamental fact of a volatile economy. At one point before Covid, 618 and Singles\u2019 Day \u2014 its Nov. 11 counterpart \u2014 had evolved into online phenomena, almost a communal shopping event where people proudly posted their biggest finds on social media. Even Taylor Swift got involved once.\n\nCovid-era shocks have largely deflated that enthusiasm, while heavy discounting has also alienated merchants. More than 50 book publishers in Beijing and Shanghai refused to join JD.com\u2019s 618 promotion, which required as much as 80% discounts. Other merchants have quit 618 altogether as discounts mounted over the past years, Kearney China\u2019s He said.\n\nIn recent years, slower growth has seen the ecommerce incumbents report selective figures in lieu of overall GMV numbers. In 2022, when JD.com last reported its overall sales for the festival \u2014 379 billion yuan \u2014 that accounted for more than 10% of its total GMV for the year.\n\n\u201cThe mood music is still lower pricing and best value,\u201d said David Hampstead, CEO of Samarkand Global, which helps western brands sell to Chinese consumers. \u201cBut there\u2019s only so far you can push brands before China becomes too expensive or not profitable enough to play in. It\u2019s reaching that point.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang, Zheping Huang and Peter Elstrom.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding and JD.com touted impressive growth trends but declined to reveal total gross merchandise value (GMV) figures for their midyear 618 shopping festival events, as China's major e-commerce players remain locked in a heated battle to get consumers to open their wallets amid the country's economic slowdown.\n\nBoth e-commerce giants declared victory as they fend off competition from rivals Pinduoduo, operated by Temu owner PDD Holdings, and Douyin, the Chinese equivalent of TikTok owned by ByteDance, but some analysts warn that consumers are growing weary of the non-stop online promotions.\n\nAs of midnight Tuesday, a total of 365 brands on Tmall surpassed 100 million yuan (US$13.8 million) in GMV, while over 36,000 brands had doubled their GMV, according to data from Taobao and Tmall Group, the domestic e-commerce unit of Alibaba Group Holding, which also owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Reuters>\n\nMeanwhile, JD.com, a major rival of Alibaba, said on Wednesday that its transaction volume and orders during the midyear sales extravaganza broke records, without disclosing the exact figures.\n\nJD.com said 500 million customers took part in its sales promotion, with orders contributing to over 1 billion yuan in sales across 83 brands, representing 50 per cent sales growth for more than 150,000 small and medium-sized merchants.\n\nSome of the biggest sales numbers came from campaigns to offer competitively priced items, such as JD.com's \"10-Billion-Yuan Discount\" promotion, which saw 150 per cent year-on-year growth during from May 31 to June 18.\n\nSimilarly, Taobao and Tmall said its \"Taobao RMB10 Billion Subsidy Programme\", a dedicated sales channel meant to offer higher-quality products at competitive prices, became a new growth engine for brands. Total GMV generated from this channel increased 550 per cent year on year as of midnight Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe record numbers for an event that has been held annually for over a decade proves that e-commerce campaigns still have a significant effect on stimulating consumption, according to Zhuang Shuai, founder and chief analyst at market consultancy Bailian. \"Consumer confidence has been rising, although it's also becoming more rational and sensible,\" Zhuang said. \"A mature consumer market will inevitably bring more challenges to e-commerce sales campaigns.\"\n\nThe 618 shopping event this year saw e-commerce players adopt various measures to attract consumers in the highly competitive market, including cancelling the traditional presale stage which had allowed consumers to pay a deposit on goods to guarantee a low price during the actual sales period.\n\nThe effect of cancelling presales \"surpassed our expectations\", proving that \"direct sales at large events can have strong growth\", a spokesperson from Taobao and Tmall Group said on Tuesday.\n\nAn ad for JD.com's 618 shopping event seen in a subway station in Shanghai, China, June 12, 2023.

        "title": "More worries for China, sales at big e-commerce festival drop for first time",
        "content": "By Casey Hall and Sophie Yu\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's mid-year e-commerce sales festival failed to stir up a great deal of excitement among shoppers, industry experts said, even as major platforms extended offers to a weeks-long period to woo belt-tightening consumers amid a gloomy economic outlook.\n\nThe 618 festival, named after the June 18 founding date of e-commerce provider JD.com, but embraced by all platforms, is China's second-biggest annual sales event after Singles Day in November and a key test of household consumption appetite.\n\nA weak sales performance during the festival would indicate further challenges facing the world's second-biggest economy, which is already grappling with a prolonged property crisis and high unemployment.\n\n\"With discounts available year-round, buzz around 618 has diminished,\" said Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies.\n\n\"But the festival is still generating a GMV bump from baseline and overall GMV should be up slightly from 2023,\" he said, referring to gross merchandise volume, a widely used proxy for e-commerce firms' online sales.\n\nJD.com said on Wednesday its turnover and order volumes reached a new high over the festival period, which ran from the end of May to June 18 this year. It did not elaborate on the exact growth rate of its orders or sales during the festival, which was first launched in 2010 as just a one-day sale.\n\nData from consultancy Syntun last year showed the combined GMV on major e-commerce platforms for the 618 festival period totalled 614.3 billion yuan ($85.79 billion), up 5.4% from 2022. A similar level of growth is broadly expected by analysts this year.\n\nMajor players such as JD.com and Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao platforms this year cancelled a traditional pre-sale period in which shoppers could place deposits on products and complete the purchase during a later sales period. Instead, the sales period itself was extended.\n\nThat extension, combined with China's broader consumer belt tightening, which is pushing retailers to constantly focus on low prices, also contributed to 618 garnering less enthusiasm than the event once enjoyed, analysts said.\n\nAn analysis by consultancy Re-Hub of luxury brand discounting strategies during this year's 618 festival found nearly half of the brands they tracked either maintained or reduced their average discounts from the previous year, while 20% increased their average discounts.\n\nHOME APPLIANCES AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS\n\nAlibaba had previously flagged in a mid-618 season update that sectors such as home appliances were outperforming on its platforms, led by brands such as Haier and Xiaomi.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe e-commerce giant said on Wednesday that international brands including Nike, L'Oreal, Lancome and Adidas surpassed 1 billion yuan ($137.82 million) of sales on Tmall during the period.\n\nApple offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models via its Tmall flagship store in a bid to keep pace with domestic competitor Huawei.\n\nWithin the first hours of sales, Alibaba said Apple had sold more than 200 million yuan of merchandise.\n\nRival PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo, which does not traditionally disclose 618 sales data, did not respond immediately to a request for information.\n\nGiven low prices are now such a common feature of China's consumer landscape, it is becoming more difficult for e-commerce platforms to keep customers engaged - even with traditionally successful sales festivals.\n\n\"I haven't been paying constant attention to 618, to be honest, because there are just so many (shopping festivals),\" said Anita Meng, a university student from Hangzhou.\n\n\"Even if these festivals are still going strong, my wallet is already exhausted,\" she said, adding she only made one purchase this 618 - a gaming chair for her older brother that was reduced from more than 1,200 yuan to 1,000 yuan ($138).\n\n($1 = 7.2559 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Casey Hall in Shanghai and Sophie Yu in Beijing; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tuesday, June 18, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC), as well a micro-cap stock PrimeEnergy Resources Corporation (PNRG).\u00a0 The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nQualcomm\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+86.6% vs. +24.1%). The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. This augurs well for the long-term growth.\r\n\r\nQualcomm is benefiting from healthy traction in Android handsets and automotive businesses, with the development of Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows in collaboration with Microsoft likely boosting its commercial prospects in the AI PC market. The Snapdragon X Series Platform integrated with Qualcomm AI Hub is also witnessing significant market traction among leading global PC manufacturers.\r\n\r\nHowever, inventory corrections by clients are impeding sales in the IoT business. Increasing competition in the mobile phone chipset market is likely to strain margin. Rising geopolitical instability and high debt obligation remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Qualcomm here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alibaba have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (-3.9% vs. +15.0%). The company\u2019s rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Alibaba is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses and strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice are contributing well. Growing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind.\r\n\r\nExpanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth. Strength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba\u2019s international business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of HSBC have gained +12.1% over the past year against the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry\u2019s gain of +24.1%. The company\u2019s strong capital position, higher interest rates, an extensive network and business restructuring initiatives will keep aiding it.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has exited retail operations in the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Greece and Russia. Moreover, in order to focus more on Asia, HSBC completed the acquisition of Citigroup\u2019s wealth business in China.\r\n\r\nHowever, HSBC\u2019s first-quarter 2024 results were hurt by higher expenses. While the company\u2019s efforts to improve market share in the Asia region will support financials in the long run, this will likely lead to a rise in near-term expenses.\r\n\r\nBecause of its growth strategy and higher technology-related expenses, HSBC expects 2024 expense growth of 5%. The current tough macroeconomic backdrop is another major headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\r\n\r\nPrimeEnergy\u2019s shares have gained +18.4% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry\u2019s gain of +24.1%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $184.75 million exhibits strong buy indicators, doubling production year over year in first-quarter 2024, with oil rising 123% year over year and gas growing 44%, boosted by effective drilling and new wells.\r\n\r\nRevenues soared 88% year over year to $42.99 million, fueled by high oil prices and production increases. Strategic asset acquisitions expanded PNRG's operational footprint and diversified its revenue streams. The company plans to complete 54 horizontal wells in 2024, investing $140 million, promising growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, liquidity concerns arise with cash reserves dropping to $1.8 million and increasing long-term debt sequentially. Heavy reliance on high-capital horizontal drilling and oil price vulnerability pose significant risks. Technological lags and the shift toward renewable energies may further challenge PNRG's market position.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PrimeEnergy here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Virtu Financial, Inc.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Alibaba (BABA) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alibaba (BABA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.35, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.35 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy, representing 82.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for BABA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for BABA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alibaba, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in BABA?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.20.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alibaba.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Chinese technology brands from Alibaba Group Holding to BYD make up a third of Euro 2024 football tournament's 13 worldwide sponsors, an example of their growing global footprint and commitment to expanding in overseas markets.\n\nThe Chinese sponsors include television and home appliance manufacturer Hisense, Alibaba's global shopping platform AliExpress, financial technology giant Ant Group, smartphone maker Vivo, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nWith many Chinese companies looking abroad amid slow domestic growth, investing heavily in publicity in major global sporting events has become a key strategy.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nE-commerce giant PDD Holdings' international shopping app Temu spent tens of millions of dollars on a marketing campaign during last year's Super Bowl, the annual championship of the US National Football League, resulting in a spike in web searches for its name.\n\n\"They focus on future international expansion, using their foundation and capital strengths in China to boost overseas market presence and revenues, particularly in Europe,\" said Howard Yu, professor at the International Institute for Management Development.\n\n\"What's new and interesting here is that Chinese companies, for the first time, will need to engage the Western market and learn to localise, [changing] their image from being Chinese companies with an international presence to becoming companies that consumers will associate with strong local relevance.\"\n\nChinese brands are doing more than just advertising on the football pitch.\n\nAnt's cross-border payment service Alipay+ has launched a Euro 2024 ticket giveaway. AliExpress, which signed an advertising deal with football star David Beckham, is hosting its summer sales during the tournament.\n\nHisense is providing technical support for the video assistant referee system used in matches, while BYD has replaced host Germany's home-grown car giant Volkswagen as the event's official vehicle supplier.\n\nThe European Championship is expected to draw a cumulative global audience of more than 5 billion, according to the marketing director of the Union of European Football Associations. Other global sponsors of the event include Adidas, Booking.com, Coca-Cola and Qatar Airways.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustria and France faced off on Monday, in front of a BYD advertisement.

Vivo controlled 8 per cent of the global smartphone market as of March, ranking it among the top five, according to data provider Statista.\n\nBYD, which temporarily surpassed Tesla as the world's largest producer of EVs in the fourth quarter, grew its global car sales last year by 62 per cent to 3.02 million units. The Shenzhen-based company is operating or building factories in places such as Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia, Hungary and Uzbekistan.\n\nMeanwhile, Ant in March restructured its operations into three independently-run business units that include overseas unit Ant International, headed by the group's chairman and chief executive Eric Jing Xiandong.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "PDD, AMZN, MELI: Which E-Commerce Stock Is the Strongest Buy?",
        "content": "In recent years, the e-commerce scene has battled macro headwinds and rapidly changing consumer behavior. Undoubtedly, high rates and fears of anything worse than an economic soft landing have caused some consumers to cut back not just on discretionary goods but also on necessities by opting for the cheapest alternatives where possible.\n\nWith one rate cut likely in store in the second and economic growth that could pick up speed (perhaps via a productivity boost from AI), the consumer has reasons to be more hopeful. Whether it\u2019s enough to take e-shopping sprees into overdrive, though, remains to be seen. Regardless, given that most discretionaries are better bought online these days, I\u2019d argue the following e-tailers\u2014PDD, AMZN, MELI\u2014 seem best equipped to power back.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to check in with a trio of e-commerce titans that analysts have rated as Strong Buys.\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD)\n\nPDD Holdings (formerly Pinduoduo) is a Chinese e-tailer that\u2019s been riding high on its international e-commerce business Temu. Even if you\u2019ve never shopped on Temu, you\u2019re probably familiar with the platform and the ad that lets you \u201cshop like a billionaire,\u201d whereby you can shop freely without worrying too much about price. With obscenely low prices on a wide selection of goods, which come straight from the source, Temu seems to be winning the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in terms of pricing for digital retailers.\n\nWith hard-to-match prices, a unique, \u201cgamified\u201d shopping experience that\u2019s uniquely Chinese, and a world of growth opportunities, Temu stands out as the new e-commerce disruptor. All things considered, I remain bullish on PDD stock as it looks to extend its glorious two-year run that saw shares gain almost 150%.\n\nThanks to Temu, PDD has been able to one-up Chinese e-tailer Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) to become China\u2019s largest e-commerce firm by market cap. With Alibaba in a horrid multi-year slump and Temu continuing to soar in popularity, the lead is likely PDD to keep for the long haul.\n\nIn the first quarter, Temu helped power PDD to 131% year-over-year sales growth. That\u2019s the kind of growth that makes the added risks from investing in Chinese stocks forgivable. Nowhere else on Earth can you find that kind of growth for 19.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) or around 13 times forward P/E.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more remarkable is the user growth, with nearly 30 million global Temu app downloads as of February 2024. Clearly, the ads seem to be working. But the big question is if PDD can keep new customers continue \u201cshopping like billionaires\u201d for the long haul. I think they can with its rock-bottom prices amid inflation and the engaging \u201cgamification\u201d of the platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for PDD Stock?\n\nPDD stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average PDD stock price target of $217.75 implies 46.9% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nIf you want rock-bottom prices on goods, you head on over to Temu, but you\u2019ll have to wait a long time for the delivery to arrive on your doorstep. Indeed, if you\u2019re in the U.S., it could take weeks before your Temu order finally arrives. If time is of the essence and speed is what you need, you\u2019ll probably want to take your business over to Amazon. The prices aren\u2019t unreasonable on Amazon, but they are far from being the absolute cheapest for any given product category. I guess that\u2019s the price you pay for blazing delivery speed.\n\nEven if Temu can reduce delivery times by a few days or so, it will probably never come close to matching the speed of Amazon Prime deliveries. Indeed, a profound amount of logistical innovation is going on behind the scenes to make same-day shipping possible. Given this, I\u2019m staying bullish on AMZN stock.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is home to many authentic brand-name goods, many of which you can\u2019t find over at Temu. In that regard, I don\u2019t view Temu as a massive threat to Amazon\u2019s e-commerce moat. That said, Amazon could lose some business to Temu in this environment, where consumers are price-sensitive and willing to wait weeks to get their product.\n\nThe good news for AMZN stockholders is that Temu and its fashionable Chinese e-commerce peer Shein have the attention of the Seattle-based e-commerce titan. Reportedly, Amazon drastically decreased fees for cheap clothing (articles going for under $20), a move that should help it hit back at fast-moving Chinese e-tailers as they look to disrupt the original disruptor in e-commerce.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of AMZN Stock?\n\nAMZN stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 42 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average AMZN stock price target of $221.20 implies 20.2% upside potential.\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI)\n\nMercadoLibre is an e-commerce and payments firm that serves Latin America. It\u2019s pretty much the Amazon for Latin American nations\u2014like Brazil, where the actual Amazon rainforest is located. Serving emerging markets can entail significant long-term growth potential, making MercadoLibre an e-commerce play for those who seek growth above all else. With a robust growth narrative and a dominant position in its circle of competence, I\u2019m staying bullish on the stock despite its frothy multiple.\n\nAt writing, MELI stock goes for more than 70.9 times trailing P/E, which makes AMZN (51.6 times trailing P/E at writing) and PDD (19.7 times) look like relative bargains. That said, having a dominant position in higher-growth markets does entail a greater premium. Given PDD\u2019s international presence with Temu, however, I\u2019d argue PDD stock is, by far, a better option for value-conscious growth investors.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts envision 2024 sales hitting $19 billion, up 25% year-over-year. With a similar growth playbook as a younger Amazon in markets that have far more growth potential, MELI stock seems like a name to watch or even buy on a pullback.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of MELI Stock?\n\nMELI stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average MELI stock price target of $1,921.82 implies 23.3% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe e-commerce market looks primed for performance as the economy rises from an inflationary environment full of macro headwinds. Believe it or not, Amazon isn\u2019t the growthiest pick of the pack these days when you expand your horizons to encompass some of the international e-tailers. Of the trio, analysts like PDD stock the most.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) closed the latest trading day at $74.55, indicating a +1.64% change from the previous session's end. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.77%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.49%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.95%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the online retailer had lost 17.16% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 0.04%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.71%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alibaba in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Alibaba to post earnings of $2.24 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 6.67%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $34.95 billion, showing an 8.22% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $8.20 per share and a revenue of $138.63 billion, signifying shifts of -4.87% and +6.23%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Alibaba. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.21% higher. Alibaba is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Alibaba is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.95. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 19.58 for its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, BABA's PEG ratio is currently 0.38. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Internet - Commerce was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.94 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 83, placing it within the top 33% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups.

        "title": "These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Carvana (CVNA) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.07 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 17, 2024.\n\nCarvana's Earnings ESP sits at 367.64%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.07 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.02.\n\nCVNA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Alibaba (BABA) as well.\n\nAlibaba is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 8, 2024. BABA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.37 a share 52 days from its next earnings release.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alibaba is $2.24, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 5.74%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CVNA and BABA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "3 Emerging Market Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off",
        "content": "Emerging market stocks to buy offer access to fast-growing economies and global growth drivers. Emerging economies are projected to grow over 4% this year, compared to just 2% for developed economies. This growth, combined with attractive valuations, underscores the potential for portfolio diversification in emerging markets.\n\nHowever, one key concern is how moves in foreign exchange rates could impact investment returns. For U.S.-based investors, a potential decline in the U.S. dollar (USD) typically benefits emerging market exchange-traded stocks. Thus, with the recent slight weakening of the dollar and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, these markets present an opportune investment landscape.\n\nSo, let\u2019s explore three top emerging market stocks to buy in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on our list of emerging market stocks to buy is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). The Chinese e-commerce giant operates various online platforms and services, positioning itself as a dominant force in China\u2019s digital economy, ripe with growth potential.\n\nIn mid-May, Alibaba posted its fourth quarter fiscal 2024 results. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year (YOY). However, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) declined 5% from the prior year, due to higher operational expenses from new initiatives and macroeconomic challenges. Nevertheless, Alibaba still returned money to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.\n\nBeyond capitalizing on China\u2019s growth and global expansion, Alibaba prioritizes advancing its technological prowess, specifically in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Its recent collaboration with the high-end retailerLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy (OTCMKTS:LVMHF) aims to elevate China\u2019s luxury shopping experience by leveraging Alibaba\u2019s cloud technologies and AI for personalized customer interactions. Furthermore, China\u2019s proposed regulations to bolster overseas warehouse construction and augment cross-border e-commerce present promising avenues for additional growth.\n\nIn addition to a modest gain of 1% year-to-date (YTD), BABA stock offers a 1.3% dividend yield. The shares trade at attractive valuations of 9.5 times forward earnings and 1.5 times sales. Analysts hold optimistic forecasts with a 12-month median price target of $106, suggesting a 35% upside potential.\n\nInfosys (INFY) The regional office of Infosys (INFY) in Karnataka, India.\n\nSource: AjayTvm / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up on today\u2019s list of emerging market stocks to buy is the India-headquartered digital services and consulting heavyweight Infosys (NYSE:INFY). The global company provides a wide array of services, including consulting, technology, outsourcing, and next-generation digital solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn April, Infosys unveiled its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results, reporting flat quarterly revenue growth at $4.6 billion. Earnings per diluted share were 23 cents, up 28.8% YOY.\u00a0For fiscal year 2025, Infosys projects cautious revenue growth of 1-3% in constant currency terms. Nonetheless, the company is proactively enhancing its offerings through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.\n\nNotably, collaborations with Nihon Chouzai, which aim to enhance healthcare access in Japan, could enable remote consultations and online payments with pharmacists. Additionally, a partnership with the French Tennis Federation introduced AI-powered features in the Roland Garros tournament in recent weeks, enhancing spectator experiences.\n\nSo far this year, INFY stock has declined nearly 3%, but offers an attractive 2.5% dividend yield. The shares are changing hands at 23.2 times forward earnings and 4 times sales. Analysts project a 12-month median price forecast of $19.3, signaling more than an\u00a08% upside.\n\niShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (EMXC) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nOur final pick among emerging market stocks to buy is the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (NASDAQ:EMXC). This exchange-traded fund gives access to large and mid-cap emerging market stocks, excluding those from China. The fund began trading in August 2017.\n\nEMXC holds 704 stocks, with the top ten accounting for nearly 25% of its $13.5 billion net assets.\u00a0 The fund\u2019s sector allocation is diverse, focusing on Information Technology (30%) and Financials (24%), along with Materials (8%), Industrials (8%), and Consumer Discretionary (7%). In terms of geographical distribution, assets are invested in India (26%) and Taiwan (25%). Other significant investments include South Korea (16%), Brazil (6%), and Saudi Arabia (5%).\n\nAmong the ETF\u2019s leading holdings are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), South Korean chip giant Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), Indian multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries (OTCMKTS:RLNIY), South Korean semiconductor group SK Hynix (OTCMKTS:HXSCF), and Taiwan-based electronics maker Hon Hai Precision Industry (OTCMKTS:HNHPF).\n\nYTD, EMXC has gained almost 5%. The ETF is attractively valued, trading at 16 times trailing earnings and 2 times book value. Additionally, it boasts a relatively low expense ratio of 0.25% and offers a 2% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding said it is seeing \"encouraging\" user engagement and merchant growth during the 618 midyear online shopping festival, as rival Xiaohongshu, China's answer to Instagram, said its online sales have tripled from a year ago.\n\nTaobao and Tmall Group, Alibaba's domestic e-commerce unit, has switched to a new strategy that focuses on consumers and small merchants during this year's festival, which runs from May 20 to June 20, as the company seeks to defend its dominant position in China's online shopping market.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nXiaohongshu, a social media app that lets users share lifestyle and travel content, has seen its e-commerce turnover triple during the festival by encouraging influencers to test out live-streaming e-commerce, the company said. Orders placed through the platform's live-streaming sessions from May 19 to June 10 jumped more than five times from last year, it said.\n\nNeither Alibaba nor Xiaohongshu, also known as Little Red Book, disclosed their gross merchandise value (GMV), a measure of total online sales in a given period.\n\nSales performance during 618, the country's second-largest online sales season after Singles' Day in the fourth quarter, is closely watched by analysts and investors as an indicator of a company's competitiveness in a cutthroat market.\n\nIn 2023, China's online retails sales amounted to 15.4 trillion yuan (US$2.12 trillion), up 11 per cent from the previous year, according to China's commerce ministry.\n\nAlibaba faces the onslaught of rising competitors, including ByteDance's Douyin - the Chinese version of TikTok - and Pinduoduo, the domestic budget shopping app of PDD Holdings.\n\nLast year, Alibaba's GMV reached 7.2 trillion yuan, compared to Pinduoduo's 4.05 trillion yuan and Douyin's 2.7 trillion yuan, according to a report by Chinese tech media outlet 36Kr. Newcomers such as Xiaohongshu and Tencent Holdings' short-video platform have also expanded their presence in the crowded sector.\n\nShanghai-based Xiaohongshu is one of China's fastest-growing social platforms, especially among young female consumers. The firm, which counts Alibaba and Tencent as investors, had 312 million monthly active users in 2023, a 20 per cent increase from the previous year, according to a Financial Times report.\n\nStory continues\n\nSophia Meng, a 30-year-old Beijing resident who spends one to two hours a day on Xiaohongshu, said she has bought clothes and tote bags on the platform, recommended to her by the app's algorithm.\n\nAnother user, who only gave her name as Rose, said she spends nearly four hours a day on the app. \"I buy products based on recommendations from influencers I follow,\" she said, adding that she finds the package tracking system on Xiaohongshu inferior to those of traditional e-commerce platforms.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Facing challenges in recent years, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is now starting see a rebound build. The company\u2019s share price is starting to see some recovery, with BABA stock up on the year as the company put forward strong recent earning reports.\n\nAnalysts are also growing increasingly positive on the Chinese e-commerce giant, with the average consensus price target suggesting 33% upside could be in the cards.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Q4 earnings impressed me (but maybe not the market), with revenue increasing by 7% due to excellent e-Commerce and cloud growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite economic challenges and regulatory pressures, Alibaba has demonstrated resilience, especially through its management of Tmall and Taobao. Both platforms saw a double-digit surge in Gross Merchandise Volume.\n\nOverseas commerce revenue soared by 45%, and cloud earnings rose, driven by a significant uptick in AI sales.\n\nThat said, BABA stock has continued to trade at a low valuation. So, the question is whether this is a stock with a valuation multiple that\u2019s permanently impaired, or a growth-at-a-reasonable-price play with big potential for long-term growth.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nExpanding in Global Market\n\nAlibaba is now looking to expand internationally by launching Alibaba Guaranteed. This service will cater to small business in both U.S. and Europe, and was made to enhance transparency in all processes like procurement, payments, and dispute resolution.\n\nPreviously unavailable for small retail businesses because of trade complexities, the service now offers better delivery tracking and free return options, aligning with current global trends.\n\nExperts have noted a surge in global supply chain fragmentation, as diverse businesses turn to international procurement. Chinese suppliers on Alibaba.com serve U.S., European, and global small businesses, prioritizing corporate clients in supplier registration.\n\nKuo Jian highlights a threefold increase in Alibaba.com buyers over five years, with growing electric vehicle demand boosting automotive parts sales.\n\nNatalya Milchakova, a prominent analyst at Freedom Finance Global, highlights the timeliness of introducing \u201cAlibaba Guaranteed\u201d for European firms due to escalating return costs and inflation. Milchakova predicts that integrating artificial intelligence into this service will expand Alibaba\u2019s European customer base.\n\nExcellent AIDC Segment\n\nIn the partnership, Alibaba.com rolled out various initiatives to aid SMEs, providing deals and advanced sourcing tools for soccer merchandise sales. The collaboration with UEFA is expected to heighten Alibaba\u2019s appeal among European SMEs.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ4 2024 showed $3.8 billion revenues from the AIDC segment, showing a 45% year-over-year growth. Alibaba also prioritized AliExpress by integrating logistics through Cainiao. BABA heightened investments in key markets to boost AliExpress\u2019 global market presence and customer experience.\n\nAlibaba has thrived amid competition, driven by robust momentum in its international retail sector. Strong order growth and AliExpress\u2019 Choice bolstered performance. The wholesale commerce business benefited from cross-border added services, with China\u2019s wholesale sector expanding positively.\n\nRobust Growth in 2024\n\nAlibaba.com\u2019s president, Zhang Kuo, forecasts a potential 20% growth in gross merchandise volume (GMV) to $60 billion in 2024, as per a June 6 interview. Despite slowing B2B marketplace growth, Alibaba pushes for innovation and transformation to sustain momentum.\n\nWith the Alibaba Guaranteed, Alibaba is offering fixed-price procurement with shipping included, aiming to streamline B2B cross-border trade. Zhang highlights its potential to simplify global sourcing for SMEs. With over 48 million SME buyers, Alibaba.com aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in the marketplace.\n\nBuy BABA Stock Now\n\nI\u2019m growing increasingly bullish on Alibaba at its current price point. This is a cloud and e-commerce player with AI related tailwinds the market isn\u2019t pricing in.\n\nGiven the demographics behind the markets in which Alibaba is most dominant (China and other Asian nations), there\u2019s a lot to like about the company\u2019s growth prospects moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "A recent boom in convertible bond sales is kindling hopes that Hong Kong's capital market is warming up after a years-long chill, with Wall Street banks readying themselves to bask in the glow.\n\nA combined US$10.5 billion in convertible bond offerings by Chinese tech leaders including JD.com, Alibaba Group Holding, Trip.com and Lenovo Group has swept the market in the past two weeks. As a result, total convertible bond issuance in Asia, excluding Japan, is on track to match 2023's total of US$13.5 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nHedge funds piled into Alibaba's US$5 billion issuance - Asia's largest-ever convertible bond transaction and the world's biggest since 2008 - making the public deal more than five times oversubscribed. Alibaba owns the Post.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nBankers said they have not seen the market this busy since 2021 when the homecoming of Chinese-American Depository Receipts boosted the initial public offering (IPO) market and US-China accounting disputes and geopolitical concerns had yet to cast a pall over the market.\n\nMore deals are in the works, they said.\n\n\"Some of the recent deals have had levels of oversubscription that we saw at the peak of the market in 2021,\" said Saurabh Dinakar, co-head of Asia-Pacific global capital markets at Morgan Stanley. \"The convertible bond issuance surge is certainly a big boost for investor confidence and issuer sentiment.\"\n\nA convertible bond is a debt-like instrument that pays interest and includes an upside call option to convert into the underlying stock. It can help issuers reduce financing costs compared with traditional bond sales when interest rates are elevated, while also providing investors with equity upside potential and downside protection.\n\nDoing a \"jumbo-sized\" convertible bond sale and using a portion of the proceeds to fund a concurrent stock buy-back is front of mind for a lot of Chinese issuers after witnessing recent successful cases, according to Rob Chan, Asia-Pacific head of equity-linked origination at Citigroup.\n\n\"Despite having cash available, if they are able to sustain more leverage on balance sheets, issuing a convertible at current low costs provides better capital efficiency,\" Chan said. People are coming to terms with the idea that rates will stay higher for longer, and this is sparking more conversations with companies thinking about using convertibles, he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nFood delivery platform Meituan, which announced a US$2 billion stock repurchase plan on Wednesday, is reportedly working with Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on a convertible sale, according to Mergermarket. Some tech companies in Taiwan and Australia are also getting more active in the space, and even companies in more traditional sectors in Southeast Asia are considering similar moves, according to Chan.\n\nHong Kong's initial public offering market could get a boost from rising sentiment, Morgan Stanley banker says. Photo: Yik Yeung-man alt=Hong Kong's initial public offering market could get a boost from rising sentiment, Morgan Stanley banker says. Photo: Yik Yeung-man>\n\nFrom the investor point of view, economic recovery expectations for mainland China are driving interest in convertible bonds. \"Convertible bonds are extremely attractive to buy into if one believes that China and the macro environment provide potential upside,\" said Chan.\n\nThe surge in convertible bonds is also a shot of confidence for overall market sentiment. Investors have accumulated \"a fair bit of dry powder\" over the past two years and are now looking to deploy this for the right opportunities, said Morgan Stanley's Dinakar, adding that a continued level of health in the markets for follow-on and convertible bonds should bode well for IPOs.\n\n\"Our hope is that this would be a precursor or a preview for eventually the IPO market to come back,\" he said.\n\nFunds raised by new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell 32 per cent in the first half of the year to HK$12.1 billion (US$1.55 billion) year on year, according to an estimate by EY on Thursday. But the market now shows signs of a nascent recovery. For example, public investors oversubscribed Tencent-backed artificial intelligence drug researcher QuantumPharm's IPO by 103 times before its listing on Thursday.\n\nInsurer FWD Group Holdings is keeping \"a close eye\" on market conditions amid speculation that its owner, the tycoon Richard Li Tzar-kai, wants to revive his Hong Kong IPO plan, which could value the company as high as US$9 billion.\n\n\"In general, we are optimistic about the prospects for 2024,\" Dinakar said. \"There's a good pipeline in Australia [and] India, and it's great to see China come back.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Major investment banks are asking Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange to allow companies with a primary listing in the city to do share buybacks and convertible bond sales simultaneously, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Tesla Investors Back Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Deal, Texas Move Apple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable. Tech Powers Stocks as Adobe Surges in Late Trading: Markets Wrap\n\nThe request follows a flurry of high-profile issuances by Chinese technology companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com and Trip.com, which raised billions of dollars in convertible bond sales and used some of the proceeds to repurchase their American depositary receipts. They could do that as their main listings are in the US. In Hong Kong it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\n\nHong Kong requires Extraordinary General Meeting approval for the kind of share buybacks that trio of tech companies did with the convertible bond proceeds, making it impossible to do such deals overnight, the people said.\n\nBanks and law firms have met with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks aren\u2019t public.\n\nA representative for HKEX said the company cannot comment on any ongoing discussions, but it is always looking for ways to enhance competitiveness and efficiency of markets for issuers and investors.\n\nThe discussions come as authorities try to breathe life into Hong Kong\u2019s listless financial markets, where major deals have largely dried up. The recent convertible bond offerings by the Chinese tech firms have at least been a rare bright spot for business \u2014 and fees \u2014 at the big investment banks.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s convertible bond sale last month was a record dollar-denominated issuance by an Asian company. The tech giant said at the time it would use part of the $4.5 billion proceeds to repurchase 14.8 million ADRs, as well as to fund future buybacks.\n\nThe strategy enables companies to repurchase a large chunk of shares in one go, while minimizing the dilution that can occur if buyers of its bonds decide to convert them into shares. The concurrent repurchase also helps investors who are seeking to buy the convertible debt and sell the stock as a hedge against it.\n\nWhile US-traded Chinese tech firms have resorted to the instruments, many subsequently listed in Hong Kong and converted their listing status to dual primary, meaning they\u2019d be unable to sell convertible bonds and buy back shares with the proceeds.\n\nStory continues\n\nConvertible arbitrage funds are the main target investor group for these placements, which are an inexpensive funding option for the large share buybacks carried out by Alibaba, JD.com and Trip.com, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Cecilia Chan and Timothy Tan wrote in a June 11 note.\n\nHigh dollar yields and volatility, combined with low equity valuations, may encourage more Asian issuers to consider convertible bonds as a funding source, the BI analysts wrote, suggesting that Meituan could be next in line given the decline in the online shopping platform\u2019s equity value.\n\n--With assistance from Kiuyan Wong.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It is not unusual for stocks to do better than analysts predict. There are several reasons why this could happen, but it usually means that investors have the opportunity to profit from the market by betting on them. There is a group of investors whose entire strategy is this: to bet on stocks that Wall Street Analysts have written off.\n\nThis year, the best-overwritten stocks cover some of the world\u2019s most promising industries, from gaming to cosmetics and e-commerce. Their performance has exceeded all expectations, and from all indications, they are the best stocks to buy going into the second half of the year.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll cover these stocks in-depth, discussing how they\u2019ve performed so well in the market and what makes them valuable portfolio additions for investors looking for the best stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is a popular online game platform where users can create or play games made by others. It is one of the pioneers of the online video-gaming era and has received massive success.\n\nThe company has experienced turbulence this year, producing underwhelming numbers in the ongoing fiscal quarter. It fell significantly below its $870 \u2013 $900 million estimate and had to lower its full-year guidance. It also fell by 27%, causing concern among investors who worry about how it might fare in an economic recession.\n\nDespite these adversities, Roblox is showing great perseverance in the market, and if its recent history is anything to go by, it would be unwise to count it out. According to its most recent quarterly report, its top line is up by 22%, a significant improvement from previous quarters.\n\nFurthermore, the company is involved in a series of partnerships that could boost its value in the year\u2019s second half. Nike, Walmart and Fenty are some companies that utilize Roblox\u2019s in-game advertising experience to engage consumers and increase product sales. From all indications, there is a lot to look forward to from the company.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an American beauty and cosmetics giant with a chain of cosmetic stores scattered across the country. Its stores house some of the most popular cosmetic brands in the world, from Fenty to Chanel and Cerave.\n\nEven though beauty and cosmetics retailers are experiencing a tough time due to the emergence of online beauty stores and the subsequent eradication of retailers and other middlemen, Ulta Beauty remains unphased. If anything, they may have benefitted from this industry shift. Much of this is due to its strong offline and online presence, the wide variety of brands it sells and its many stores (around 1,400 in the US).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe combining all these factors contributes to the company\u2019s impressive performance this year. Furthermore, its share price is an absolute bargain and an ideal option for investors looking for stocks to buy as the second half of the year begins. Its current share price is around $25 and $26.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce giant specializing in everything from clothing and jewelry to electronics and accessories. Whatever you are looking for, the odds are that you will find it on Alibaba.\n\nMore impressively, the company is a parent to smaller e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and Tmall, and has a strong hold on the Chinese market. You might wonder why Wall Street Analysts did not have high hopes for it this year. The last few years have been rough for the company, partly because of the heavy-handed pandemic lockdowns in China that lasted from 2020 through late 2022.\n\nDespite this, Alibaba has exhibited tremendous resilience and is now rebounding in the market. According to its latest quarterly report, it is up 45% in foreign commerce revenue. It will likely continue to put up impressive numbers for the remainder of the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Sell in June Before They Dive",
        "content": "Growth stocks are names that are anticipated to grow at a rate significantly above the market itself. The companies listed below are expected to grow a great deal by their most zealous advocates. However, the firms profiled in this column are extensively overvalued. These growth stocks to sell are likely to disappoint bulls while their valuations are far too high.\n\nImportantly, the valuations of some of these growth stocks to sell have become stretched in recent weeks due to the revival of the meme-stock trend. But the momentum is generally weak. And many of these names are unable to sustain even the initial gains they\u2019ve registered. I believe that most or all of the momentum will be lost in the medium-term. With that in mind, here are three growth stocks to sell.\n\nGameStop (GME)\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTroubled retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) has risen on the back of the meme stock revival. This has been helped by positive remarks about GME stock by Roaring Kitty, the meme-stock investor and commentator.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut Roaring Kitty, who holds 120,000 call options on GME stock that expire on June 21, is likely focused on obtaining large, short-term gains from his involvement with the name. While it\u2019s true that he also owns 5 million shares of GameStop, he can quickly sell that position as well.\n\nAnd speaking of unloading the company\u2019s shares, CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s stake in the firm has dropped to 8.6%, versus 10.5% last month. Cohen\u2019s decision to sell a large number of the company\u2019s shares does not bode well for its longer-term outlook.\n\nAnother negative for GME is the fact that GameStop recently sold an additional $2.14 billion of its shares. And the 29% decline in the firm\u2019s first-quarter revenue versus the same period a year earlier likewise makes me more bearish on the name.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is another meme name. However, the momentum of AMC stock appears to have greatly weakened in recent weeks. After hitting a recent high of $11.88 at the beginning of the meme-stock revival, the stock price is now not much higher than the $4.54 low it on March 15.\n\nMeanwhile, another InvestorPlace columnist, Rich Duprey, recently reported that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, one of this year\u2019s summer blockbusters, probably won\u2019t be profitable. That indicates that the film isn\u2019t drawing a large number of viewers, boding poorly for AMC\u2019s Q2 performance. Duprey believes that two other movies due out soon, Deadpool & Wolverine and Despicable Me 4, will perform better at the box office. Still, as he points out, \u201d\u00a0it\u2019s tough to run a business on just a pair of hits every year.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd as I noted in a recent column, the company\u2019s attendance in the U.S. dropped 5.8% in Q1 year-over-year. Meanwhile, it burned a huge $268 million of cash in the 12 months that ended in March.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it\u2019s clear that AMC\u2019s fundamentals are quite poor.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese e-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is facing very tough competition on multiple fronts.\n\nBABA stock is being threatened by the rapid growth of two other Chinese e-commerce firms, JD.com ( NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). Alibaba\u2019s share of the Chinese e-commerce market tumbled to 37% last year from 80% in 2017.\n\nBloomberg recently noted that Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit slashed its prices by as much as 97%. The company even lowered the prices that it charges for nine of its artificial intelligence-powered offerings.\n\nIn Q1, Alibaba\u2019s EBITDA fell to $4.82 billion from $4.97 billion during the same period a year earlier.\n\nGiven these points, BABA stock definitely belongs on everyone\u2019s list of growth stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Just Made a Once-in-a-Generation Bet on This Stock. Time to Buy?",
        "content": "David Tepper has never been averse to making big bets. Many of them have paid off handsomely and helped make him one of the wealthiest people on the planet. Tepper's net worth of $20.6 billion landed him at No. 94 among Forbes' ranking of the world's billionaires.\n\nThe Appaloosa hedge fund manager isn't one to rest on his laurels either. Tepper just made what's arguably a once-in-a-generation bet on one stock.\n\nA bull in the China shop\n\nYou might say that Tepper is a bull in the China shop these days. In the first quarter of 2024, he increased Appaloosa's stake in Chinese online retailer PDD Holdings, which operates Pinduoduo and Temu, by nearly 171%. The billionaire investor upped his hedge fund's holdings of Chinese search provider Baidu by 188%. He also initiated a new position in Chinese e-commerce company JD.com.\n\nHowever, Tepper invested the heaviest in another Chinese tech company, Alibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA). He bought 6.9 million additional shares of Alibaba in Q1. This increased Appaloosa's stake by nearly 159% to over $814 million. Alibaba now ranks as the largest holding in the hedge fund's investment portfolio.\n\nTepper first bought Alibaba stock in 2014 but quickly exited the position. He invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2015 but again sold all of his shares soon afterward. The billionaire investor repeated this pattern of buying Alibaba but not holding it for very long in 2017 and 2019.\n\nAppaloosa's current position in Alibaba has lasted longer, though. The hedge fund initiated a new position in the stock in the second quarter of 2022. Tepper has bought and sold shares of the Chinese tech company several times since then. But his recent purchase reflects the largest amount he has ever invested in Alibaba in one quarter.\n\nWhy Tepper probably likes Alibaba\n\nWe can only speculate why Tepper likes Alibaba so much. However, I think there are three reasons that especially stand out.\n\nThe first is valuation. Alibaba's share price has plunged roughly 75% below its peak set in late 2020. The stock now trades at a forward earnings multiple of under 9.5. That's nearly unheard of for tech stocks.\n\nSecond, Tepper appears to expect the Chinese economy to hold up relatively well. If he didn't, I seriously doubt he would be pouring so much of Appaloosa's money into Chinese stocks.\n\nThird, I suspect Tepper likes Alibaba's growth prospects over the next few years as it hitches its wagon to artificial intelligence (AI). Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai and CEO Eddie Wu wrote to shareholders last month that AI is \"the single most powerful element that will change and accelerate the growth of our businesses.\" Tsai also told the audience at JPMorgan Chase's annual Global China Summit in May, \"We're the only company [in China] that both runs a leading cloud business and is competitive in AI.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it time to buy Alibaba stock?\n\nWith billionaire Tepper investing so heavily in Alibaba, is it time for other investors to buy the stock? Maybe, but not for everyone.\n\nRisk-averse investors should probably steer clear of Alibaba for now. China's economic problems could be worse than they appear. Economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman believes that the country's economic model isn't sustainable. Both President Joe Biden and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump favor increased tariffs on China, which could further complicate matters.\n\nHowever, aggressive long-term investors willing to accept potentially high volatility could find Alibaba attractive. The company could have great growth prospects, especially from hosting AI applications on its cloud platform. Tepper's once-in-a-generation bet could be one that other investors could want to get in on, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "A 17-year-old student majoring in fashion design, who is self-taught in maths, beat all the artificial intelligence (AI) teams to get into the finals of the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition, according to the final list issued by the organiser, Alibaba's DAMO Academy.\n\nJust over 800 competitors with an average age of 22 qualified for the final competition to be held on June 22. The majority of finalists are students, including those from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge University as well as Peking University and Tsinghua University.\n\nJiang Ping, who studies fashion design at Jiangsu vocational school and spent two years studying maths on her own, became the surprise black horse. Jiang ranked 12th place in the final list and earned 93 points. She said she wants to prove \"girls can also learn maths well\".\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe winners of the final competition will share prizes of more than 4 million yuan (US$552,120).\n\nThis is the first time that Alibaba's open-to-all maths competition has allowed AI to assist with solving questions, and it attracted more than 563 teams from different universities and companies around the world. More than half of the participants were born after 2000, according to the DAMO Academy.\n\n\"AI challenges are a meaningful attempt, which can help us to break through the limitation of AI's capability,\" said Yin Wotao, the head of the decision intelligence lab of DAMO Academy and a committee member of the competition.\n\nA signboard for DAMO Academy is pictured at an exhibition.

The top three AI teams were from Shanghai Jianping High School, Southwest Jiaotong University, and Renmin University of China.\n\nAlthough the AI scores already reached the average level of human participants, they were still far from the level of a maths master, as the capability of the underlying model in maths was limited, according to the source from DAMO Academy.\n\nAI can achieve basic scores through knowledge searching when facing solution and proof questions. However, it may trip up with an \"illusion of knowledge\" when the questions go further, especially for multiple choice, the source added.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the source pointed out that some participants used prompt words to make AI act as a \"master of maths competition\", and they even promised to give the AI US$300,000 if it could win the game, which increased the accuracy by 20 per cent.\n\nThe competition, held by Post owner Alibaba Group Holding, is open to all and aims to stimulate enthusiasm for mathematics.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -6.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has lost 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.24 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +13.7%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.9%. This estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.20 indicates a change of +12.2% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for BABA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $34.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.2%. The $138.63 billion and $148.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.2% and +7.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $30.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +12.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The best Chinese stocks are in prime position for a rebound later this year.\n\nRay Dalio, the billionaire behind the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, recently discussed the attractiveness of Chinese stocks amidst market uncertainty. Dalio advocates for diversification into Chinese stocks and highlights how the upcoming presidential election presents a major risk for the U.S. market.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a list of three of the most attractively priced Chinese stocks to buy, offering tremendous upside potential. Taking it from Dalio, the strategic shift towards buying the best Chinese stocks offers a significant opportunity to expand and balance your investment portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) has been dead money in the past few years, with multiple headwinds weighing down its business. However, the trailblazer in eCommerce and cloud computing is in for a major rebound, as it starts posting robust quarterly results again. Wall Street analysts also concur, assigning a \u201cbuy\u201d rating to the stock, offering a 33% upside from current prices.\n\nBABA released its Q4 results last month, showing it is back on the growth track. Revenues jumped 7% to $30.7 billion, beating estimates by a healthy $310 million. Moreover, its investments in Alibaba Cloud and eCommerce led to double-digit growth in its gross merchandise value. What was most heartening was the strong single-digit growth in its core eCommerce business despite a weak Chinese retail environment.\n\nThe star of the show was Alibaba Cloud division, which posted a strong 3% increase in sales to $3.5 billion. These results were linked to the triple-digit growth in AI-related sales, which boosted overall cloud sales in the robust public cloud sector.\n\nNetEase (NTES) netease (NTES) logo on a mobile phone screen representing earnings reports\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) is a leading Chinese mobile gaming company with a revenue base exceeding $14.5 billion.\n\nDespite its relatively strong top-line performance and robust bottom-line position, NTES stock has fallen out of favor with investors. Nevertheless, it continues to prove its detractors wrong with its strong operating performances. Its most recent Q1 report saw $3.7 billion in sales, a 7.2% increase year-over-year (YOY). Moreover, its Non-GAAP ADS of $1.84\u00a0beat estimates by 12 cents. Additionally, its recent annual product launch event showcased several promising new games, pointing to a stellar content pipeline.\n\nNetEase has the edge in China\u2019s burgeoning mobile gaming market, which currently commands a whopping 47% of global mobile gaming revenue. Despite the country\u2019s declining population, the number of gamers in China could top 730 million by 2027. Moreover, with a staggering 31% of China\u2019s domestic market spend directed towards mobile games, the company\u2019s offerings are indispensable.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu (BIDU) A Baidu (BIDU) sign outside a company office in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which is considered China\u2019s Google, has been pioneering AI long before it became cool. Over the past decade, the firm established major research facilities in Beijing and California. Moreover, in 2019, it launched its revolutionary chatbot called Ernie, which now has upwards of 200 million users. Additionally, its enterprise client base has topped 85,000, which will likely be critical in driving its top-line growth moving forward.\n\nIt recently delivered its Q1 report, comfortably surpassing estimates across both lines. Baidu\u2019s non-GAAP ADS rose a remarkable 24% YOY to $2.76. Meanwhile, total\u00a0sales increased by 1% YOY to $4.37 billion.\n\nRevenues from its core operations increased by 4% YOY to $3.3 billion, driven by healthy growth in its online and non-online marketing sales. Non-online marketing sales, in particular, jumped 6% to $935 million, led by the rapid increase in its AI cloud business.\n\nThese stellar results have led to multiple upward revisions, with Wall Street analysts assigning a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating to the stock, forecasting a 58% upside potential from current prices.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Michael Burry Has 26% of His Portfolio Invested in These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Michal Burry stocks have a certain cache. Most people know Burry as the investor who correctly saw the housing market crash of 2007 to 2008. He understood that the government\u2019s subprime mortgage policies would collapse the housing market. Scion Capital profited nearly $1 billion by betting against the housing market.\n\nThe events were chronicled in the book, \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which was subsequently made into a movie of the same name that spread Burry\u2019s fame even wider.\n\nBut Burry is a smart investor beyond his housing market call. His investment in GameStop (NYSE:GME) in 2019 unwittingly led to the meme stock frenzy surrounding the video game retailer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough he was not an \u201cape\u201d who held on for dear life during its momentous ride in 2021, he reportedly made $250 million on his original $14 million investment.\n\nWhile he closed Scion Capital in 2008, he now runs Scion Asset Management, a hedge fund that has over $103 million in assets under management.\n\nAlthough subprime mortgages are making a comeback today under a new name, Burry isn\u2019t betting against housing today, at least not yet. Instead, 26% of Scion\u2019s portfolio is invested in the three Michael Burry stocks below. Let\u2019s see if they should be in your portfolio, too.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen everyone was fleeing Chinese stocks due to geopolitical tensions, Burry was rushing in. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, as shares of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) began their descent from $41 per share, Burry began buying them, scooping up 125,000 shares.\n\nHe added another 75,000 shares in the fourth quarter and bought 160,000 more in the first quarter of 2024, for a total of 360,000 shares.\n\nWhile JD.com stock would end up falling as low as $22 a stub in mid-January, they soon began marching higher and hit $35 last month.\n\nThey\u2019ve since fallen back to around $29 a share, which is in line with Burry\u2019s average buy-in price of $29.53, putting him essentially at break-even.\n\nJD.com is Burry\u2019s biggest holding, accounting for 9.5% of Scion\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce platform is in turnaround mode. JD.com was caught flat-footed by a sluggish economy and not focusing on its online retail business while upstarts like PDD Holdings\u2018 (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu took share with deep discount pricing.\n\nJD responded with its own aggressive pricing and by dropping minimum order requirements for free delivery. The moves paid off. Its fourth-quarter earnings report easily beat analyst expectations as it drove tremendous traffic to its site again.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe e-commerce site also kicked off its annual 618 shopping extravaganza on May 31 with a theme of \u201cquality and affordability.\u201d It is the equivalent of Amazon\u2018s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Day event but on steroids.\n\nAnalysts estimate JD sold around $60 billion worth of merchandise last year. Look for JD stock to rebound going forward.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com\u2019s peer Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is Burry\u2019s second largest holding at $9 million, or 8.7% of Scion\u2019s portfolio. It is clear the hedge fund operator sees a lot of opportunity from China\u2019s biggest retailers.\n\nBurry began buying BABA stock at the same time he picked up shares of its rival and he now owns 125,000 shares worth $9 million.\n\nThe stock has undergone a similar journey to JD.com and Burry\u2019s average buy price is $80. Alibaba currently trades around $78 per share.\n\nFor many of the same reasons as JD.com, the outlook for Alibaba stock is just as bright. The Chinese government is supporting both consumers with new stimulus programs and companies by acting as a buyer of last resort for their stock.\n\nBecause China\u2019s stock market doesn\u2019t have circuit breakers like U.S. markets to minimize volatility, the government will step in and buy shares if they fall too hard too fast. It provides a floor of sorts for the stock, not that they can\u2019t fall through it though.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s improved operations while also focusing again on its core e-commerce business, provides plenty of runway for future growth.\n\nHCA Healthcare (HCA) a hand holding an iPhon with an HCA logo on the screen\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) is one of the largest hospital chains in the U.S., with facilities all across the country, but with a special focus on New York and Florida.\n\nRevenue and profits are moving higher for the hospital operator. First-quarter revenue jumped 11% to $17.3 billion while profits of $1.6 billion or $5.93 per share, were 22% higher. \u200b\u200b\n\nSame facility admissions increased 6.2% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 5.2%. Equally important, revenue per equivalent admissions was up 4% from the year ago period. Emergency room visits were 7% higher.\n\nBurry established a new position in HCA Healthcare in the fourth quarter last year buying 20,000 shares and adding 5,000 more in the first quarter. The 25,000 total is worth $8.3 million, making it Burry\u2019s third-largest holding at 8.1% of the portfolio\u2019s total.\n\nHis average buy-in price is $267 per share, giving Burry gains of 26% on HCA Healthcare\u2019s current price of $337 per share. There is no reason it can\u2019t go higher as health care, especially hospital care, remains an essential service few will go without.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If ever there was doubt about just how much artificial intelligence (AI) has captured the imagination of investors and the public at large, simply look at the rock-star treatment of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at Computex in Taipei at the start of June.\n\nThere he unveiled plans for an annual release cycle of chips that would power generative AI (GenAI), robotics and advanced data centres that he referred to as \"AI factories\".\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe global excitement around the world's most valuable semiconductor company has reached a fever pitch, but Huang's talk may have landed a bit differently across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWashington's restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductors to China mean Nvidia's most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) cannot be shipped or sold to mainland Chinese companies.\n\nWith the new fervent pace of upgrades, China could fall further behind in the AI race even as companies pour resources into keeping up in the realm of GenAI.\n\nOn the software side, Chinese tech giants and start-ups alike are flooding the market with large language models - the tech that undergirds chatbots such as ChatGPT.\n\nWith China's internet services industry largely sandboxed off from the rest of the world, having the most cutting-edge frontier models is less of an issue. Many AI start-ups are building on Meta Platforms' open-source Llama models, anyway.\n\nInstead, Chinese companies are left competing on the one thing that has ravaged so many tech markets before it: price.\n\nA new price war is emerging in China, precipitated by ByteDance's latest Doubao models priced 99.8 per cent less than OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\nE-commerce conglomerate Alibaba followed suit, as did internet search giant Baidu, social media and video gaming behemoth Tencent, and specialised AI firms iFlytek and SenseTime, both sanctioned by the US.\n\nThe most recent entrant in the price war is start-up Zhipu AI, one of China's four \"AI tigers\".\n\nSenseTime co-founder and CEO Xu Li told the Post in May that companies were just trying to attract more clients and build their brands. And he expects his company to be profitable in two years.\n\nSome companies such as Baidu have pointed to improving efficiencies in running the energy-intensive models as the reason behind the price reductions.\n\nNvidia has even been touting the massively improved power efficiency of its latest Blackwell GPUs. Stanford computer scientist Bill MacCartney explained to me in late May that these improvements were happening at every layer of the tech stack, from silicon to software.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis poses a challenge for Chinese AI firms without access to the bleeding edge of semiconductor production. Reuters reported that some Chinese AI companies are downgrading their chip designs just to get access to some of the manufacturing capacity of the world's leading chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.\n\nAlibaba co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai has said that he expects China to eventually \"develop its own ability to make these high-end GPUs\", but he also said that the country's AI champions are maybe two years behind those in the US.\n\nChina's chip champions are scrambling to eke out whatever performance gains they can with equipment stockpiled before the US further escalated sanctions last year.\n\nA Huawei executive recently said its Ascend 910B could match the performance in some tasks as that of Nvidia's A100, the predecessor of the chip maker's leading H100 that is set to be replaced with the Blackwell chips.\n\nIn a market with limited access to Nvidia's top hardware, Huawei has emerged as one potential solution to a complicated problem. The company's chips are showing up in so-called AI boxes, all-in-one machines meant for small businesses. The price of a single machine can run anywhere from 300,000 yuan (US$41,400) to north of 2 million yuan.\n\nNvidia is trying to hang on to the bits of the Chinese market that do not need the most cutting-edge tech.\n\nIt may help that the yields for Huawei's most advanced chips are likely relatively low. The Chinese tech firm is currently exploring ways to push a chip-making technique to its limits to produce 5-nanometre and 3-nm semiconductors, according to a patent made public in March.\n\nNvidia co-founder and CEO Huang has said that Huawei would eventually find ways of overcoming its limitations.\n\n\"They'll still be able to build very large systems by aggregating many of those chips together,\" he told Wired in February.\n\nThis, of course, means forgoing the power-efficiency gains from newer chips, and the lower costs associated with that.\n\nIf price reductions in China really are entirely the result of efficiency gains, then everyone in the market is winning - consumers, third-party service providers and the AI companies themselves.\n\nBut given the Chinese tech industry's history of price wars, things could get cutthroat while tech firms burn through cash.\n\nScepticism is already starting to emerge as industry insiders and outsiders alike question the true value of these AI systems that are known for often generating false information and derivative work that requires a lot of editing.\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer, known for his work on the impact of technology in economic development, told me at the end of May that he doubts AI is going to change the world any more than cryptocurrencies did - which is to say, not much.\n\n\"I think there's a very good chance that we're going through a bubble right now, and that reflects excessive optimism about what AI is going to deliver,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, an overflow of optimism may be the order of the day - except when people are warning of Armageddon. And at least as far as consumers are concerned, AI price wars could bode well for them - and their wallets - in the near future, whether the aim is to get more work done or even produce imperial Chinese poetry.\n\nHuawei says its AI chip better than Nvidia's A100 amid China's self-reliance drive.\n\nViral video of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signing fan's chest at tech expo sparks social media frenzy.\n\nAs Huawei looks towards more advanced semiconductors, speculation swirls on how far it can push existing chip-making gear.\n\nChina's lawmakers call for more AI development to catch up with US, while keeping it under regulatory control.\n\nVideo: SenseTime CEO expects Hong Kong-listed firm to turn a profit in 2 years with generative AI business.\n\nTencent launches Yuanbao AI chatbot in bid to close gap with Baidu and ByteDance.\n\nBaidu, Zhipu AI top Chinese AI rankings, but OpenAI still technical leader.\n\nOpinion: Sino-US talks on AI are off to positive start.\n\nChinese AI innovation identifies oesophageal cancer lesions at double rate of doctors' assessment by eye: paper.\n\nChina plans leading role in global AI race on standards and computing power push.\n\nMoonshot AI's Kimi Chatbot offers paid service in bid to profit from mass users.\n\nVideo: Taiwanese entertainer uses artificial intelligence to bring back deceased daughter.\n\nOpinion: As US mulls AI guard rails, China and France are offering a different playbook.\n\nIllustration: Henry Wong alt=Illustration: Henry Wong>\n\nNew AI, old tricks: price war engulfs Chinese tech firms large and small\n\nThe price of AI services in China plummeted in May after ByteDance kicked off a price war by pricing access to its LLMs at 99.8 per cent below GPT-4\n\nIndustry insiders fear the harm could be fatal for many start-ups, but app developers are enjoying cheaper access to the tech powering their services\n\nIn the 18 months since Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Chinese tech firms large and small have rallied around a singular goal - besting the San Francisco-based start-up with their own Chinese-language chatbots.\n\nThe results have been mixed, with some tech giants claiming to have better results than GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced model, with Chinese queries. But with a deluge of more than 200 Chinese large language models (LLMs) - the tech powering these chatbots - from a slew of companies all jostling for market share, China's AI firms can claim at least one other clear, albeit less boastworthy, advantage over their US counterparts: price.\n\nRead more.\n\nPhoto: Handout alt=Photo: Handout>\n\nEconomist Paul Romer sees AI as hype, FDI real path to growth\n\nAI is 'going through a kind of a bubble right now', the Nobel Prize-winning economist said, suggesting limits to the tech's capabilities could soon set in\n\nThe US and China should compete in foreign direct investment, but projects like Belt and Road must focus on sustainable areas like real estate, he said\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) industry is \"going through a kind of a bubble right now\" and could soon hit a ceiling when it comes to productivity gains, according to Nobel laureate and former chief economist at the World Bank Paul Romer.\n\n\"The growth of digital technology hasn't in the past ushered us into this new era of much more rapid productivity growth, and I doubt that it's going to do it now,\" Romer told the South China Morning Post on the sidelines of the UBS Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday. \"So I think the perception that somehow everything has changed is like the perception that cyber currencies are going to change the world.\"\n\nRead more.\n\nPhoto: Aly Song alt=Photo: Aly Song>\n\nHong Kong-listed SenseTime aims for profit in 2 years on generative AI frenzy\n\nThe company has set a goal of 100 per cent growth for its generative AI business this year, CEO and co-founder Xu Li told the Post in an interview\n\nSenseTime has explored opportunities outside its traditional AI business, including smart city and smart business solutions\n\nSenseTime, one of China's artificial intelligence (AI) pioneers, is aiming for profitability within the next two years as revenue from its generative AI business tripled last year, and is expected to become the company's new profit engine, according to CEO and co-founder Xu Li.\n\nHong Kong-listed SenseTime reported revenue of 1.184 billion yuan (US$163.4 million) from its generative AI-related business for 2023, marking a 199.9 per cent year-on-year increase, according to its latest annual financial report.\n\nRead more.\n\nPhoto: TNS alt=Photo: TNS>\n\nElon Musk deepfake crypto scam highlights risks to Hong Kong\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission has warned of a fraudulent crypto trading platform called Quantum AI, a long-time scam that uses deepfakes of Elon Musk\n\nHong Kong has proven particularly susceptible to AI-related scams, with fintech industry fraud growing 3.8 per cent in the first quarter\n\nLast week, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) warned of a scam using deepfakes of Elon Musk touting a cryptocurrency trading platform called \"Quantum AI\". The scam is old, but it highlights an alarming rise in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to commit fraud - and Asia has proven particularly susceptible.\n\nIn its public warning on May 8, the SFC said that Quantum AI makes claims of being able to earn \"too-good-to-be-true\" returns and the regulator made a request to the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to related websites and social media pages. The linked domains were inaccessible as of this week, and the Facebook groups appear to have been removed.\n\nRead more.\n\nIllustration: Davies Christian Surya alt=Illustration: Davies Christian Surya>\n\nHong Kong's film industry is turning to AI.

While the start-up told the Post on Thursday that there had been some \"discrepancies\" in local reporting about the amount raised, several outlets estimated Baichuan's latest valuation to be at about US$1.8 billion.\n\nRead more.\n\nIllustration: Henry Wong alt=Illustration: Henry Wong>\n\nAlibaba reorients business, rejigs overhaul after catalogue of mistakes\n\nAlibaba has made dramatic changes to its corporate restructuring plan as founders Jack Ma and Joe Tsai return to the driver's seat\n\nThe e-commerce giant is betting on improved shopping experiences, artificial intelligence and a strengthened overseas push to regain momentum\n\nWhen Alibaba Group Holding bought a controlling stake in supermarket chain Sun Art Retail in late 2020, it paid HK$28 billion (US$3.6 billion), or HK$8.1 per share, for the chance to take a larger bite of the bulging wallets of Chinese consumers.\n\nBut Alibaba's \"new retailing\" vision of synergising online and offline shopping never took off. Three and a half years later, the acquired stake has lost 80 per cent of its value, based on Sun Art's recent share price. The asset has also become a heavy burden with its falling revenues and a vast payroll of 100,000 employees.\n\nRead more.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock alt=Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nChina said to fall short of matching US advances in AI amid major challenges\n\nMany Chinese-developed AI models have been built on Meta Platforms' Llama system, according to a presentation made to Chinese Premier Li Qiang\n\nThe presentation at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence also pointed out issues related to computing infrastructure for training AI models\n\nChina is falling short of matching the United States in artificial intelligence (AI) advances because the nation's efforts are \"littered with many essential challenges in theory and technologies\", according to a recent slide presentation made to Chinese Premier Li Qiang.\n\nThose difficulties were pointed out to Li during his recent inspection tour of the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), a private non-profit organisation founded in 2018 that is engaged in AI research and development, according to a report broadcast by state-run China Central Television (CCTV).\n\nRead more.\n\nIllustration: Lau Ka-kuen alt=Illustration: Lau Ka-kuen>\n\nAs tensions chip at Taiwan's 'silicon shield', semiconductor superiority may shift\n\nCross-Strait tensions are said to be chipping away at Taiwan's long-held dominance in the hi-tech industry where onshoring and reshoring efforts are becoming commonplace\n\nThreat of conflict with mainland China and sanctions from the West have industry on edge, underpinning a rapid diversification of semiconductor supply chains\n\nA sharp decline in Taiwan's ties with mainland China could extend to the very devices being used to transmit and read this story.\n\nThe far-reaching implications from what has been a geopolitical tug of war are ultimately likely to bolster mainland China's standing as a dominant supplier of older-model semiconductors while ramping up the need for Western allies to rely more on themselves for cutting-edge chips - a scenario that industry insiders say threatens to erode Taiwan's formidable \"silicon shield\" that has long afforded the island a privileged position in the global supply chain.\n\nRead more.\n\nGlobal Impact is a weekly curated newsletter featuring a news topic originating in China with a significant macro impact for our newsreaders around the world.\n\nSign up now!\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 20 Quietest Big Cities to Live in the US.\n\nLong-term exposure to noise pollution poses serious health risks for millions of individuals. According to the European Environmental Agency, 20% of Europe's population experiences noise pollution with severe health consequences. Data indicates that environmental noise contributes to 48,000 cases of ischemic heart disease annually and is responsible for approximately 12,000 premature deaths. Furthermore, an estimated 6.5 million people suffer from chronic sleep disturbances due to noise.\u00a0 It is also estimated that aircraft noise has negatively impacted the reading abilities of over 12,000 children.\n\nGlobally, noise-induced hearing loss affects about 5% of the population. A study conducted among traffic police in Hyderabad, India, revealed that around 76% of them suffer from noise-induced hearing loss. Meanwhile, in developed countries like the US, surveys show that about 6% of the population, particularly males, experience noise-induced hearing loss. These findings highlight the severe impact of noise pollution on public health worldwide.\n\nOverview: Noise Mitigation Market\n\nThe adverse effects of noise pollution have increased the demand for noise mitigation solutions to reduce its impact both outdoors and indoors. According to Global Market Insights, the Noise Mitigation Market reached a value of around $1.2 billion in 2022. The market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% from 2023 to 2032. In terms of regions, North America held the largest market share in 2022 at 36%.\n\nThe industry growth is being largely driven by government initiatives aimed at protecting public health from the negative effects of noise pollution, as well as increased production of sound mitigation products by companies such as Noise Barriers and Acoustiblok, Inc.\n\nFurthermore, online marketplaces like Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) also play an important role in increasing consumer access to soundproofing products like acoustic panel walls. Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) has been working on expanding its operations and achieving synergies across different divisions. The company recently hosted its 2024 results conference call.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) reported a total consolidated revenue of RMB 941 billion, reflecting an 8% growth. The consolidated adjusted EBITDA saw a 12% rise, reaching RMB 165 billion. Non-GAAP net income rose by 11%, amounting to RMB 157.5 billion. Furthermore, non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS experienced a 14% rise, supported by the company's ongoing share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) is the top stock recommended by billionaire David Tepper as of Q1 2024. For more of his stock picks, check out Top\u00a010\u00a0AI Stocks for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\n\nHere\u2019s what Artisan Partners said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares declined 7% during the quarter. There isn\u2019t much new to say about Alibaba. There was no meaningful news that drove the share price decline. The earnings for the December quarter were fine, with revenues and profits both increasing 5%\u2014not typically an exciting level of growth, but certainly enough to justify the company\u2019s paltry valuation of 4X\u20135X EBIT. As we have written in recent letters, this is a valuation level that is normally reserved for a dying business, and Alibaba is not a dying business. Management continues to implement changes that are intended to increase shareholder value. Over the past year, they have changed management, adjusted the company structure, contemplated spinning off assets, made progress monetizing the balance sheet and have improved the capital allocation. All of these actions have yet to be reflected at all in the share price. This is a stock that could double and would still be cheap.\u201d The Quietest Big City to Live in the US\n\nTyler Olson/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 quietest big cities to live in the US, we referred to the ArcGIS noise map viewer to collect information regarding the mean noise levels across cities.

        "content": "As the Federal Reserve maintains its benchmark interest rate, investors\u2019 focus sharpens on stocks with upside potential.\n\nWith limited room for movement in any direction, the stable rate sets the stage for a significant announcement later this week. It will reveal the Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook for possible rate cuts later this year. This moment provides an excellent chance for investors to strategically set up their portfolios to capitalize on companies expected to thrive during these times.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. labor market remains robust. Although the unemployment rate ticked up to 4%, the slight increase does not detract from its overall strength. This, coupled with continued job gains, adds to overall market stability. As we break down these economic indicators, understanding their interplay becomes critical for identifying investment possibilities with robust growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, these top three stocks with upside potential should be your go-to investments any day of the week.\n\nStocks With Upside Potential: Alibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is one of China\u2019s largest and most valuable companies. It is a leader in e-commerce and digital payments. Despite a tumultuous economic climate and a prolonged crackdown by Beijing authorities on digital enterprises, Alibaba has shown extraordinary resilience and managed to keep its footing.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s administration of China\u2019s key eCommerce sites, Tmall and Taobao, has been critical to expanding its market reach and cementing its supremacy. The firm posted solid quarterly performance, with Taobao and Tmall seeing a double-digit bump in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). Additionally, its foreign commerce revenue skyrocketed by 45%, while cloud revenue increased significantly, owing mostly to a triple-digit increase in AI-related sales.\n\nYet, with such compelling financial performance, shares of BABA currently trade at just 9.53 times forward earnings, a valuation that underscores the stock\u2019s potential for a comeback. This sentiment is echoed by TipRanks analysts, assigning Alibaba a Strong Buy rating with a remarkable 32% upside from its current value.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor companies have been bustling since generative AI took the world by storm in 2023. Among these, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) stole the spotlight. Specializing in supplying advanced equipment for chip manufacturing, ACMR has achieved notable breakthroughs. Particularly, its Frame Wafer Cleaning Tool worked wonders to enhance efficiency and remove contaminants. This growing influence of ACMR has led its stock to surge by 106% over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, ACMR performed exceptionally in its first quarter. The company reported a whopping 105% revenue increase, reaching $152.19 million, and operating income also jumped to $25.2 million from $8.9 million.

Though there has been choppiness in the crypto market lately, the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin remains firmly intact.\n\nFollowing these trends, Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), aBitcoin mining upstart, positions itself to capitalize on the underlying market dynamics.\n\nIt\u2019s not just its price, though, as Bitfarms has considerably raised its hashrate, demonstrating its dedication to growing its mining operation. In Q1 2024, Bitfarms achieved a 7.6% rise in its hashrate, reaching 7.0 EH/s from 6.5 EH/s sequentially. Furthermore, it\u2019s moving towards bigger goals, with the company intending to treble its hashrate to 21 EH/s by the end of 2024. This expansion points to a massive increase in mining activity in the upcoming quarters.\n\nFurthermore, with zero debt and $124 million in liquidity, Bitfarms is an excellent vehicle to ride the crypto market. TipRanks analysts reinforce this outlook by assigning Bitfarms a Strong Buy rating and predicting a staggering 66.7% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba BABA is constantly making efforts to strengthen its Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) offerings. The AIDC segment has been benefiting from the strong performance of platforms, including Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol and Alibaba.com.\r\n\r\nThe expanding partner base has been a key catalyst. Alibaba.com recently inked a partnership with UEFA EURO 2024 as the latter\u2019s official international business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce provider.\r\n\r\nAlibaba\u2019s international e-commerce retail arm, AliExpress, was also recently named the exclusive global e-commerce partner of UEFA EURO 2024.\r\n\r\nAs part of the deal, Alibaba.com will launch several initiatives to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), offering deals, giveaways and advanced sourcing tools to boost sales, particularly for soccer-related merchandise.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nStrengthening AIDC Segment Aids Prospects\n\nAlibaba is expected to gain more popularity among SMEs in Europe on the back of the UEFA partnership. Alibaba.com has been taking initiatives to boost its footprint among SMEs. Recently, Alibaba.com introduced the Alibaba Guaranteed platform for global SMEs. The platform simplifies B2B cross-border trade for SMEs by offering supply chain reliability.\r\n\r\nIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, the AIDC segment generated RMB 27.45 billion ($3.8 billion) in revenues, exhibiting year-over-year growth of 45%.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is keeping no stone unturned to make AliExpress a success. It created synergies between AliExpress and the cross-border logistics operations of Cainiao to bolster AliExpress\u2019 5-day and 10-day delivery services. BABA also increased investments in key markets to enhance customer experience, expand consumer base and strengthen AliExpress\u2019 market position globally.\n\nAlibaba Suffers From Stiff Competition\n\nAlibaba has been expanding its footprint in the global e-commerce market through several initiatives including the UEFA partnership and expansion of AliExpress offerings. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThe e-commerce market, as per a report from Statista, is anticipated to generate revenues of 4.12 trillion in 2024. The figure is expected to hit $6.48 trillion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 9.5% over 2024-2029. This presents a significant growth opportunity for Alibaba.\r\n\r\nHowever, competitive pressure, coupled with rising expenses related to new initiatives, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations, poses a serious risk for the company.\r\n\r\nAlibaba faces stiff competition from industry peers like Amazon AMZN, eBay EBAY and JD.com JD, which are also making concerted efforts to strengthen their foothold in the global e-commerce market.\r\n\r\nAmazon has been at the forefront of the e-commerce market on the back of its strong Prime momentum, robust distribution strength, expanding fulfillment network and growing relationships with third-party sellers.\r\n\r\neBay, on the other hand, is making concerted efforts to support sellers, further solidifying its position in the e-commerce space. Its launch of a mobile consignment concierge, the Luxe Line, to offer a convenient selling experience by allowing visitors in Los Angeles and Las Vegas to directly access expert sellers listing and selling luxury items remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nJD.com expanded its international express delivery service from Guangzhou and Shenzhen to nearly every district in China, boosting its popularity among SMEs. The service offers efficient logistics solutions for various products, including documents and apparel, among others, with the United States, the U.K. and Germany as top destinations.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlibaba\u2019s shares have returned 1.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 15.5%. BABA\u2019s shares have underperformed Amazon, eBay and JD.com\u2019s growth of 21.3%, 23% and 4.4%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable estimate revision reflects rising competitive pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.20 per share, indicating a 4.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The figure has decreased by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 total revenues stands at $138.63 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.2%.\r\n\r\nDespite stiff competition, Alibaba is benefiting from strong momentum across its international commerce retail business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses and strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice are contributing well. Growing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trading at a significant discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 9.34X compared with the industry\u2019s 25.25X.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There isn\u2019t much new to say about Alibaba. There was no meaningful news that drove the share price decline. The earnings for the December quarter were fine, with revenues and profits both increasing 5%\u2014not typically an exciting level of growth, but certainly enough to justify the company\u2019s paltry valuation of 4X\u20135X EBIT. As we have written in recent letters, this is a valuation level that is normally reserved for a dying business, and Alibaba is not a dying business. Management continues to implement changes that are intended to increase shareholder value. Over the past year, they have changed management, adjusted the company structure, contemplated spinning off assets, made progress monetizing the balance sheet and have improved the capital allocation. All of these actions have yet to be reflected at all in the share price. This is a stock that could double and would still be cheap.\"\n\nAn e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is in 23rd position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "content": "Chinese autonomous driving firm Minieye Technology, backed by Alibaba Group Holding CEO Eddy Wu Yongming, has submitted to go public on the Hong Kong stock exchange, becoming the latest mainland self-driving tech firm looking to float on the city's bourse.\n\nThe company had gone through at least 17 rounds of fundraising before submitting its prospectus on May 27. It is looking to raise US$150 million, the International Financial Review reported. The company has not revealed a target valuation, saying only that it has exceeded the HK$4 billion (US$512 million) market capitalisation required at the time of listing.\n\nWu - a co-founder of Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post - is among the company's most high-profile backers. He holds a 2.3 per cent stake in the company, after transferring shares valued at 30.6 million (US$4.2 million) yuan in 2019, four years after his 4.5 million yuan angel investment, according to the prospectus.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Handout alt=A Minieye Technology display at the Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition in 2023. Photo: Handout>\n\nThe start-up's corporate backers include investment houses such as Beijing Siwei Management, Shenzhen Zeyi, and China International Capital.\n\nFounded in 2014 by entrepreneur Liu Guoqing, who earned a PhD in computer science from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in 2013, Minieye has supported 29 carmakers with autonomous driving solutions up to Level 2 - meaning the system is able to control steering and acceleration but requires driver monitoring, similar to Tesla's Autopilot.\n\nLast year, Minieye sold more than 780 million of its intelligent driving solutions.\n\nCompany revenue reached 476 million yuan last year, growing at a compounded annual rate of 64.9 per cent over three years. Revenues were 279 million yuan and 175 million yuan in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nHowever, the company has yet to turn a profit after a decade in operation. It saw 139 million yuan in losses last year, an improvement over the 221 million yuan and 207 million yuan lost in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAs the company prepares to go public, it has been reducing research and development expenditures as a proportion of revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 150 million yuan it spent on R&D last year was up nearly 8 per cent from the 139 million yuan spent the year before, falling to 31.5 per cent of revenue compared with 49.9 per cent in 2022. R&D spending was 82.2 million yuan in 2021, or 46.9 per cent of revenue, according to the prospectus.\n\nHong Kong has proven to be an attractive destination for autonomous driving firms on the mainland looking to gain access to international markets. iMotion Automotive Technology, based in Suzhou just west of Shanghai, was the first Chinese automated driving company to list on the Hong Kong exchange in December.\n\nSince then, other related firms in the world's largest car market have looked south for their initial public offerings. These include Beijing-based Horizon Robotics, autonomous driving chip maker Black Sesame Technologies and Shanghai-based Zongmu Technology.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Warren Buffett still lives in the house he bought 66 years ago. Walmart founder Sam Walton drove a pickup truck instead of an expensive luxury car. Wipro founder Azim Premji often flies in economy class.\n\nNot every super-wealthy person foregoes spending lavishly. However, many of the richest individuals on the planet like to get a good value for their money. This sometimes shows up in their investing activity. Billionaires are buying these three undervalued stocks. Should you?\n\n1. Alibaba Group Holding\n\nDavid Tepper's net worth is $20.6 billion. The hedge fund he founded in 1993, Appaloosa Management, now primarily manages Tepper's own money. Tepper and Appaloosa have bet heavily on one undervalued stock -- Alibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA).\n\nAlibaba ranks as Appaloosa's top holding. In the first quarter of 2024, Tepper upped his hedge fund's position in the Chinese tech company by nearly 159%. And he's not the only billionaire investor scooping up more shares of Alibaba.\n\nKen Griffin is worth a whopping $37.5 billion. His hedge fund, Citadel, increased its stake in Alibaba by almost 27% in Q1.\n\nWhy are these billionaires buying Alibaba hand over fist? The stock's valuation is almost certainly a key factor. Alibaba trades at a forward earnings multiple of slightly over 9.5. That's dirt cheap for a tech stock.\n\n2. PayPal Holdings\n\nTepper doesn't own any shares of PayPal Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL). However, Griffin does. And he increased Citadel's position in the stock by nearly 182% in Q1.\n\nAnother billionaire investor also developed a newfound interest in PayPal. Paul Tudor Jones, II, whose net worth is $8.1 billion, initiated a new position in the fintech company in Q1 for his Tudor Investment Holdings hedge fund.\n\nPayPal stock is down nearly 80% below its high set in mid-2021. Its shares trade at only 15 times forward earnings, much lower than the S&P 500 index's forward earnings multiple of 21.2.\n\n3. Verizon Communications\n\nBillionaire Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund has a sizable position in Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) but hasn't added to its stake recently. It's a different story for Griffin and his Citadel fund, though. Citadel bought more than 6.2 million shares of Verizon in Q1, boosting its stake in the telecom giant by nearly 254%.\n\nVerizon's share price remains well below its late 2019 peak. However, the stock has performed well over the last 12 months, jumping more than 20%. Roughly half of that gain came this year.\n\nI suspect Griffin was attracted in part by Verizon's valuation. Its shares trade at roughly 9 times forward earnings. That's less than half the forward earnings multiple of the S&P 500 communications services sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you buy these undervalued stocks, too?\n\nInvestors who aren't billionaires could find much to like with these three stocks. However, they're not ideal picks for every investing style.\n\nAlibaba, PayPal, and Verizon might appeal to value investors. Growth investors could be intrigued by PayPal's prospects but probably won't be overly excited about Alibaba and Verizon.\n\nIncome investors won't waste their time on PayPal since the company doesn't offer a dividend. They could also turn up their noses at Alibaba, which has a low forward dividend yield of under 1.3%. On the other hand, income investors should love Verizon with its ultra-high forward dividend yield of over 6.4%.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Alibaba\u2019s BABA international business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce arm, Alibaba.com, introduced Alibaba Guaranteed for global small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\r\n\r\nAlibaba Guaranteed is a platform that simplifies B2B cross-border trade for SMEs by offering supply chain reliability. It provides secure sourcing of products at fixed prices, with guaranteed delivery within 72 hours.\r\n\r\nThe platform also offers after-sales services, quick money back and free local returns, facilitating buyers.\r\n\r\nAlibaba has added strength to its global logistics services on the back of its latest launch. This, in turn, will aid Alibaba in gaining solid momentum across SMEs in the United States and around the globe by helping these businesses expand their global reach.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the launch of Alibaba Guaranteed will strengthen its Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) segment\u2019s performance, which is currently the key growth driver of the company.\r\n\r\nThe AIDC segment, which comprises Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Alibaba.com and other businesses operating in the international retail and wholesale markets, generated RMB 27.45 billion ($3.8 billion) in revenues, exhibiting year-over-year growth of 45%.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nStrengthening Logistics Services Boost Prospects\n\nPer an EMR report, the global logistics market is expected to reach $18.35 trillion by 2032, indicating a CAGR of 6.3% between 2024 and 2032. Alibaba is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity on the back of its expanding global logistics services.\r\n\r\nAlibaba launched an affordable logistics solution, namely Logistics Marketplace, for SMEs in the United States. The new solution offers a point-of-contact for buyers and pre-vetted logistics service providers, enabling businesses to offer tailored solutions to their target customers.\r\n\r\nThis service is meant to reshape the supply chain strategies of various enterprises and reduce traditional logistics hurdles.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the company\u2019s logistics arm, Cainiao, announced the launch of a \"consolidated shipping\" service in the United States, bolstering its overseas logistics offerings.\r\n\r\nThe cross-border service packages multiple shopping orders from various Chinese e-commerce platforms and delivers them to U.S. customers via air and sea transport routes, reducing delivery times to as little as five days.\r\n\r\nStrengthening logistics services globally will likely bolster the company\u2019s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 total revenues stands at $138.63 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.2%.\r\n\r\nHowever, competitive pressure, rising expenses related to new initiatives, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations, pose a serious risk for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAlibaba\u2019s shares have returned 3.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s gain of 8.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario in the Logistics Space\n\nAlibaba faces stiff competition in the logistics space against the likes of Amazon AMZN, JD.com JD and eBay EBAY, which are also making strong efforts to bolster their logistics services.\r\n\r\nBABA has also underperformed AMZN, JD and EBAY\u2019s growth of 21.8%, 6% and 23.7%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.\r\n\r\nAmazon\u2019s end-to-end supply chain service called \"Supply Chain by Amazon\" remains noteworthy. It allows third-party sellers to pick up inventory, ship across borders, handle customs clearance, store bulk inventory and deliver to customers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, JD.com announced that its logistics arm, JD Logistics, expanded its international express delivery service from Guangzhou and Shenzhen to nearly every district in China. The service offers efficient logistics solutions for various products, including documents and apparel, among others, with the United States, the U.K. and Germany as top destinations.\r\n\r\neBay, on the other hand, gains solid momentum across its International Shipping Program. This service allows buyers outside the U.S. to purchase items listed on eBay.com, including parcel processing, shipping costs and customs clearance services, through third-party service providers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe appearance of big-name entrepreneurs on live-streaming platforms has been a hot topic in China recently. Xiaomi founder Lei Jun recently held two live-streaming sessions in the past two months, and e-commerce firm JD.com has been hosting live streams of an AI-powered digital avatar of its founder Richard Liu since April.\n\nBeauty blogger Austin Li Jiaqi, seen live-streaming on Taobao on October 26, 2018, has become one of the biggest stars in the live-streaming e-commerce space.

Photo: VCG/VCG via Getty Images>\n\nTaobao first launched similar services catering to celebrities and social media influencers in February. It underscores efforts in recent months from Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, to find new growth opportunities in a domestic market where it faces heightened competition from PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo and ByteDance's Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok that has been pushing into e-commerce.\n\nIn May, Alibaba announced a makeover for the Taobao website in what was the platform's biggest update in seven years. It simplifies the site's layout with smoother performance as the company seeks to offer a better shopping experience. It also expanded web access of its live streams to include all sessions.\n\nAlibaba is in the middle of its latest sales campaign for the 618 shopping festival - China's second-largest shopping extravaganza behind Singles' Day - in which major e-commerce players compete fiercely through steep discounts, cash subsidies and colourful marketing campaigns. Ostensibly a sales event meant for June 18, Alibaba kicked off sales this year on May 20 and will run them through June 20.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaobao Live has so far coaxed nearly 100 celebrities to start live-streaming for the 618 event, with most using the new one-stop service, according to data from Taobao and Tmall Group.\n\nFrom May 20 to May 31, 38 live-streaming rooms on the platform - including one featuring China's top beauty influencer Austin Li Jiaqi - each achieved a turnover of more than 100 million yuan (US$13.8 million), which the company said is a record for the period.\n\nHalf of these rooms were hosted by influencers such as Li, while the other half came from brands like Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi.\n\nFor many, live-streaming rooms have become the new shopping channel, with consumers using them to learn more about products they want before hitting the buy button.\n\nMichelle Feng, a woman living in the eastern city of Suzhou, said a purchase she made during Li's session was the first she ever made through a live stream. Feng spent more than 100 yuan on cosmetics after accidentally stumbling upon the live stream this week.\n\n\"It didn't take me long to make the order, because I believe in the products that he recommended,\" Feng said. \"Li himself is a brand.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding, the e-commerce giant that is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence (AI), has updated its open-source AI models with claims of besting Meta Platforms' Llama 3 model in certain tasks.\n\nAlibaba Cloud on Friday launched Qwen2 - the second iteration of its open-source Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models (LLM), the technology behind chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT - with a series of updates including multilingual pre-training and an expanded the context window. That means it now allows for much longer queries and answers, putting in it the league of the world's most powerful open source LLMs.\n\nQwen2 comes in five variations. The high-end Qwen2-72B model consistently offered better results than Meta's Llama 3-70B - the strongest open-source AI model from the Facebook owner - in various benchmark tests, according to Alibaba. Tests include maths, coding, natural and social sciences, engineering and the humanities, the company said in a post published to the model's official GitHub page.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAlibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, has launched Qwen2 just one month after unveiling Tongyi Qianwen 2.5, which is closed source. The company said at the time that model performs better in various Chinese capabilities than GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced model, which is also closed source.\n\nThe five variations of Alibaba's Qwen2, from the more nimble Qwen2-0.5B to its most sophisticated Qwen2-72B, have between 490 million and 72.7 billion parameters. They are also trained on 27 languages, in addition to Chinese and English: nine from Europe, four from the Middle East, and 14 from Asia.\n\nThe rapid follow-up launch of a new AI model, with capabilities matching leading global models, reflects the confidence that the Chinese firm has in funnelling an increasing amount of resources into an AI race that has engulfed much of the tech industry.\n\nMany other Chinese companies, from the biggest tech giants to myriad start-ups, have been forging ahead in their own LLM development efforts, recently igniting a domestic price war.\n\nShenzhen-based social media and video gaming giant Tencent Holdings announced its own dedicated chatbot in late May called Yuanbao, backed by the company's latest Hunyuan LLM. Tencent said its home-grown model has gone through a series of enhancements since its launch last September.\n\nStory continues\n\nHunyuan has been baked into more than 600 business scenarios across Tencent's organisations, as it aims to use AI to help boost efficiency. Alibaba is also looking to leverage AI to help transform businesses.\n\nAlibaba.com, the e-commerce giant's business-to-business cross-border sourcing platform, has recently introduced its own AI-powered tools to help connect sellers and buyers to boost sales, Zhang Kuo, the platform's president, told the Post in a recent interview.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Chinese tech stocks are a cohort that has been shunned by many investors. Many of these investors have been hurt buying the dip. More descriptively, they were hurt by reaching out to catch the falling knife). Undoubtedly, truly beaten-down Chinese internet stocks may struggle to sustain an explosive rally that brings forth new highs. Chinese internet stocks have lost more than 70% of their value from all-time highs,\n\nThe path behind doesn\u2019t quite matter as much for investors as the path that could lie ahead. This is true given potential catalysts unique to specific Chinese firms. You should also consider the magnitude of growth that could be in the cards if China\u2019s economy can power higher again.\n\nEconomic contractions happen every now and often. Particularly nasty ones may cause investors to give up on entire geographies or asset classes. Think abouthow many people ditched cryptocurrencies during the great bust of 2022?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf Chinese stocks appeal to you and you\u2019re willing to take heightened risks, perhaps the following Chinese tech stocks are worth considering. These are beginning showing signs of life.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese e-commerce firm that\u2019s seen sales growth really stall in recent years. At writing, the stock is still down over 71% from its 2021 all-time high north of $106.\n\nThe company\u2019s first quarter of 2024 saw progress in sales growth, up 7%, and profitability. However, the firm isn\u2019t close to being out of the woods. Margins are taking a hit from investments in operations and forward-looking technologies as a ton of goods hit the digital discount racks.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not going to be easy to navigate a harsh economic climate while fending off strengthening rivals. The most notable rival is PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), the firm behind Temu.\n\nIn any case, I do think so much negativity has already been priced into JD stock already. The stock goes for just 13.48 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That\u2019s too low of a price for a firm that could gain should things go right for a change.\n\nNetEase (NTES) netease (NTES) logo on a mobile phone screen representing earnings reports\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) is a video gaming firm that\u2019s a must-own for investors looking for exposure to the fast-growing mobile gaming market. In China, mobile gaming is big, and such gamers are ready to spend big bucks on everything from in-game cosmetics (or skins) to loot boxes.\n\nAt writing, NTES stock is fresh off a nasty fall, now down around 17% from its past-month high of $106 and change. Indeed, quarterly results may have missed the mark, but that\u2019s no reason to give up on the firm as it readies for new games and expansion packs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s latest 2024 annual product launch event was packed. I have no doubt that such a robust pipeline of content will incentivize many gamers to open up their wallets.\n\nOf course, the gaming market is fiercely competitive. There are so many must-play titles and so little time to enjoy them all to their fullest. At just 13.54 times trailing P/E, NTES stock stands out as one of the cheapest gaming plays on the planet. With this consistency you can see why this is one of the top Chinese tech stocks.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Chinese internet juggernaut that\u2019s been \u201cdead money\u201d since its short-lived spike back in late 2020 and early 2021. Since the bubbly move collapsed, it hasn\u2019t been all too rewarding to be a shareholder in BIDU stock. Just because the five-year chart is unimpressive, though, doesn\u2019t mean Baidu is a name to count out, especially while it\u2019s trading for just 14.68 times trailing P/E.\n\nRecently, the stock sunk to fresh 52-week lows below $95 per share. The company is cutting prices on its cloud services, just like fellow Chinese tech titan Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA). Lower cloud prices are the last thing Baidu needed with sluggish advertising revenues recently posted in its recent first quarter. Still, if Alibaba makes a drastic move, all rivals must follow, or sales could dry up rapidly.\n\nOn the plus side, Baidu is betting big on its generative AI model, Ernie. Management is \u201cconfident\u201d that AI will be a meaningful driver of earnings over the longer term.\n\nAs the chatbot scene gets crowded, though, it\u2019s tough to see how Baidu can differentiate itself. Either way, BIDU stock\u2019s admission price is so low that investors should watch the name closely if they seek AI stocks going for cheaper than most \u201cboring\u201d value plays in the U.S. If you are looking for the top Chinese tech stocks, start with this one.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NEW YORK, June 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Alibaba.com, a leading platform for global business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce and part of Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, today announced the official launch of Alibaba Guaranteed to help simplify global sourcing and provide a more flexible and reliable supply chain for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the U.S. and beyond. Alibaba.com logo (PRNewsfoto/Alibaba.com)\n\nAlibaba.com now serves more than 48 million SMEs buyers, with more than 200,000 suppliers on its platform worldwide. Through Alibaba Guaranteed, buyers will be able to source with added confidence as the service offers products at fixed prices with shipping fees included, promises dispatch of goods within 72 hours, and guarantees delivery by the expected date. Buyers can also take advantage of after-sales services, such as quick money back for order issues and free local returns for defects.\n\nProducts sourced through this new solution will be fulfilled by Alibaba.com, providing buyers with order security. Additionally, the platform handles finance, such as escrow and payment terms, and after-sales services, allowing both buyers greater ability to focus on their products.\n\n\"Alibaba Guaranteed marks an exciting new chapter for SMEs and global sourcing as it will help to redefine the fulfillment standard of B2B cross-border trade,\" said Kuo Zhang, President of Alibaba.com. \"Global sourcing can be a complex process with many moving parts, but Alibaba Guaranteed can help SMEs navigate it with greater ease. With much of the leg work being done for SMEs by the platform, cross-border trade can be as simple as purchasing a pair of shoes from your favorite retailer online.\"\n\nThis offering comes at a time when SMEs are increasingly looking for online sourcing solutions. In fact, a recent Alibaba.com survey showed that two-thirds (66%) of SMEs plan to increase their reliance on online global sourcing in 2024. However, delivery time, logistics costs and worries of not receiving products emerged as the top three main concerns for engaging in cross-border sourcing, with up to 22% of respondents ranking them as their top challenges. Alibaba Guaranteed was developed to help address concerns like these.\n\nAlibaba.com remains dedicated to innovating across the sourcing and supply chain spaces to help SMEs expand and gain greater footing on the global e-commerce stage. Alibaba Guaranteed with fulfillment by Alibaba.com represents the latest upgrade furthering its support of businesses in the U.S. and across the globe.\n\nFor more information on Alibaba.com and Alibaba Guaranteed, please visit https://www.alibaba.com/.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout\u00a0Alibaba.com Launched in 1999 as Alibaba Group's first business, Alibaba.com is a leading platform for global business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce that serves buyers and suppliers from over 200 countries and regions around the world.

        "content": "Alibaba.com, a business-to-business (B2B) cross-border e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group Holding, is projecting US$60 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) for 2024, which would be a 20 per cent increase over the US$50 billion last year, the platform's president Zhang Kuo said.\n\nThe sourcing platform's turnover growth slowed after a sevenfold increase in GMV over the previous five years, Zhang told the South China Morning Post in an interview in Hong Kong on Thursday.\n\n\"It's quite hard to double GMV every single year due to an increasingly large base,\" he said. \"The core issue is about the business model, as we need to make new breakthroughs and transformations.\"\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Edmond So alt=Alibaba.com president Zhang Kuo attends the Greenwich Economic Forum in Central on June 6, 2024. Photo: Edmond So>\n\nAlibaba.com started in 1999 as an online yellow book to help overseas bulk buyers find Chinese manufacturers. It is now largely functioning as a transaction platform that directly links Chinese suppliers with foreign businesses. Alibaba.com is part of Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, one of the growth engines for Alibaba Group, the owner of South China Morning Post.\n\nChinese merchants on the platform saw the combined value of their exports reach US$350 billion last year, or roughly 10 per cent of the value of all Chinese exports, which increased 7 per cent in 2023 to US$3.6 trillion.\n\nAlibaba.com has more than 200,000 suppliers, 90 per cent of whom are based in China. Half of the products offered on the platform are not for consumer use, according to Zhang. These include machinery tools, construction materials, laser cutting devices and even small food trucks.\n\n\"The turnover of non-consumer goods is growing faster than consumer goods,\" he said.\n\nWhile China-backed shopping apps such as Temu, owned by Alibaba rival PDD Holdings, are quickly winning overseas consumers, Alibaba.com is betting on growing demand for small businesses to source online.\n\n\"Actually there's no major direct competition with Temu or TikTok,\" Zhang said, referring to the ByteDance-owned short video platform's recent push into e-commerce. \"They are affecting a lot of the traditional small retailers in overseas markets ... but we believe in the importance of local ecosystems.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba also runs a number of consumer-facing apps, including Lazada and AliExpress.\n\nOn Thursday, Alibaba.com announced the launch of Alibaba Guaranteed, a service designed to make B2B sourcing as easy as shopping on sites like Amazon.com. Through the service, products will be offered at fixed prices with shipping fees included and guaranteed delivery times.\n\nFor sellers, the service is similar to a model known as \"half-custody\", in which suppliers outsource shipping, delivery, payment and client services to the platform. Zhang said lowering the barrier to foreign trade encourages Chinese merchants to directly pursue foreign buyers, as these companies typically do not have the ability to deal with complicated cross-border trade procedures themselves.\n\nIn Yiwu, a city in eastern Zhejiang province known for small manufacturers, the number of Alibaba.com clients increased 70 per cent in the last two quarters.\n\nAlibaba.com has also been rolling out artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as an on-site chatbot to help exporters.\n\nLast October, it introduced an AI tool to help users display goods online and to manage correspondence with clients. The tool's annual recurring revenue has reached US$100 million, according to Zhang.\n\nIn July, the platform will launch an AI tool to help buyers find the right products.\n\n\"As long as you have an idea, an intention, or a picture, we can help you to find the right merchants to make the right products,\" Zhang said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks Wall Street Might Be Sleeping On, but I'm Not",
        "content": "Most of the time, Wall Street gets it right. That is to say, the market usually knows what's important to know about a company, and appropriately reflects this information in that stock's price. These values, of course, can and do change every day. However, these changes mostly reflect new information or new perceptions regarding a stock's risks.\n\nEvery now and then, though, Wall Street -- analysts and investors alike -- can miss the mark. More to the point, \"the Street\" doesn't fully see a company's potential and therefore undervalues that company's shares. This creates opportunities for astute investors that see the bigger picture.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three great growth stocks that Wall Street might be sleeping on, but I'm not.\n\n1. Roblox\n\nIt hasn't been an easy past few weeks for Roblox(NYSE: RBLX) shareholders. The stock tumbled early last month, mostly in response to disappointing guidance for the fiscal quarter now underway. Namely, the video gaming platform's expectation for second-quarter bookings of between $870 million and $900 million was below estimates; the company also lowered its full-year guidance. Thanks to that single day's sell-off, the stock is now down 27% from February's high. That's despite the slight rebound since the post-earnings pullback. Investors are worried about what looks like a slowdown stemming from economic weakness.\n\nHowever, this doubt misses a couple of important realities regarding Roblox.\n\nFirst, although the company's internal outlook wasn't quite up to external expectations, Roblox is still doing incredibly well. Last quarter's top line was up 22% year over year, beating analysts' consensus figure. It's still in the red as well, but last quarter's loss was also less than expected. Sure, revenue and bookings growth is anticipated to slow down for the remainder of this year and the next. Based on its recent past, however, it's arguable the company's near-term future will be brighter than currently believed.\n\nSecond, while its roots are in the online video-gaming arena, Roblox is branching out. Last month, it widened the test launch of its in-game advertising platform, which shows paid-for billboards within the virtual worlds its users visit. These ads can even directly generate a real-world sale of a good or service. At the same time, the company's tech can create virtual worlds for brands that want to offer an immersive metaverse experience for existing and prospective customers. Nike, Walmart, and the beauty brand Fenty are just some of the names that are now engaging consumers through Roblox's platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven Precedence Research's prediction that the metaverse market is set to grow at an annualized clip of 38% through 2033, Roblox shareholders have much to look forward to. It's just going to take some time for all of its upside to be fully realized.\n\n2. Ulta Beauty\n\nThese are tricky times for cosmetics and beauty-supply retailers. Department stores and general merchandise stores, once the industry's top destination for these goods, are losing their share of total foot traffic. Consumers are also more willing to try new, less mainstream brands and venues than they've been using in the past, which they're often finding online. These brands are also willing and able to sell directly to customers, bypassing retailers as middlemen altogether.\n\nUlta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) has seemingly defied if not outright benefited from the industry's evolution, however.\n\nIf you're not familiar with it, $20 billion makeup and beauty retailer Ulta does on the order of $12 billion worth of business per year, combining a strong online and offline presence. There are nearly 1,400 stores encompassing 14.6 million square feet worth of shopping space peppered all across the United States. The retailer handles a wide range of brand names, including Clinique, e.l.f., Mad Hippie, and Fur, just to name a few. Being able to offer this deep mix of goods and brands is a key reason it's done so well in a challenging environment; Ulta is the chief disruptor because it delivers consumers what they want, the way they want it -- a wide selection and convenient shopping options at a fair price.\n\nAdmittedly, Ulta Beauty stretches the definition of what's considered a growth stock. Its top-line growth is projected to remain in the single digits for at least the next several years. Chalk it up to the highly saturated market. The company underscored this competitive concern just a few days ago, too, by dialing back its full-year revenue outlook from a range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion to a lower range of only $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, ultimately pointing to the toll that the aforementioned economic malaise is taking on consumer spending. Even its competitive edge isn't quite enough right now.\n\nThis headwind was already factored into the stock's price, though. Ulta Beauty's shares are now 30% below March's high, 20% below analysts' consensus price target of $495.06, and trading at only around 15 times this year's expected per-share earnings of between $25.20 and $26.00. That's a bargain price, no matter how you look at it.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nLast but not least, add China's e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) to your list of growth stocks that Wall Street just isn't giving its due respect.\n\nAnyone keeping tabs on Alibaba (parent to e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall) likely knows the past few years have been miserable ones for stockholders. Although it obviously benefited from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the stock's price peaked in late 2020. Beijing began a sweeping regulatory crackdown in mid-2021, which didn't ease until the middle of this year. Even then, China's heavy-handed pandemic-prompted lockdowns held in place through late 2022 ended up doing more lingering damage to its economy than was foreseen.\n\nIn the meantime, the company itself seems to be struggling with self-management. Just since November, Alibaba has canceled its once-touted plans to spin off its cloud computing business as well as its logistics arm. The surprising plan reversals are a key reason shares haven't budged since the middle of 2022, and are still down 75% from their 2020 high.\n\nTake a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. Things are getting better.\n\nTake China's economy as an example. Challenges aside, the International Monetary Fund still contends that the country's GDP is going to grow by 5% this year. Consumer spending is healthy there, too. Beijing reports a 2.3% year-over-year improvement in April's retail sales. While that's not huge, any improvement on the April 2023 growth rate of 18.4% is impressive. Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao are particularly well positioned to capture more than their fair share of this spending growth. Mordor Intelligence says China's e-commerce market is set to grow at an annualized rate of more than 11% through 2029.\n\nThe company still has much to figure out, like which businesses it wants to be in and which ones it doesn't. Although it's sticking with its cloud computing and logistics operations right now, Alibaba is still restructuring, including replacing several key members of its management team. It's very much a work in progress.\n\nThe progress it's making is actually progressive, though, taking care of matters and refocusing the company in a way that remains underestimated by most investors. This is the overhaul that should have been underway prior to the pandemic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "7 Deeply Undervalued Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Later",
        "content": "If you screen some of the top stocks on the market today, you\u2019ll realize they were among some of the most deeply undervalued stocks at some point in the past decade. Most people looking at their charts now wish they were one of the contrarians who bought these stocks when they were trading at bargain-basement prices.\n\nThere are many deeply undervalued stocks on the market today, and most of them are actually profitable companies with a very long history and great staying power. Buying these stocks before the market cycle shifts is a good idea, and the recovery could boost your portfolio gains significantly. Here are seven such deeply undervalued stocks to look into.\n\nSix Flags Entertainment (SIX) Customers riding a rollercoaster at a Six Flags park in Maryland.\n\nSource: Cvandyke / Shutterstock\n\nSix Flags Entertainment (NYSE:SIX) operates regional theme parks across North America. The stock has been mired in a brutal downtrend since 2018, with the pandemic delivering a crushing blow that it\u2019s still recovering from. However, I believe brighter days lie ahead as travel demand resurges. In Q1, Six Flags\u2019 season pass sales jumped double-digits, with both unit sales and average prices rising. Group sales have also rebounded over 20% year-over-year, nearing pre-COVID levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMost encouraging, in-park spending per guest climbed 5% when excluding discontinued memberships, driving record Q1 in-park revenues. Management\u2019s \u201cpremiumization\u201d strategy of enhancing park offerings and infrastructure seems to resonate as guests stay longer and spend more. Rising EPS should also lift the stock in the long run. Deeply undervalued stocks: Six Flags Entertainment EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI believe Six Flags\u2019 attendance and margins can keep recovering as interest rates eventually ease and consumer discretionary spending picks up. For patient investors, this battered stock could deliver meaningful upside.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) provides mobile payment solutions for businesses and individuals. The company delivered impressive Q1 results, beating on both the top and bottom lines with EPS of 85 cents and revenue growth of over 19% YOY to $5.96 billion.\n\nWhile Block was often viewed as a high-growth but unprofitable alternative to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), I believe the stock is deeply undervalued and poised for a sharp recovery. The recent pullback in shares alongside other fintech names misrepresents Block\u2019s robust fundamentals.\n\nBlock has not only turned the profitability corner, but also maintained strong double-digit top-line momentum. Analysts expect 14% revenue growth for 2024 and expect EPS to skyrocket from $3.40 this year to $15 by 2033. It\u2019ll be very hard for the market not to reward the profitability.\n\nStory continues Block EPS chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nBlock looks like a compelling buy trading at these beaten-down levels.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is one of China\u2019s largest tech giants, and I believe the stock is a screaming buy at these depressed levels. The broader Chinese market has been struggling, but there are clear signs of a recovery as the government eases monetary policy. Alibaba reported robust results this quarter, with its core Taobao and Tmall businesses achieving double-digit GMV growth. International commerce revenue surged 45%, and cloud revenue saw strong double-digit gains, driven by triple-digit growth in AI-related sales.\n\nI\u2019m confident Alibaba will outperform going forward as it slashes cloud service prices to boost adoption. With China\u2019s vast data industry unlikely to rely on foreign tech, Alibaba is perfectly positioned to dominate this market for years to come. Management expects a gradual return to healthy GMV growth in fiscal 2025 as the shopping experience improves. While new monetization products won\u2019t launch until the second half, I believe Alibaba\u2019s investments in pricing, supply, and service will pay off hugely in the long run. Analysts also see solid upside. BABA price forecast\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIt is definitely one of the most deeply undervalued stocks at these levels.\n\nBaxter International (BAX) The logo for Baxter International Inc (BAX) is displayed on an office building.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBaxter International (NYSE:BAX) is a leading global medical products company. I believe Baxter is a deeply undervalued stock poised for significant upside. The healthcare industry is booming due to an aging population, new drug innovations, and increasing health challenges. Baxter is well-positioned to benefit from these tailwinds in the long term.\n\nIn Q1, Baxter delivered solid results, beating on both revenue and EPS. Sales grew 3% in constant currency, driven by broad-based demand and pricing strength. Margin improvement initiatives are also gaining traction. Baxter\u2019s essential product portfolio and newly streamlined operating model provide durability and strategic clarity.\n\nThe stock has been unfairly punished, down 61% from 2020 highs. But at these levels, the downside appears limited, with considerable recovery potential. Baxter International price\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nBaxter also offers an attractive 3.4% dividend yield.\n\nWhile the Healthcare Systems & Technology segment underperformed, I\u2019m encouraged by the recent FDA clearance of Baxter\u2019s next-gen Novum IQ infusion pump platform. As hospitals upgrade aging equipment, this should drive growth.\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) Cruise ship Carnival Conquest docked at port Willemstad on sunset. Cruise stocks.\n\nSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) is a cruise travel company. I believe Carnival stock is deeply undervalued and poised for a significant recovery. The company delivered record revenues, bookings, and customer deposits in Q1, with yields increasing over 17% YOY. Carnival is capturing more new guests than ever.\n\nThe stock is still down 66% from pre-pandemic levels but has climbed 30% in the past year as the cruise industry rebounds. With the Fed signaling potential rate cuts ahead, Carnival seems primed to benefit, given its hefty debt load. Lower interest rates would ease the burden of interest payments and free up more cash flow. It should easily return to positive margins as rates come down. How Carnival makes its money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAs people flood into cruise-heavy markets like Florida, Carnival should see a surge in bookings and pricing. Management is already pulling the booking curve forward to support higher overall pricing. I expect Carnival to sail towards much smoother waters, but it is currently one of the most deeply undervalued stocks, at least in my eyes.\n\nFMC Corporation (FMC) A magnifying glass zooms in on the FMC Corporation (FMC) website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nFMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) makes crop protection products. The stock has plummeted by nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023, but I believe there\u2019s a compelling case for a turnaround. While Q1 revenue missed expectations due to ongoing channel destocking, the long-term outlook remains promising.\n\nGrowers have delayed purchases to manage bloated inventories, temporarily crushing demand. However, as excess supplies are depleted and the channel stabilizes, FMC is well-positioned to capitalize on the anticipated market recovery starting in Q2.\n\nDespite the 32% YOY revenue decline, FMC delivered EBITDA at the high end of guidance and EPS above the midpoint. Restructuring actions are on track to deliver $50-75 million in net savings this year. Moreover, free cash flow showed remarkable improvement compared to Q1 2023. I believe we\u2019ll see a solid price recovery with revenue and EPS rebounding. FMC corp rebound\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nBranded diamides posted double-digit growth in Latin America, while the Xyway and Adastrio fungicides excelled in North America. As headwinds dissipate and these offerings gain traction, FMC\u2019s fundamentals should strengthen considerably. The recent selloff seems like a solid entry point. It also has a 3.94% dividend yield.\n\nDollar General (DG) The front of a Dollar General (DG Stock) store on a sunny day.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDollar General (NYSE:DG) operates a chain of discount retail stores across the United States. The stock has been unfairly punished in the recent market selloff and is trading at a bargain price.\n\nIn Q1, DG delivered an impressive 6.1% sales growth to $9.9 billion while expanding its footprint with 197 new stores. Same-store sales also beat expectations, rising 2.4% on strong 4%+ customer traffic growth. The company can attract shoppers in basically any economic climate. Plus, TTM EPS is expected to start recovering soon. DG EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nManagement noted that budget-conscious consumers are increasingly relying on DG for essential consumables, driving market share gains. DG is well-positioned to keep winning over customers who are trading down from higher-priced retailers.\n\nWhile near-term headwinds have weighed on the stock, I believe this is a classic case of the market overreacting. DG\u2019s long-term growth story remains firmly intact. Patient investors who buy this dip should be handsomely rewarded as this best-in-class retailer gets back on the path to delivering market-beating returns. The stock also has a 1.69% dividend yield to sweeten the deal.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- There\u2019s no let up in the rush by Chinese technology companies to issue convertible bonds, with online travel agency Trip.com now following industry giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. into the action.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority Short Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains Bonds Rally as Traders Reload Fed Bets After Data: Markets Wrap Modi\u2019s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who\u2019s Next for India? BlackRock, Citadel Back Upstart Texas Challenge to NYSE, Nasdaq\n\nTrip.com announced Tuesday a proposed offering of $1.3 billion convertible senior notes due in 2029 to help repay debt, expand overseas and for working capital needs. To ease any dilution effect, it plans to use cash to buy back up to $400 million worth of American Depository Receipts when issuing the notes.\n\nThe activity follows hot on the heels of several announcements late last month, the biggest being Alibaba\u2019s record-breaking $5 billion issue. JD.com Inc. set the ball rolling in May with a $2 billion convertible bond offering, and computer-maker Lenovo Group Ltd. also sold $2 billion zero-coupon convertible bonds to a unit of Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nThe companies are looking to get funds cheaply via low coupons as interest rates stay elevated. Meanwhile, the rush is a boost for bankers in Hong Kong, where general dealmaking in areas such as initial public offerings has slowed.\n\nTrip.com is offering a coupon of 0.5% to 1% on its notes and a 30%-50% conversion premium, according to terms seen by Bloomberg. It expects the offer to attract convertible arbitrage, a strategy where funds purchase notes and short the underlying stock, which could affect share price. Trip.com slid as much as 4.1% in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning, the most since April 29.\n\n\u201cExpect some near-term share price volatility amid convertible bonds hedging activity and possible profit-taking by short-term investors,\u201d Citigroup Inc. analysts including Brian Gong wrote in a note. Trip.com\u2019s issue makes sense despite its strong cash position, given it is expanding to gain share in Asia, has short-term borrowings of $5.35 billion and needs investment, they said.\n\nSeparately, Mergermarket reported Tuesday that Meituan is working with Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a second convertible offer, without disclosing details such as size and timing.\n\nMeituan\u2019s shares rose as much as 2.2%, building on gains of 3.7% and 4.1% Monday and Tuesday. The company\u2019s first-quarter earnings are due Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs of today, Meituan has no plans to issue convertible bonds,\u201d a representative for the online shopping platform told Bloomberg.\n\n--With assistance from Jane Zhang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStartup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies The Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle Elon and Donald Seem to Have Made Up Yes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chinese stocks don\u2019t always have the best reputation among American traders. While these businesses can often hold sound theses and financials, the wildcard of potential government intervention or macroeconomic concerns can easily throw off your entire investment rationale. Risks mount up compared to other foreign companies With so much uncertainty, undervalued Chinese stocks are considered riskier trades.\n\nOver the past few years, Chinese stocks have been decimated. A regulatory crackdown by the CCP in November 2020 sent shockwaves through the industry. Stocks like Alibaba have fallen by 50% over the past five years, shedding hundreds of billions of dollars from their market cap. But at a certain point, these beaten-down companies become tremendous discounted opportunities. Here are three undervalued Chinese stocks to buy now for a bounce back.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is the eighth-largest Chinese company in market capitalization and is a pioneer in the eCommerce and digital payments sectors. Wall Street analysts are certainly forecasting a rebound for Alibaba. In May, 47 of 48 recommendations were a Buy or Strong Buy rating, and the average price target of $109.49 represented a nearly 40% upside from the current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs mentioned, the stock has been down by roughly 50% over the past five years. Surprisingly, at that time, the company\u2019s Alipay super app became the most widely used payment application in China, with over 660 million monthly active users. Alibaba\u2019s operations of two of China\u2019s largest eCommerce sites, Tmall and Taobao, have also been crucial for this company in expanding its addressable market and solidifying Alibaba\u2019s market dominance.\n\nAlibaba is an undervalued Chinese stock because it\u2019s trading at historically low multiples. Shares of BABA trade at 1.5x sales and 9.3x forward earnings despite growing its revenue at a ten-year CAGR of 33%. With such a discounted price underlying great financials, Alibaba stock is an amazing candidate for a rebound and breakout in June.\n\nJD.Com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese e-commerce company focusing on the business-to-consumer or B2C industry. It is a direct competitor to Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform and, like Alibaba, holds a bullish outlook for Wall Street analysts. The average analyst price target is $43.33, which implies more than 40% upside, and the street-high target of $97.12 is more than three times its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, JD had a surprisingly good earnings report, and the stock rebounded. Revenue grew by 7.04% QOQ, and net income jumped by nearly 14.0%. Another area where JD is excelling? It\u2019s now building up the largest network of drone and robotic delivery services. Their investments in AI and robotics and testing of autonomous delivery trucks have also been guided by management to be key growth driving areas.\n\nLike Alibaba, you\u2019re getting JD at a rock bottom price multiple. Shares trade at 0.3x sales and 8.9x forward earnings. This low multiple is also accompanied by a company that has grown its revenue at a CAGR of 30% over the past ten years and its five-year net income at a CAGR of 50%! Buying JD stock at these prices almost seems like a no-brainer.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Smartphone displaying orange Temu logo in a miniature shopping cart against a yellow background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/yanishevska\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is more known as the owner of eCommerce website PinDuoDuo. In May, 44 of the 45 analyst recommendations for PDD were a Buy or Strong Buy rating. The average analyst price target sits at $205.53, which is nearly 40% higher than today\u2019s price.\n\nThis stock has fared better than Alibaba and JD over the past year. Shares of PDD have returned more than 120% over the past 52 weeks and more than 650% over the past five years. This growth is largely attributed to the launch of its Temu marketplace in more than 50 countries worldwide to take on Tmall and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Although it started as an agricultural marketplace, PDD\u2019s platforms now sell nearly anything you can think of!\n\nDespite increasing its revenue at a ten-year CAGR of 67%, shares are trading at lower multiples than ever before. Shares of PDD trade at 5.2x sales and 12.9x forward earnings. But the impressive thing about PDD is its 62% gross margins, nearly double the industry average of 32.5%! With such healthy financials, it would be foolish not to scoop up shares in this undervalued Chinese company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's sales campaign for this year's 618 shopping festival is seeing strong momentum, according to preliminary data from the firm's Taobao and Tmall platforms, helping boost the Chinese e-commerce giant's prospects of returning to double-digit revenue growth by 2027.\n\nAbout 185 brands - including major smartphone vendors Apple, Xiaomi and Huawei Technologies - have each achieved more than 100 million yuan (US$13.8 million) in gross merchandise value, while 37,000 other brands doubled sales year on year as of 9pm on May 31, the latest data released by Alibaba e-commerce unit Taobao and Tmall Group showed. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nIn the highly competitive cosmetics sector, brands on Tmall have so far stood out during the 618 shopping festival. Local brand Shanghai Hanshu Cosmetics, for example, reported a 126 per cent year-on-year increase in sales from May 20 to 28, part of the initial period of promotions for the midyear shopping festival. Alibaba's 618 campaign will conclude on June 20.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe preliminary data augurs well for Alibaba, whose co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai recently said the Hangzhou-based company will see double-digit revenue growth during its financial year ending March 2027.\n\nThe midyear 618 shopping festival, which was initiated by JD.com in 2010, has become mainland China's second-biggest retail extravaganza behind Singles' Day in the fourth quarter.

Illustration: Shutterstock>\n\n\"From a planning standpoint, on a three-year time horizon, we'd like to be growing double digits by our fiscal year 2027,\" Tsai said on May 23 during a fireside chat with Kam Shing Kwang, JPMorgan's chairwoman for North Asia and vice-chair of investment banking in Greater China.\n\nTsai indicated that Alibaba does not see either geopolitical or regulatory factors as potential stumbling blocks. \"We're in a stable regulatory environment [where] regulation is quite predictable,\" he said.\n\nDuring a conference call in May, Tsai pointed out that Alibaba's e-commerce platforms saw sales of discretionary items, like apparel and electronics, grow during the Labour Day holiday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat showed how mainland consumers' attitudes \"are starting to reflect a willingness to spend\", he said.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai speaks onstage at the TAAF Heritage Month Summit on May 3, 2024 in New York City.

Photo: Getty Images for The Asian American Foundation>\n\nTsai's optimism has been bolstered by Alibaba's most profitable financial year since 2021.\n\nThe company grew its net income 10 per cent to 79.7 billion yuan (US$11 billion) in the 12 months ended March, beating the 72.5 billion yuan profit recorded the previous financial year.\n\nRevenue for the year rose 8 per cent to 941.2 billion yuan, beating the consensus estimate of 939.7 billion yuan, in the first results released for a financial year since Tsai took over as chairman last September.\n\nTsai said Alibaba has high hopes for its self-developed Tongyi Qianwen large language models (LLMs), the technology behind generative artificial intelligence (AI) services like ChatGPT. More than 90,000 corporate clients have adopted these LLMs.\n\nAlibaba's unique advantage is that the company combines its in-house AI and cloud computing businesses, giving it an edge over US rivals such as Microsoft and Amazon.com, which have leading cloud services but do not have in-house LLMs.\n\n\"As a lay person [looking] to understand AI, it's like educating a child: you send them to middle school, high school, college and then eventually they get PhDs,\" Tsai said.\n\n\"It takes about 22 years to send a kid to college and graduate from college. It took [Alibaba], maybe, three or four years to get to the large language models to be as smart as human beings in terms of knowledge.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Alibaba could join the Stock Connect cross-border trading mechanism as early as September 9, after its dual-primary shares listing in Hong Kong is completed, according to Morgan Stanley. The overall impact on the market is expected to be limited, however, after an initial influx of money from mainland investors, they said.\n\nUp to US$12 billion of investment from mainlanders is likely in the first six months after the e-commerce giant joins the Stock Connect scheme, which would bring their ownership of Alibaba to around 7 per cent, strategists including Laura Wang said in a note on Sunday.\n\nThe percentage of mainland ownership is likely to stabilise around the low teens in the long run, they added.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"We expect some inflows but not major,\" they wrote.\n\nAlibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company, whose American depositary receipts (ADRs) are traded in New York, disclosed a progress report on its primary listing plan in Hong Kong last month. It said it expects to complete the conversion from secondary to primary listing by the end of August, which is a prerequisite to be included in the Stock Connect, the cross-border exchange link programme.\n\nIf approved, the completion of the listing process at the end of August implies that the first day of so-called southbound trading could be as early as September 9, the US bank said. The southbound channel of the Stock Connect programme refers to the buying and selling of shares in Hong Kong by mainland investors.\n\n\"The main reason for us to proceed with the dual primary listing is because we want to tap into the southbound capital flows through the Stock Connect programme,\" Joe Tsai, co-founder and chairman of Alibaba, said in an interview with the Post.\n\nSouthbound trading has become a major pillar of the city's market since the launch of the Stock Connect scheme in 2014, as mainland investors deploy money to Hong Kong in search of diversifying their investments.\n\nOnshore investors have ploughed US$36.3 billion into the city's stock market so far this year, taking the net buying of local shares to over US$400 billion (HK$3 trillion) as foreign investors retreat, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe inclusion in Stock Connect could potentially provide some liquidity and valuation support to Alibaba, whose Hong Kong-listed shares have been lagging the broader market so far in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Hang Seng Index has climbed 8 per cent this year driven by a recovery in risk appetite, while Alibaba only added 1.4 per cent as investors remained wary of the pressures brought by rivals like Pinduoduo.\n\nStill, more recent market dynamics suggest there are reasons to be cautious about southbound inclusion, Morgan Stanley said. Mainland investors' appetite for large-cap internet stocks might have already waned, as suggested by the weak fund flows into peers like Tencent this year, the analysts said.\n\nThere has been a major shift in the direction of southbound flows from internet companies to financials and telecoms, as mainland investors prioritise stable cash returns from industries with high dividend yield, they said.\n\n\"Southbound's incremental support for liquidity and turnover could be limited,\" Wang wrote in the note.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "3 High-Octane Stocks That Billionaires Are Buying",
        "content": "Following the stock selections of famous investors can be a great way to find future winners. These investors generally have excellent track records of beating the market's average returns, and because some of these professionals oversee billions of dollars in assets for their clients, they conduct exhaustive research before investing in a company.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors were asked to identify three high-octane stocks that they favor and that billionaire investors have been buying recently. Their picks: Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), Coupang(NYSE: CPNG), and Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG).\n\nA fallen growth stock that could spring back to life\n\nJohn Ballard (Alibaba): Alibaba shares are trading well off their peak today. Economic headwinds from COVID-related issues weighed on consumer spending in China last year, which significantly impacted Alibaba's revenues, and the stock's moves reflected that. But this once fast-growing e-commerce and cloud computing leader could be turning a corner.\n\nOne billionaire investor who has acquired a sizable stake in the company is Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, who has an estimated net worth of $20 billion, according to Forbes. Tepper is a highly successful hedge fund manager, and his firm more than doubled its stake in Alibaba to $814 million during the first quarter.\n\nWhile Alibaba doesn't look like a high-octane stock right now, the opportunity it has to expand internationally through its AliExpress cross-border retail business, in addition to meeting the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) services through Alibaba Cloud, could see the company's revenue growth improve in the coming years.\n\nAlibaba's revenue jumped 7% year over year in the March-ending quarter, driven by its market-leading Taobao and Tmall online retail businesses. It also reported strong demand for AI services in Alibaba Cloud. These results show the worst is likely behind the company now. Management noted in the last earnings report that the improved shopping experiences in Taobao and Tmall should help the retail group return to healthy growth in its fiscal 2025 (which will end in March 2025).\n\nWith the shares trading at a cheap forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.4, the stock could double in value if it moves closer to the market's average P/E of 21.\n\nThis e-commerce company is making all the right moves\n\nJeremy Bowman(Coupang): E-commerce presents one of the biggest growth opportunities in global business, and one of the more intriguing ways to get exposure to it is through Coupang, South Korea's leading e-commerce operator.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoupang is growing rapidly, expanding its profit margins, and borrowing liberally from the playbook that made Amazon into the titan it is today. It's expanding into new businesses like food delivery and video streaming, and it recently acquired Farfetch, the luxury online fashion marketplace. It's also investing in AI technology to help run its warehouses with robots.\n\nIn Coupang's most recent quarter, revenue jumped 28% on a currency-neutral basis to $7.1 billion, and its gross profit soared 36% to $1.9 billion, thanks in part to its recent price hike on its Prime-like Rocket Wow membership service.\n\nNot surprisingly, the stock has caught the attention of some billionaire investors. Stanley Druckenmiller, the mastermind behind Duquesne Capital Management, the hedge fund that delivered average annual returns of roughly 30% for nearly 30 years, counts Coupang as the second-largest holding in his family office, behind Microsoft.\n\nDruckenmiler hasn't explained why he likes Coupang, but the stock's combination of growth potential at a reasonable valuation is intriguing. The shares sport a P/E of 33.\n\nSome other billionaires who bought Coupang in the first quarter include Marc Stad, whose Dragoneer Investment Group fund purchased nearly 2 million shares, and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, who bought nearly 1 million shares.\n\nGiven the past success of e-commerce companies like Amazon and MercadoLibre, and Coupang's own growth potential, improving profitability, and reasonable valuation, it wouldn't be surprising to see more billionaire investors buy Coupang stock in the coming quarters.\n\nA perennial winner that could still make millionaires\n\nJennifer Saibil (Chipotle Mexican Grill): Chipotle has probably minted a few millionaires over its years on the stock market, and it has been a mainstay in billionaire Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital equity portfolio.\n\nIn the first quarter, Ackman actually sold some shares, but it might have been to rebalance the portfolio. Pershing Square only owns eight stocks, and even after the sale, Chipotle stock is up from 18% of the total to 20%.\n\nWhile Ackman sold, other billionaire investors were buying in. Ken Griffin of Citadel Investors, for example, bought 135,356 shares in the first quarter. Chipotle stock is up 35% this year, and it's been a reliable gainer for most of its time as a public company.\n\nInvestors love Chipotle, and for good reason. It regularly reports double-digit percentage increases in revenue, driven by strong comparable sales growth. Earnings per share (EPS) consistently grow. That trend was on display in Q1, with a 14% year-over-year increase in sales and a 7% boost in comparable sales. EPS rose from $10.50 to $13.01.\n\nPlus, there's another reason Chipotle stock has been off to the races this year. In March, management announced a 50-for-1 stock split that will take place in June. Stock splits usually indicate that a company's management team is confident about its future, and even though they don't do anything to alter the value of the underlying business, investors love them. Chipotle shares have been trading above $1,000 for a while, so this split was probably overdue.\n\nThis fast-casual chain is an all-weather winner with plenty more growth ahead. Retail investors should join the billionaires in adding Chipotle shares to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $677,040!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Pinduoduo, the mainland budget-shopping platform of PDD Holdings, has introduced an \"automated price-tracking system\" for merchants to swiftly adjust prices online, as China's e-commerce giants gear up for this year's 618 shopping festival.\n\nThe novel system, which Pinduoduo rolled out on Wednesday, provides merchants on the platform a fast and intelligent way to \"keep pace with [the pricing strategy of] competitors\", according to a report by Chinese digital media DoNews on Thursday.\n\nThe system, for example, will automatically adjust the online prices of its user as soon as it finds a rival merchant offering lower prices, the report said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAccording to screenshots of the system posted by Pinduoduo merchants on Chinese social media, subscribers can set up a specific range that the system would follow when adjusting the price of goods. The system will be in operation until June 21, which is the end of Pinduoduo's 618 sales campaign.\n\nPinduoduo's automated price-tracking system is expected to give merchants on the platform a competitive edge during this year's 618 shopping festival. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Pinduoduo's automated price-tracking system is expected to give merchants on the platform a competitive edge during this year's 618 shopping festival. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nPinduoduo's latest initiative reflects the escalating price war among China's e-commerce services providers amid a slowdown in retail sales.\n\nByteDance-owned Douyin recently started internal tests for a similar smart pricing system for merchants, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nThose moves show how online shopping platform operators are looking to boost sales during the 618 shopping festival, following a relatively muted run in 2023. All the major domestic e-commerce players are expected to offer steep discounts and cash subsidies.\n\nThe festival, which was initiated by JD.com in 2010, began as a simple promotion for the firm's June 18 anniversary. The event has since grown into the country's second-biggest shopping extravaganza behind Singles' Day in the fourth quarter.\n\nPinduoduo kicked off its 618 sales campaign on May 19, but has yet to release any sales figures.\n\nAn advertisement for the 618 shopping festival promotion on Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall platform at a subway station in Shanghai.

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba Group Holding, which started its promotions on May 20, touted last week that 59 brands on its platforms each saw their gross merchandise value (GMV) - the total amount of goods sold - surpass 100 million yuan (US$13.8 million), while 376 products saw GMV exceed 10 million yuan. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nJD.com, meanwhile, kicked off its 618 promotions on Friday evening.\n\nAlibaba's Taobao and Tmall Group have upgraded the price guarantee feature on their apps for this year's event, allowing consumers to receive a refund on price differences until July 5, in case any further discounts are found online after they made their purchase.\n\nIn 2021, Pinduoduo was the first major e-commerce platform to introduce a refund policy that allowed users to get their money back without returning goods that do not match a merchant's description. That policy is credited with helping Pinduoduo draw more price-sensitive Chinese consumers away from its competitors.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "New AI battle adopts old price war strategy as Chinese tech giants keep start-ups at bay behind the Great Firewall",
        "content": "In the 18 months since Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Chinese tech firms large and small have rallied around a singular goal - besting the San Francisco-based start-up with their own Chinese-language chatbots.\n\nThe results have been mixed, with some tech giants claiming to have better results than GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced model, with Chinese queries. But with a deluge of more than 200 Chinese large language models (LLMs) - the tech powering these chatbots - from a slew of companies all jostling for market share, China's AI firms can claim at least one other clear, albeit less boastworthy, advantage over their US counterparts: price.\n\nIn recent weeks, TikTok owner ByteDance, internet search giant Baidu, e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding and social media behemoth Tencent Holdings have all drastically slashed prices on their LLM services, with some offering a variety of services for free. One premium offering from ByteDance's Doubao Pro costs as low as 0.0008 yuan (0.011 US cents) per 1,000-token prompt, 99.8 per cent less than what OpenAI charges for GPT-4 access.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"It's like the bad money is driving out good money,\" said You Yang, a computer science professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n\nThe price war indicates a lack of competitiveness based on the merits of the models themselves, according to You, making them incapable of attracting customers at previous market prices.\n\nIn the US, tech giants like Google owner Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Microsoft have also been competing in AI by following the \"blitzscaling\" playbook that has become commonplace in Silicon Valley: acquiring users as quickly as possible, at the expense of revenue, to corner a market.\n\nYet even while enjoying the \"walled garden\" behind the Great Firewall that censors foreign internet services, Chinese firms face limits from Washington's export restrictions on advanced chips from Nvidia, whose graphics processing units have become central to AI model development. They also have less corporate spending power than their peers in the liquidity-rich US market.\n\n\"The price reduction [for Chinese AI services] mainly aims to attract more clients and is more like a branding practice,\" Xu Li, CEO and co-founder of Hong Kong-listed AI company SenseTime, told the South China Morning Post in an interview this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nByteDance launched the opening salvo of the price war in mid-May when it unveiled the pricing of its Doubao AI enterprise services that aggressively undercut its domestic rivals.\n\nUnder this pricing, 1 yuan could buy 1.25 million input tokens. By comparison, it would cost around US$37.50, or 272 yuan, to buy 1.25 million GPT-4 tokens.\n\nIn AI, a token is a fundamental unit of data that is processed by algorithms. For Chinese LLMs, a token typically equates to between 1 and 1.8 Chinese characters.\n\nOther Chinese tech heavyweights were quick to respond.\n\nAlibaba, owner of the Post, was the first to react, dropping the price of its Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) service by as much as 97 per cent, from 0.02 yuan per 1,000-token prompt to 0.0005 yuan, or 0.0003 yuan cheaper than ByteDance.\n\nSeveral companies including Baidu, Tencent and iFlytek, an AI specialist known for its audio recognition technology, followed with even more drastic price cuts, some offering access to their less powerful LLMs for free.\n\nWang Sheng, an investor with Beijing-based InnoAngel Fund, said this kind of \"vicious\" price competition is hurting local AI start-ups.\n\n\"When it comes to developing LLMs, Big Tech companies are not necessarily better than start-ups,\" Wang said. \"But their practice of subsidisation to grab a bigger market share is detrimental to these firms.\"\n\nAlain Le Couedic, senior partner at AI investment house Artificial Intelligence Quartermaster (AIQ), suggested that the price competition will pay off for some over time.\n\n\"The race for dominance in the market is a sign that many players see attractive opportunities down the road, even if this requires some pain in the short- to mid-term,\" he said.\n\nLLMs are energy intensive, making them expensive to run, so the marginal cost of adding a new user is likely higher than for other online services. This makes blitzscaling more complicated for AI services. A race to make LLMs more efficient could eventually change this math, though.\n\n\"People are pursuing these improvements in efficiency ... because it pays to do so,\" Bill MacCartney, chief technology officer at the venture capital firm SignalFire and a computer science professor at Stanford University, told the Post at the UBS Asian Investment Conference this week. \"It costs a growing amount of money to operate these models, and people have a powerful economic incentive to find ways to make it cheaper.\"\n\nMacCartney noted that resources are pouring into finding efficiency gains across multiple levels: \"There's improvements at the silicon level, there's improvements in model architecture, there's improvements in that kind of software that we layer above the models.\"\n\n\"It's not far-fetched to imagine that we'll see over a three-year horizon ... maybe a 10x improvement in inference efficiency broadly across AI,\" he said.\n\nBill MacCartney (right), chief technology officer at the venture capital firm SignalFire and computer science professor at Stanford University, discusses generative artificial intelligence at the UBS Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong on May 29, 2024.

Photo: Handout>\n\nSome companies have said improved efficiencies in training and running models are the main reason for their price reductions. OpenAI credited new efficiencies for the reason behind the much lower pricing on its GPT-4o model launched in May.\n\nRobin Li Yanhong, founder and CEO of Baidu, said in April that the efficiency of training its flagship Ernie LLM improved 5.1 times within a year. The model's inferencing performance increased 105 times, reducing inferencing costs by 99 per cent.\n\nByteDance also said it cut prices because it is confident in being able to reduce its costs through technical improvements.\n\nWherever profits stand, tech companies have been quick to attribute rising revenues to the AI boom.\n\nAlibaba Cloud said its 3 per cent growth in the March quarter was buttressed in part by AI-related income that accelerated growth. Baidu Cloud reported 12 per cent revenue growth in the same quarter, with generative AI and foundation model services accounting for 6.9 per cent of total AI cloud revenue.\n\nUS tech giants Google and Microsoft have likewise reported robust demand for their cloud-based LLM services. In its third-quarter results, revenue at Microsoft's intelligent cloud unit grew 21 per cent from a year earlier. Google, meanwhile, saw first-quarter revenue expand 28 per cent year on year.\n\n\"We have witnessed Microsoft's market capitalisation soar, and everyone is eager to capitalise on this opportunity,\" said Ivan Lam, an analyst at market consultancy Counterpoint Research. \"The Chinese market is particularly keen to establish quick links between [AI] applications and business [uses] in order to foster further advancements in its LLMs.\"\n\nAlibaba declined to provide data on the growth in usage of its LLMs after its recent price cut, but the company said that the number of calls to its Qwen application programming interface (API) from a top Chinese recruiting firm spiked 100-fold within a week.\n\nAt least for users of these LLMs like that recruiting firm, the current economics of AI services appear to be paying off.\n\nZhao Chong, founder and CEO of AI-powered graphic design service iSheji, was upbeat about cheaper LLMs in an interview with the Chinese news portal Sohu.com published on May 24.\n\n\"For start-ups like us building applications, [the price war] is a good thing,\" Zhao told Sohu. \"LLM costs used to account for between 5 and 10 per cent of our total costs, now it could be 1 per cent, boosting our profit margins.\"\n\nThese consumer-facing service providers have in turn been reducing the prices of their own offerings, with many available for free.\n\nMeanwhile, start-ups that are in a position to do so are trying to sit out the price war. Beijing-based Baichuan and 01.AI - a company established by Lee Kai-fu, a Taiwanese computer scientist who previously headed Google China - have dismissed the idea of cutting prices.\n\nYou, the NUS computer scientist, noted the benefits of low prices for app developers, but he cautioned that these applications might not perform well if built on subpar foundation models.\n\nDespite this, the price war has emerged because companies have limited options. Competing on price is always easier than endless improvement to model capabilities, according to Yan Lijie, founder and CEO of Shanghai-based MiniMax, one of China's four \"AI Tigers\".\n\n\"[Reaching] the upper limit of a technology is less certain and requires more exploration,\" Yan said in a fireside chat published by Chinese technology news site Geekpark on May 23. \"Whereas there is always a way to cut price.\"\n\nCounterpoint's Lam said that price competition may be inevitable for companies looking to maintain dominance in AI services as the market becomes increasingly crowded.\n\nSome of China's tech giants would appear to have an edge when it comes to compute resources and money to burn. AIQ's Le Couedic said it is too early to predict a potential winner of an AI price war, as the industry is still not mature. Business models and technical edge will both be key factors in determining the dominant players, he added.\n\n\"At the end of the day ... companies with the best services and best technologies will win,\" Le Couedic said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Haldane.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Alibaba\u2019s BABA international e-commerce retail arm, AliExpress, announced several promotional campaigns for shoppers after being named the exclusive global e-commerce partner of UEFA EURO 2024.\r\n\r\nThe company announced that 1,000 shoppers would have a chance to win UEFA EURO 2024 match tickets.\r\n\r\nThe promotional campaigns also include a Choice Day and Summer Sale with a theme of 'Summer Carnival,' a 'Shake & Win' game for time-limited prizes, and a fun quiz where users can win discounts, match tickets and discount coupons worth up to $500 each.\r\n\r\nAlibaba aims to enhance the user experience for its global consumers on the back of this announcement. This, in turn, is expected to drive solid customer momentum among international shoppers and sports enthusiasts for its AliExpress platform, thereby expanding its global reach.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nStrength in International Ecommerce Business Aids Growth\n\nThese promotional campaigns bode well for the company\u2019s continuous efforts to bolster its international e-commerce business.\r\n\r\nIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, Trendyol expanded its cross-border business in the Gulf region. Alibaba\u2019s increased investments to boost customer experience by expanding merchandise categories, as well as providing speedy and reliable delivery played the key catalyst of its Gulf expansion. As a result, Trendyol became one of the most downloaded e-commerce apps in the Gulf region during the quarter.\r\n\r\nAlibaba\u2019s growing initiatives to provide price competitiveness and high delivery speed to customers of AliExpress Choice further strengthened its international commerce business. The company created synergies between AliExpress and the cross-border logistics operations of Cainiao to bolster AliExpress\u2019 5-day and 10-day delivery services. It also increased investments in key markets to enhance customer experience, expand consumer base and strengthen its market position globally.\r\n\r\nThese efforts will continue aiding Alibaba in expanding its international e-commerce footprint. This, in turn, will strengthen its Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) segment\u2019s performance, which is currently the key growth driver of the company.\r\n\r\nThe AIDC segment, which comprises Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Alibaba.com, and other businesses operating in the international retail and wholesale markets, generated RMB 27.45 billion ($3.8 billion) in revenues, exhibiting year-over-year growth of 45%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening AIDC segment is expected to aid Alibaba\u2019s overall top-line performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 total revenues stands at $138.63 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntensifying Competition Hurts Alibaba\n\nHowever, Alibaba faces stiff competition against industry players like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY in the global e-commerce market.\r\n\r\nCompetitive pressure, coupled with rising expenses related to new initiatives, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations, remains a major risk for the company. Its shares have returned 2.7% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s gain of 8.6%. Its shares have also\u00a0 underperformed Amazon and eBay\u2019s growth of 18% and 23%, respectively, in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nAmazon has been leading the e-commerce market on the back of its strong Prime momentum, robust distribution strength, expanding fulfillment network and growing relationships with third-party sellers.\r\n\r\neBay, on the other hand, is making concerted efforts to strengthen its position in the e-commerce space. It recently launched a mobile consignment concierge, the Luxe Line, to offer a convenient selling experience, allowing visitors in Los Angeles and Las Vegas to directly access expert sellers listing and selling luxury items.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, BABA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the retail-wholesale sector is Coupang CPNG, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "content": "Alibaba and Coupang Intensify E-Commerce Battle with Major Investments in South Korea\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), through its online platform AliExpress, has significantly increased its presence in South Korea, doubling its users to 8.58 million by April, according to Wiseapp.\n\nAlibaba earmarked $1.1 billion for South Korea to build a new logistics center. This expansion comes amid fierce competition from domestic e-retailer Coupang, Inc (NYSE:CPNG), which is aggressively investing in advanced technologies and logistics to maintain its market share, taking a cue from Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nCoupang reported a net loss of $24 million in the first quarter, its first in seven quarters. This loss was driven by substantial investments in AI-powered robots and a vast network of delivery drivers, the Nikkei Asia reports.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s net income plunged 86% to $453 million in the comparative quarter due to net loss from its investments in publicly traded companies during the quarter. Adjusted net income declined 11% Y/Y to $3.38 billion.\n\nCoupang\u2019s CEO, Kim Bom-suk, highlighted concerns over growing competition from Chinese e-commerce platforms offering low-priced products, such as AliExpress and PDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu.\n\nAliExpress\u2019s strategy includes a $1.1 billion investment in a logistics hub and call center in South Korea, aiming to match Coupang\u2019s quick delivery times.\n\nDomestically, Coupang faces stiff competition from Naver, which holds a 20% market share compared to Coupang\u2019s 22%.\n\nTo diversify, Coupang is exploring new opportunities in grocery and food delivery, areas where Chinese rivals struggle.\n\nPrice Actions: CPNG shares were trading higher by 0.34% at $23.31 premarket at the last check on Friday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto Via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALIBABA GR HLDGS (BABA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Alibaba and Coupang Intensify E-Commerce Battle with Major Investments in South Korea originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned -0.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.24 per share, indicating a change of -6.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 points to a change of -4.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.20 indicates a change of +12.2% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for BABA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $34.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $138.63 billion and $148.86 billion estimates indicate +6.2% and +7.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $30.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +12.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "A number of high-ranking executives at Taobao and Tmall Group have retired, paving the way for a younger generation of leaders to take the reins of Alibaba Group Holding's core e-commerce unit, as competition heats up with rivals such as PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo and ByteDance-owned Douyin.\n\nSenior executives that include Wang Hai, Liu Peng, Yu Feng and Wang Mingqiang retired from Taobao and Tmall Group on May 1, according to Chinese media reports on Wednesday.\n\nTheir exit comes several months after Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, promoted six young executives to lead key departments of Taobao and Tmall Group, part of a management reshuffle under Alibaba chief executive Eddie Wu Yongming - who took over last December as chief executive of the e-commerce unit, where he has served as chairman since May 2023.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding is selling its entire stake in e-commerce branding solutions provider Baozun, as the Chinese technology giant continues its corporate restructuring amid increased industry competition.\n\nHangzhou-based Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, on Thursday signed a deal to sell 26.5 million Baozun shares to Champion Kerry for US$21.8 million, according to Baozun's latest regulatory filing. Those shares represent about 14.4 per cent of the total outstanding shares of Baozun as of March 31 this year.\n\nThat transaction followed Alibaba's disposal of nearly US$360 million worth of Bilibili shares in March at a significant discount, according to stock exchange filings. In the same month, the e-commerce giant also raised about US$314 million from its sale of 33 million US-traded shares of electric vehicle maker Xpeng.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe latest deal shows Alibaba's continued adjustment of the corporate overhaul it announced in March last year, underscoring the impact of China's shaky post-pandemic economic recovery that has weakened consumer spending and resulted in slower growth for the domestic internet sector.\n\nThe headquarters of e-commerce branding solutions provider Baozun in Shanghai.

Photo: Baozun>\n\nDuring a conference call in February, senior Alibaba executives said the company is sharpening its focus on its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses, while putting noncore operations up for sale.\n\nBaozun said it will maintain a \"mutually beneficial business relationship\" that includes a strategic cooperation with Alibaba. Following the transfer of shares to Champion Kerry, Alibaba will cease to be a shareholder of Baozun.\n\nFounded in 2007 in Shanghai, Baozun provides integrated e-commerce branding solutions - covering information technology systems, store operations, digital marketing and customer services - on the mainland. It serves more than 450 brands around the world, according to its website.\n\nBaozun, which is listed on the Nasdaq and Hong Kong stock exchanges, this week reported first-quarter revenue of 2 billion yuan (US$274.2 million), up 4.9 per cent from 1.9 billion yuan in the same period last year. It also posted a narrower net loss of 66.6 million yuan, from 83.5 million yuan a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's Hong Kong-listed shares have fallen 91.5 per cent since it completed its secondary listing in 2020.\n\nBaozun is listed on both the Nasdaq and Hong Kong stock exchanges. Photo: Baozun alt=Baozun is listed on both the Nasdaq and Hong Kong stock exchanges. Photo: Baozun>\n\nAlibaba was an early investor in Baozun, injecting 32.7 million yuan during the A-round financing in 2010.\n\nAs competition heats up with younger rivals like PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo and ByteDance-owned Douyin, a Reuters report in February, citing unnamed sources, said Alibaba was also considering the sale of its bricks-and-mortar retail chains Freshippo and RT-Mart. This was subsequently denied by Alibaba.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Coca-Cola Co. KO, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, KLA Corp. KLAC, Mobile Infrastructure Corp. BEEP and Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp. ESP.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Coca-Cola, Alibaba and KLA\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Coca-Cola Co., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and KLA Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks Mobile Infrastructure Corp. and Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp.

The company continues to witness positive business trends as reflected by its robust surprise history. KO's sales and earnings beat estimates for the fifth consecutive quarter in first-quarter 2024.\r\n\r\nEarnings and sales also improved year over year. Strong revenue growth across most of its operating segments aided by improved price/mix and unit volume growth boosted the results. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2024.\r\n\r\nHowever, KO witnesses inflationary cost pressures, related to higher commodity and material costs, as well as higher marketing investments.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alibaba have gained +2.1% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry's gain of +14.7%. The company is benefiting from strong momentum across its international business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC's retail businesses and strength in AliExpress' Choice are contributing well.\r\n\r\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth. Strength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba's international business.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\r\n\r\nKLA's shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the year-to-date period (+34.1% vs. +17.9%). The company is benefiting from strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development.\r\n\r\nGrowing adoption of KLA's 8900 series platform for high throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in its optical inspection portfolio in 2023.\r\n\r\nGrowing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry & Logic are driving the top-line growth. KLA's emphasis on integration of AI into its solutions has driven its outperformance in the semiconductor market.\r\n\r\nHowever, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind. Softness in memory and leading-edge, logic and foundry investments has been a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on KLA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Mobile Infrastructure have underperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Operations industry over the year-to-date period (-15.6% vs. -1.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $105.06 million is facing high debt levels, thus interest rate sensitivity poses a major risk. Limited revenue diversification, intense competition, seasonal variability, regulatory risks and work-from-home trends persist.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mobile Infrastructure owns a diverse portfolio of 42 parking assets in 21 major U.S. markets, ensuring steady demand and stable revenue streams. The portfolio, valued at $520 million in 2022, saw an 11.9% increase in net operating income (NOI).\r\n\r\nThe first quarter of 2024 revenue uptick was driven by organic growth and converting 26 assets to management contracts, improving operating efficiency. Increased utilization across key markets, advanced technology and proprietary analytics enhance pricing and demand. Financially stable with $13.9 million in cash and $192.1 million in debt, the company has a $300 million acquisition pipeline.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Mobile Infrastructure here >>>)\r\n\r\nEspey's shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Military industry over the year-to-date period (+14.6% vs. +7.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $57.69 million is well positioned in the defense electronics market, Espey benefits from increasing demand for advanced systems. Its vertical integration allows high-quality production and flexibility.\r\n\r\nInnovation is driven by a $7.4 million U.S. Navy award for facility upgrades. However, competitive pressures, dependence on government contracts, declining net sales and stringent regulatory requirements pose potential risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Espey here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding has invested around 200 million yuan (US$27.6 million) in artificial intelligence (AI) education start-up Zhejiang Jingzhunxue, as the Chinese e-commerce giant continues to bet heavily on the AI sector.\n\nHangzhou-based Jingzhunxue said on Wednesday that it received backing from Alibaba to support the development and promotion of the start-up's AI-powered education device, Bong. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nPowered by Alibaba's Qwen model and Jingzhunxue's self-developed large language model (LLM), Bong is a personalised and interactive teaching tool for students that provides AI-generated video lessons taught by digital teachers, according to the start-up's announcement. The product is set to be launched in June.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"The bottleneck in personalised education fundamentally lies in constraints on the supply side,\" Jingzhunxue chief executive Yang Renbin said in the statement, noting that China has a shortage of educators for its giant student population.\n\n\"AI is expected to completely resolve the challenge of achieving personalised teaching on a large scale,\" said Yang, who was formerly a technology director at Alibaba.\n\nThe investment comes as Chinese technology firms from Big Tech companies to new start-ups are scrambling to make money from generative AI technologies by applying them to various industries. Jingzhunxue, for example, focuses on the education sector.\n\nAlibaba itself has invested in a number of generative AI start-ups aspiring to build the leading alternatives to OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is officially unavailable in China.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company is a major backer of Moonshot AI, one of the country's hottest AI start-ups, Alibaba revealed in its annual report published last week.\n\nIn addition to its 36 per cent equity interest in Moonshot AI, Alibaba also has stakes in the three other start-ups that make up China's \"four new AI tigers\", namely Baichuan, Zhipu AI and MiniMax, according to data service provider ITJuzi.com, making the e-commerce giant one of the country's most prolific venture investors in the sector.\n\nApart from external investments, Alibaba has been working on its own Qwen series of large AI models, also known as Tongyi Qianwen, which have been integrated into its services, such as the workplace collaboration platform DingTalk.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's generative AI service market is becoming increasingly competitive.\n\nThe country's major tech giants, including Alibaba, Tencent Holdings and ByteDance, are waging a full-fledged LLM price war, offering steep discounts to entice users to their respective products and putting pressure on start-ups with smaller war chests.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Debt that can become equity has become all the rage in Asia, where issuers are increasingly turning to the instrument to get cheap money in an environment of high interest rates.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld\u2019s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida \u2018Not Gonna Be Pretty:\u2019 Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees \u2018Disturbance\u2019 in Medicaid China Weighs Record Fine for PwC Over Evergrande Audit Work\n\nThe notes denominated in US dollars have raised more than $9 billion this month, a record for the region, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd. accounted for almost all the proceeds.\n\nConvertibles, already common in the US and Europe, are increasingly becoming a favorite tool in Asia. For issuers, they offer unmatched flexibility to raise funds cheaply for things like buybacks without immediate stock dilution \u2014 both Alibaba and JD.com have massive repurchase plans. For hedge funds, it\u2019s an opportunity to arbitrage between the bond and the stock.\n\nAsia Pacific bankers are getting ready for more to come. The rebound in Chinese equities \u2014 those traded in Hong Kong are heading for their longest streak of monthly gains since 2021 \u2014 and the end of years of negative rates in Japan are making those markets particularly appealing to CBs.\n\n\u201cTraditional fund-raising methods such as corporate bonds or loans are less attractive given the high cost,\u201d said Christina Ma, head of global banking for Asia Pacific at HSBC Holdings Plc. \u201cWe would expect more liquid companies that have access to capital markets at essentially zero cost through CBs to come to market. This would be attractive for them.\u201d\n\nConvertibles are popular when borrowing costs are high because the hybrid notes\u2019 equity component typically means interest rate payments are lower than on regular debt. They also give investors the chance to profit should the underlying stock rise.\n\nFor big Chinese names that are just starting to rebound from slumps in the past two years, the notes can offer access to dollars that will help pay for American Depositary Receipt buybacks without having to navigate Beijing\u2019s capital controls. Alibaba and JD.com mentioned part of the proceeds from their CB offerings was to fund share repurchase programs in the US.\n\nIn Japan, homebuilding firm Daiwa House Industry Co. said earlier this year it would sell \u00a5200 billion ($1.3 billion) through convertibles denominated in yen, also to help fund buybacks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhat these companies did was basically a very good way to get money and buy back shares,\u201d said Selina Cheung, co-head of Asia equity capital markets at UBS Group AG in Hong Kong. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see more companies coming to market with the same strategy.\u201d\n\nTaiwan iPhone maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. launched the CB issuance spree this month, when it said it intended to raise as much as $700 million in what was expected to be the largest such offering of the year for an Asian issuer. Just days later, Alibaba came out with its record sale.\n\nStrong Demand\n\nThe notes sold by the Chinese e-commerce giant and JD.com attracted strong demand from hedge funds interested in an arbitrage opportunity that was crushed during the financial crisis. In a typical trade, investors would go long a convertible bond while shorting the underlying stock, allowing them to profit from the short if the shares fall or convert the bond into equity on maturity if they rise \u2014 all while getting coupon payments.\n\n\u201cThe hedge fund investors of the convertibles need to short stock as a hedge, and the company can take advantage of that supply of shares to execute a highly efficient buyback,\u201d said Rob Chan, head of equity-linked origination for Asia Pacific at Citigroup Inc. \u201cThis also mitigates impact on stock price during marketing.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Hedge Funds Return to Bond Trade With Checkered Past\n\nIn an entirely different approach to JD.com and Alibaba, Chinese PC giant Lenovo is planning the sale of $2 billion worth of zero-coupon CBs to Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The agreement is part of a broader strategic pact that includes a plan to build a research and development center in the kingdom and expand production capacity in that region.\n\n\u201cHistorically, companies that have issued converts have been mostly unrated because rated companies would typically go to the straight bond market,\u201d said Saurabh Dinakar, co-head of Asia Pacific global capital markets at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. \u201cBut given how high interest rates are, more investment grade companies are thinking about using the CB market as a way to reduce the ongoing cash-coupon cost.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy Dave & Buster\u2019s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos New York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Israel\u2019s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another \u2018Lost Decade\u2019 The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo's Race to Boost Supplies Yes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "HANGZHOU, China, May 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988 (HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), \"Alibaba,\" \"Alibaba Group\" or the \"Company\") today announced the completion of its private offering of US$5 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the \"Notes\"), which amount includes the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase an additional US$500 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the \"Option Exercise\"). In connection with the Option Exercise, the Company also entered into additional capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates and/or other financial institutions, using US$63.75 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional Notes. The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the ADSs and the ordinary shares of the Company upon conversion of the Notes by effectively increasing the conversion premium from approximately 30% to 100% over the last reported sale price of US$80.80 per ADS on the New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2024. The Notes have been offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\n\nThe initial conversion rate for the Notes is 9.5202 ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately US$105.04 per ADS. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30% over the last reported sale price of US$80.80 per ADS on the NYSE on May 23, 2024. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or following our delivery of a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event or such notice of redemption, as the case may be.\n\nThe Notes, the ADSs deliverable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, and the ordinary shares represented thereby or deliverable upon conversion of the Notes in lieu thereof, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and are being offered and sold in the United States only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\n\nAbout Alibaba Group\n\nAlibaba Group\u2019s mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. The Company aims to build the future infrastructure of commerce. It envisions that its customers will meet, work and live at Alibaba, and that it will be a good company that lasts for 102 years.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

        "title": "3 High-Growth Chinese Stocks That Are Massively Underpriced",
        "content": "If you\u2019re hesitant to buy stocks while broader stock markets are close to all-time highs, perhaps consider buying stocks abroad. At this juncture, Chinese stocks are becoming a temptation from a valuation perspective.\n\nSome Chinese internet giants are fresh off one of their worst multi-year spills in recent memory. And though the names may not be timely, it\u2019s tough to pass some bruised stocks, if you seek deep discounts on firms that are capable of high double-digit percentage growth over time.\n\nOf course, investing in Chinese stocks has been mostly a money-losing endeavor. And there\u2019s a good chance it could continue to be as China\u2019s economy battles through remaining headwinds. However, let\u2019s examine three high-growth Chinese stocks that risk-takers may wish to watch if they seek massive undervaluation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently, internet juggernaut Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) announced its intention to raise $4.5 billion via convertible bonds to buy back shares. Undoubtedly, BABA stock looks incredibly undervalued after shedding 74% of its value from its brief 2020 peak.\n\nThough the Chinese internet giant has a number of high-growth businesses to help power its comeback, I do think buybacks are a priority while BABA stock is still at multi-year depths. After all, buybacks are simply fantastic at times of severe undervaluation. Even as Alibaba goes big on the buybacks, don\u2019t expect the firm to shy away from AI spending.\n\nAnd, Alibaba\u2019s commerce businesses are largely dependent on the state of the Chinese economy (it\u2019s not in a good place these days). But, it has a footing in the AI race and the cloud, which are expanding. And while buybacks thrown in, count me as a big fan of BABA stock, even if shares are bound to stay grounded for a few more quarters.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nFormerly Pinduoduo, PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) has made great progress in recent years. It climbed back from its epic 2021 crash that wiped out close to 84% in market value in just over a year\u2019s time. Global e-commerce sensation Temu is a household name outside of China. And it could expand its presence and offerings further.\n\nThe e-commerce company is known for retailing cheap goods, some of which gained significant attention on social media. It has played an important role in PDD stock\u2019s comeback. The shares have gained 365% since the lows of 2022. At this pace, the company is nothing short of intriguing while it\u2019s going for 19.5 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a sensational first quarter that saw revenue grow 131% year-over-year (YOY), the magnitude of PDD\u2019s growth is becoming difficult to ignore. I think there\u2019s more such growth ahead, even if the multiple suggests PDD is more of a value play.\n\nLuckin Coffee (LKNCY) close up luckin coffee's logo coffee brand in Shanghai, June 2019.\n\nSource: NewsToday / Shutterstock.com\n\nLuckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY) is more speculative for investors betting on China\u2019s newfound taste for coffee. The coffee chain is expanding across the nation at a scorching rate as it clashes with the likes of Seattle-based coffee firm Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nIndeed, Luckin Coffee has encountered snags in the past, as it ran into trouble with its debt load. Lately, the situation has improved greatly. Management is finding ways to grow sales without heavily weighing down the balance sheet. Moving ahead, it will be interesting to see how the Chinese chain competes with Starbucks and other national rivals amid China\u2019s economic slide.\n\nEither way, coffee chains could be in for big gains as they hit the gas on their unit expansion plans. While such store growth could eat away at margins, it\u2019s the long-term narrative that\u2019s most worthy of investment.\n\nAt writing, shares are fresh off a 50% plunge from 52-week highs near $38 per share. At 14.7 times trailing P/E, LKNCY definitely looks like a deep value play. However, one that entails a great degree of risk as China continues navigating a horrid economic climate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Starbucks.

        "content": "Wednesday, May 29, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Coca-Cola Company (KO), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and KLA Corporation (KLAC), as well as two micro-cap stocks Mobile Infrastructure Corporation (BEEP) and Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp. (ESP). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (+5.0% vs. +3.4%). The company continues to witness positive business trends as reflected by its robust surprise history. KO\u2019s sales and earnings beat estimates for the fifth consecutive quarter in first-quarter 2024.\r\n\r\nEarnings and sales also improved year over year. Strong revenue growth across most of its operating segments aided by improved price/mix and unit volume growth boosted the results. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2024.\r\n\r\nHowever, KO witnesses inflationary cost pressures, related to higher commodity and material costs, as well as higher marketing investments.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alibaba have gained +2.1% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry\u2019s gain of +14.7%. The company is benefiting from strong momentum across its international business. Solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses and strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice are contributing well.\r\n\r\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business remains a major positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth. Strength in Lazada, AliExpress and Trendyol is expected to continue benefiting Alibaba\u2019s international business.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising expenses related to new initiatives are a concern. Macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations remain risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\r\n\r\nKLA\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the year-to-date period (+34.1% vs. +17.9%). The company is benefiting from strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development.\r\n\r\nGrowing adoption of KLA\u2019s 8900 series platform for high throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in its optical inspection portfolio in 2023.\r\n\r\nGrowing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry & Logic are driving the top-line growth. KLA's emphasis on integration of AI into its solutions has driven its outperformance in the semiconductor market.\r\n\r\nHowever, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind. Softness in memory and leading-edge, logic and foundry investments has been a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on KLA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Mobile Infrastructure have underperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Operations industry over the year-to-date period (-15.6% vs. -1.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $105.06 million is facing high debt levels, thus interest rate sensitivity poses a major risk. Limited revenue diversification, intense competition, seasonal variability, regulatory risks and work-from-home trends persist.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mobile Infrastructure owns a diverse portfolio of 42 parking assets in 21 major U.S. markets, ensuring steady demand and stable revenue streams. The portfolio, valued at $520 million in 2022, saw an 11.9% increase in net operating income (NOI).\r\n\r\nThe first quarter of 2024 revenue uptick was driven by organic growth and converting 26 assets to management contracts, improving operating efficiency. Increased utilization across key markets, advanced technology and proprietary analytics enhance pricing and demand. Financially stable with $13.9 million in cash and $192.1 million in debt, the company has a $300 million acquisition pipeline.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Mobile Infrastructure here >>>)\r\n\r\nEspey\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Military industry over the year-to-date period (+14.6% vs. +7.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $57.69 million is well positioned in the defense electronics market, Espey benefits from increasing demand for advanced systems. Its vertical integration allows high-quality production and flexibility.\r\n\r\nInnovation is driven by a $7.4 million U.S. Navy award for facility upgrades. However, competitive pressures, dependence on government contracts, declining net sales and stringent regulatory requirements pose potential risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Espey here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Aon plc (AON), Republic Services, Inc.

Low liquidity remains a concern.\n\nInnovations Aid Enphase (ENPH), Slow Demand in US Pose Risk\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Enphase frequently launches newer versions of microinverters to expand its market share. Yet slower demand environment in the United States pose a risk for this stock's growth\n\nNew Product Sales Aid UFP Industries (UFPI) Amid High Costs\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, UFP Industries benefits from accretive acquisitions and increased new product sales. However, high expenses and rapid lumber market swings are a concern.\n\nHigh-Quality Eagle Ford Acreage to Aid Magnolia (MGY)\r\nThe Zacks analyst believes that Magnolia Oil and Gas' high-quality acreage in the Eagle Ford provides it with attractive economics but is worried over lack of commodity price hedging.\n\nPortfolio Rationalization, Cost Cuts Buoy US Cellular (USM)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, US Cellular is likely to benefit from various cost-optimization initiatives to improve liquidity and reduce debt burden while rationalizing its portfolio for holistic growth.\n\nIntellia (NTLA) Banks on Genome Editing Pipeline Amid Rivalry\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Intellia's lead genome-editing candidate, NTLA-2001 being developed to treat transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis, holds promise. Stiff competition in the target market is a concern\n\nNew Upgrades\n\nApplied Industrial (AIT) Benefits From Strong Service Centre Segment\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Applied Industrial's Service Center segment is driven by an increase in demand for technical MRO support and fluid power MRO across the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nSolid Backlog & Strategic Acquisitions to Aid Oshkosh (OSK)\r\nThe Zacks analyst is optimistic about Oshkosh's strong consolidated backlog that provides enough visibility for the coming years.

        "content": "Temu's Growth Surge Makes Parent PDD Surpass Alibaba as China's Most Valuable E-Commerce Giant\n\nPDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) have played pivotal roles in China\u2019s e-commerce sector. PDD\u2019s value-for-money strategy and the growth of its Temu marketplace have helped it surpass Alibaba in market value, making it the most valuable company in the segment.\n\nPDD Holdings reported impressive first-quarter results, boosting its shares by 7.5% and raising its market capitalization to about $208 billion, compared to Alibaba\u2019s $196 billion, CNBC reports.\n\nPDD\u2019s revenue more than doubled, and profit almost tripled yearly, getting a boost from domestic marketplace strength and\u00a0international expansion of Temu.\n\nAnalysts attribute PDD\u2019s success to its cost-effective approach and strong consumer perception. Analysts projected continued strength for PDD from new markets and increasing penetration of opened markets, especially in Europe and Asia.\n\nMorningstar highlighted the profitability of Temu\u2019s half consignment model and PDD\u2019s solid market position.\n\nGoldman Sachsupgraded PDD\u2019s rating to \u201cbuy,\u201d citing its growth momentum in advertising revenue and Temu\u2019s potential.\n\nThe market has now priced in concerns about domestic competition and U.S.-China tensions. Analysts consider China eCommerce emerging as one of the more undervalued sub-sectors within China\u2019s internet.\n\nPDD\u2019s net income for the March quarter surged 246% year-on-year to $3.87 billion, while its revenue from transaction services increased by 327%. In contrast, Alibaba\u2019s net income dropped 86% to 3.3 billion yuan for the same period.\n\nPDD has also made significant international strides with Temu, rapidly expanding into markets like the U.S., Australia, and Europe.\n\nBofA noted Temu\u2019s strong positioning among its peers, leveraging the experience of its parent and sister companies.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba remains engaged in the geographical diversification of its cloud computing business.

        "content": "\u2018Big Short\u2019 investor Michael Burry just made a big bet on gold \u2014 and dumped tech giants Alphabet and Amazon\n\nMichael Burry\u2019s moves tend to make headlines.\n\nThe hedge fund manager famously bet against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and won big \u2014 a move that was depicted in the hit movie \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d\n\nSince then his investments have been closely watched.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control \u2014 use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nAccording to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Burry\u2019s company Scion Asset Management has made quite a few adjustments to its portfolio in Q1 of 2024.\n\nAmong Burry\u2019s notable moves were selling his stakes in Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) and increasing his holdings of Chinese companies JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA).\n\nBurry also made a substantial bet on gold by purchasing 440,729 shares of Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), valued at $7.6 million at the end of Q1, making it the fifth-largest position in his portfolio. The closed-end fund's official website says it holds \u201csubstantially all of its assets in physical gold bullion.\u201d\n\nA unique feature of the Sprott Physical Gold Trust is that investors have the right to redeem their units for physical metals on a monthly basis, provided they meet the minimum redemption amount. This requirement is quite substantial, as \"a unitholder must have enough units to equate to one full-sized London Good Delivery bar (approximately 400 oz).\"\n\nGold\u2019s gleaming rise\n\nGold is already experiencing a remarkable surge. At the beginning of this year, the precious metal was trading at $2,062 per ounce. Today, it\u2019s at $2,357 per ounce, reflecting a 14.3% increase.\n\nTo put this into perspective, gold has outpaced the S&P 500, which has gained 11.7% over the same period.\n\nThere are many reasons why investors might want to add gold to their portfolios. One notable reason is inflation. Inflation often arises from central banks' ability to freely print fiat money. Gold, however, cannot be created out of thin air. Its relative scarcity and durability make it a reliable hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power when paper currency loses value.\n\nAdditionally, gold can act as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tension. During periods of market volatility or global instability, investors often turn to gold for its stability and reliability. This precious metal has historically maintained its value, making it a trusted asset in uncertain times.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nFor those looking to follow Burry's lead and add a touch of gold to their portfolios, here are three easy ways to do it.\n\nBuy gold bullion\n\nThe most straightforward way to invest in gold is to buy physical gold in the form of bars or coins.\n\nGold bullion can be purchased from reputable dealers and stored securely at home or in a safety deposit box.\n\nThe advantage of owning physical gold is its stability and tangibility, providing a sense of security and ownership that isn't dependent on financial institutions. However, it requires secure storage and insurance, which can add to the overall cost of investment.\n\nInvest in gold stocks/ETFs\n\nInvestors can also purchase shares of gold mining companies. When the price of gold rises, miners tend to enjoy bigger profits, potentially boosting the value of their stocks.\n\nAdding gold mining companies to your portfolio can provide diversification. However, keep in mind that doing so also exposes investors to market risks and the performance of the underlying companies.\n\nIn addition, there are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of gold. These ETFs aim to mirror the price movements of gold by holding physical gold or gold futures contracts.\n\nBecause gold ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, investors have the ability to buy or sell shares at market prices throughout the trading day. They provide a convenient way to gain exposure to gold without the need for physical storage or dealing with the logistics of buying and selling bullion.\n\nInvest in a gold IRA\n\nIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are a popular way to save for retirement, offering tax advantages that can help grow your savings over time. Traditional IRAs allow you to contribute pre-tax income, with taxes deferred until you withdraw the funds during retirement. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, involve contributions made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\n\nA gold individual retirement account (IRA) is a specific type of IRA that allows investors to include physical gold and other precious metals in their retirement savings. This type of IRA offers the same tax advantages as traditional and Roth IRAs but provides the added benefit of diversifying your portfolio with tangible assets. Gold IRAs are appealing because gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, helping to protect your retirement savings from market volatility.\n\nThere are drawbacks, like relatively lower returns, no dividends and fees you have to pay to buy and store the actual metal.\n\nIf you believe in the yellow metal\u2019s long-term potential, a gold IRA could be a valuable addition to your retirement strategy. However, make sure it\u2019s only a small part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse.

        "content": "In today\u2019s market, anyone can look smart saying that stocks like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Meta (NASDAQ:META) are good investments. However, the best investments are often found by investors identifying overlooked stocks that the rest of the market has yet to catch up on. If you can enter these stocks at the right time, the returns have the potential to be life-changing over a long enough period. Imagine entering NVIDIA before it was a billion-dollar company!\n\nSo how can we identify these overlooked stocks ready to take the next step? Well, the best way is proper due diligence and research for fundamental catalysts like an industry-changing product, or stellar year-over-year financial growth. In this article, we\u2019ll highlight three such overlooked stocks that are still flying under the radar for most investors.\n\nDespegar.com (DESP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you are from the States, there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed if you have never heard of this company. Despegar.com (NYSE:DESP) is a leading Latin American online travel technology brand. As of now, six analysts have given DESP a projected one-year average price target of $14.42 and a high-end target of $19.00.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespegar.com offers a unique opportunity to invest in a regional travel industry flattened by the pandemic. It offers the largest selection of regional airlines and accommodations through an award-winning mobile or desktop app. Through its acquisition of Koin, Despegar has since entered the buy-now-pay-later market and is expected to continue growing its addressable market into entirely new customers. \r\n\r\nIn the most recent quarter, Despegar saw strong profitability and beat consensus earnings estimates by 120%.\u00a0However, while DESP is trading a minimal price multiple at just 1.6x sales, some investors might worry about larger fish entering the waters. While other incredible Latin American stocks like MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) are already eyeing DESP for a potential acquisition, we see DESP\u2019s current rise into the limelight as a great opportunity for investors to diversify into a relatively cheap local industry leader.\n\nPinDuoDuo (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinDuoDuo (NASDAQ:PDD) is usually not the first Chinese tech stock investors think of. It has often been overshadowed by stocks like AliBaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY). Wall Street analysts are well aware of the potential for PDD as they have an average price target of $201.09 with a street-high price target of $276.72. The high-end price target indicates more than 70% upside from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis company exploded during the pandemic with its agricultural eCommerce platform that connected farmers directly with consumers in China. Now, PinDuoDuo has launched its discount marketplace Temu in more than 50 markets worldwide. The result? PinDuoDuo reported a 130% year-over-year rise in revenue and 245% year-over-year growth in net income during the first quarter of 2024. Earnings-per-share jumped by 99% from the same quarter in 2023.\n\nPinDuoDuo has always traded with a China discount. Shares are trading at just 13x forward earnings and 5.5x sales. On a price multiple basis, the stock is cheaper now at a $218 billion market cap than when it had a $100 billion market cap. At this rate, don\u2019t be surprised if five or ten years from now, PinDuoDuo is the best-performing Chinese ADR stock on the market!\n\nOnOn Holdings (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe complete our list of three overlooked stocks with our third international company: OnOn Holdings (NASDAQ:ONON). In May, 16 of 21 analysts rated the stock a Buy or Strong Buy. They also have an average one-year price target of $39.66, with the highest target being $54.51.\n\nOnOn has taken the running apparel and footwear world by storm. You might not recognize the brand by name, which goes by On Cloud, but you have likely seen the unique-looking shoe styles. Earnings in the most recent quarter beat estimates by 128% and On saw a 105% year-over-year growth in quarterly net income. One of the biggest growth drivers behind this performance has been ONON\u2019s commitment to growing its number of high-profile investors and athletes including Roger Federer as a core marketing strategy.\n\nThe company is in high-growth mode right now and trades at a fairly high multiple. Shares trade at 42.7x forward earnings and 12.6x sales. With ONON expected to ramp up marketing again this summer and into the next Olympic games, investors should look out for key pullbacks for the chance to buy into this amazing growth trajectory.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Lenovo, the world's largest PC maker, is raising US$2 billion by issuing zero-coupon convertible bonds to a unit of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, close on the heels of similar offerings made by e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com as issuers seek to lower funding costs.\n\nThe three-year bonds will pay no interest but give the investor, Alat, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the option to convert its holdings into shares at an initial conversion price of HK$10.42 per share on the maturity date. This represents a discount of around 12 per cent from Tuesday's closing price, and the conversion of the entire holdings would release an additional 1.5 billion shares into the market or around 12.09 per cent of the capital base as of the announcement date.\n\nAlat has also entered into a strategic collaboration with the Chinese laptop maker, to help enhance its presence and spur growth in the Middle East and Africa markets, according to a stock market filing.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe net proceeds will be used for repaying debt as well as for funding general corporate and working capital purposes, Lenovo said. The company also announced a plan to set up a regional headquarters and a new manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Lenovo Group Ltd. concept ThinkBook laptop computer featuring a transparent display during a news conference in Hong Kong, China, on Thursday, May 23, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg alt=A Lenovo Group Ltd. concept ThinkBook laptop computer featuring a transparent display during a news conference in Hong Kong, China, on Thursday, May 23, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\n\"The company expects to have greater financial flexibility to implement its proven strategy, and will further drive its global transformation into a solutions and services-led business,\" Lenovo said.\n\nLenovo's bond plans emerged days after Alibaba's record US$4.5 billion sale and JD.com's US$2 billion offering, both issues being made to fund share buy-backs. More overseas-listed Chinese companies could follow suit, according to UBS.\n\n\"The issuance of convertible bonds is an attractive financing plan for companies, allowing them to obtain capital at a relatively low cost,\" Salina Cheung, co-head of Asia ECM, said in a media briefing on Tuesday. It will be \"no surprise\" to see more deals.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancing costs have risen substantially in a high interest rate environment, making convertibles more attractive to issuers compared to conventional bonds. The coupon rates on JD.com's 5-year convertible bonds and Alibaba's 7-year convertibles stand at 0.25 and 0.5 per cent respectively, compared to the 5.7 per cent yield on 5-7 year dollar-denominated bonds issued by Asian companies, according to an ICE Bank of America Index.\n\nFor investors, convertibles could offer both protection and extra income. Due to their built-in equity exposure, convertibles increase in value when the underlying stock price rises, while the bond floor establishes a minimum price that serves as a safety net during market downturns, according to Schroders.\n\nThe Lenovo-Alat collaboration also comes as China and Saudi Arabia continue to deepen their economic ties. PIF has been actively investing in Chinese tech companies, recently boosting its stake in Alibaba by 11 per cent.\n\nCiti is sole adviser to Lenovo's bond sales. Shares of the company fell 4 per cent on Wednesday to HK$11.34 on earnings dilution concerns.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The only \u2018trick\u2019 is finding stocks that fit that profile, and the key is right in front of us, waiting in the raw data of the stock market.\n\nTherein lies the rub. The markets toss up a huge volume of information, based on thousands of traders dealing in thousands of stocks \u2013 the result is millions of transactions every day, and it\u2019s the work of a lifetime to make sense of it all. Even Wall Street\u2019s best analysts will usually focus on a segment of the whole.\n\nThis is where the TipRanks Smart Score comes in. It\u2019s a data sorting and collating tool, based on a combination of AI and natural language processing, designed to gather all the data on any given stock and then compare that stock\u2019s performance to a set of factors known as accurate predictors of future outperformance. The stock\u2019s comparison results are then distilled into a single score, on a scale of 1 to 10. A stock that rings in at a \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 is one that has definitely earned additional investor interest.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true when market-leading companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are picking up the \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Scores. We\u2019ve used the TipRanks database to look up the bigger picture on both; these top-scoring stocks also bring Strong Buy ratings and double-digit upside potentials to the table. Here are the details.\n\nAlphabet\n\nFirst up, a giant of the tech world. Best known as the parent company of both Google and YouTube \u2013 Alphabet is the leader in the world of online search and holds a dominant position in online advertising and video content distribution. The company recently became just the fourth Wall Street firm to surpass $2 trillion in market cap, and is one of just six publicly traded companies with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. Currently, Alphabet is valued at $2.17 trillion.\n\nGiven its overall strong position in tech, Alphabet is at the forefront of development in the AI field, and is applying generative AI to its Google search engine, and to its Google Cloud subscription service. Alphabet even has an autonomous driving division, Waymo, that has put AI-based self-driving vehicles on the streets of San Francisco.\n\nAt the financial bottom line, Alphabet\u2019s earnings have been on an upward trajectory for the past year. In the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, covering 1Q24, Alphabet reported $1.89 in EPS, up from $1.17 in the prior year and 38 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company\u2019s revenues, which totaled $80.54 billion and beat the forecast by $1.84 billion, were powered by advertising revenue. Ad revenue for the quarter came to $61.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this \u2013 the solid business model, the tech leadership, and the strong finances \u2013 have caught the attention of Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth, who writes of Alphabet, \u201cSearch and Advertising revenue will continue to see accelerating growth, and the ongoing integration of AI functionality will continue to drive its leadership position across all key technology trends and business lines. GOOGL continues to benefit from strong advertising revenue and user engagement, driving another quarter of strong results across all key business lines, including Cloud, which continues to benefit from increasing AI integration.\u201d\n\nThe 5-star analyst goes on to give these shares a Buy rating with a $210 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 20%. (To watch Feinseth\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nLike most tech giants, Alphabet has picked up plenty of Wall Street recommendations \u2013 no fewer than 37, with 32 Buys and 5 Holds to back up the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in GOOGL are selling for $174.99 and the $197.53 average target price implies a gain of nearly 13% in the next 12 months. (See GOOGL stock forecast)\n\nAlibaba\n\nNext up is Alibaba, best known as the \u2018Amazon of China.\u2019 That\u2019s a bit unfair, really. Alibaba is a powerful online retail and services tech company in its own right. The company\u2019s founder is the near-legendary Chinese tech entrepreneur and innovator Jack Ma, and his creation is the absolute leader in China\u2019s domestic online retail market. The company has been in business since 1999, and has branched out beyond China\u2019s borders, and beyond ecommerce.\n\nThe company does offer a wide range of online retail services on the global market, and has moved into other tech sectors, including digital media, entertainment, and cloud computing. The company has several business segments, including innovation initiatives, but its chief business remains the Chinese Commerce segment.\n\nThat core business gives Alibaba a solid foundation to stand on. China has a population of approximately 1.4 billion, including approximately 800 million in its expanding urban regions. In its domestic market, Alibaba offers an unparalleled range of products and boasts that it can deliver anything to anywhere in China, with guaranteed next-day or 2-day delivery. The company\u2019s global online retail side features nearly 6,000 product categories and over 200,000 suppliers making more than 200 million products available in over 200 countries.\n\nAlibaba last reported financial results for fiscal 4Q24, which ended on March 31 of this year. The company\u2019s top line came to $30.73 billion, up 7% from the prior fiscal year Q4 and some $310 million over the estimates. The company\u2019s bottom line was reported as $1.40 by non-GAAP measures, missing the forecast by 2 cents per share.\n\nThis retail and tech company attracted a review from Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang, who thinks BABA\u2019s strengths outweigh potential headwinds. Jiang writes, \u201cKey drivers for the next leg of the stock, in our view, are 1) sustainability of positive market share dynamics, 2) ecommerce monetization improvement driven by new ad product launch (slated in F2H25) to close the gap of CMR and GMV; and 3) reaccelerated cloud growth bolstered by AI cloud (F2H25). Uncertainty remains in light of 1) GMV growth largely depends on consumer sentiment (recently improving); 2) investment may create profitability volatility in the near Qs and FY25. Net net, we are incrementally more comfortable for a potential full-fledged turnaround playing out in F2H25 along with a stabilizing macro backdrop.\u201d\n\nFor Jiang, another of the Street\u2019s 5-star stock pros, these shares have earned a Buy rating, along with a $118 price target that suggests a 45% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Jiang\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nBABA\u2019s 17 recent stock reviews include 14 Buys to 3 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, and the average target price, of $103.46, implies an upside of 27% from the current share price of $81.26.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point higher as traders return to their desks after a public holiday on Monday. The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure later in the week is due to headline this week's economic calendar, while an ebbing stream of corporate earnings could provide a glimpse into the health of the American consumer.\n\n1. Futures tick higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged into the green on Tuesday, with investors looking ahead to key inflation data during this holiday-shortened trading week.\n\nBy 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had added 9 points or 0.2%, Nasdaq 100 futures had gained 58 points or 0.3%, and Dow futures had climbed by 40 points or 0.1%.\n\nStock markets on Wall Street were closed for Memorial Day on Monday.\n\nHighlighting the economic calendar this week is May's personal consumption expenditures price index on Friday, widely known as the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. Fed officials have recently suggested that they would like to see more proof that price gains in the U.S. are sustainably cooling toward the central bank's stated 2% target before rolling out any potential interest rate cuts this year.\n\n2. Consumer confidence data ahead\n\nA relatively light schedule of economic releases Tuesday will feature the latest reading of the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey.\n\nAnalysts expect the May figure, which is viewed as a potential leading indicator of consumer spending, to fall slightly to a mark of 96.0, down from 97.0 in the previous month.\n\nThe number sank to its lowest level more than 1-1/2 years in April as Americans fretted over elevated prices for essentials like food and gas, as well as income and the availability of jobs.\n\n\"Confidence retreated further in April [....] as consumers became less positive about the current labor market situation,\" Dana Peterson, Chief Economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement.\n\n3. Earnings season ebbs\n\nThe quarterly parade of earnings continues to slow, although several companies are still gearing up to their unveil their latest returns in the coming days.\n\nAmong them is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), who will report following the close of markets on Wednesday. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have said that they expect the business software group to roughly meet Wall Street expectations thanks in part to a recovery in spending by small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nElsewhere, members-only retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and beauty store chain Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) are tipped to provide a further glimpse into the state of the U.S. shopper when they report after the bell on Thursday. Consumers have recently showed signs that they are paring back expenditures on nonessential items in response to sticky inflation and higher interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Alibaba Health surges\n\nHong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Health Information Technology (HK:0241) spiked on Tuesday after the firm clocked a jump in its annual earnings on improved margins and strong demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals on its platforms.\n\nThe company, which was acquired by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) in 2014, posted a nearly 91% surge in adjusted net profit to 1.44 billion yuan ($200 million) for the year to March 31.\n\nRevenue rose about 1% to 27.03 billion yuan, as sales appeared to be stagnating after COVID-led demand sparked stellar sales growth over the past three years. But Alibaba Health benefited from improved margins, especially on its online healthcare services, as well as pharmaceutical sales.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nCrude prices hovered around the flatline, rebounding from recent losses ahead of a meeting by major producers to decide future output levels.\n\nBy 03:23 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) inched up 0.2% to $78.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract traded down by 0.1% at $82.83 per barrel. Oil prices rose over 1% on Monday in muted trade owing to public holidays in the U.K. and the U.S., after sinking to the lowest levels since early-February last week.\n\nAll eyes are now on the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, which is set to take place online on June 2. Much of the focus will be on whether the cartel will extend its current voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day into the second half of the year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. futures tick higher, consumer confidence survey ahead - what's moving markets\n\nIsraeli-Turkish trade on life support as relations hit bottom\n\nLondon Stock Exchange Group Plc.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks moved in a tight range on Tuesday as investors shied away from big bets before a string of key inflation readings this week, while a U.S. market holiday also made for few trading cues.\n\nRegional markets saw some strength on Monday as China announced more stimulus measures, this time aimed at the local chipmaking industry. Chinese technology stocks saw extended gains on Tuesday on optimism over more stimulus.\n\nBut broader markets were largely depressed, as the U.S. Memorial Day holiday also made for few overnight cues.\n\nHong Kong boosted by tech rally, China flat\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was a standout performer in Asia, rising 0.9% after strong gains in the prior session. In contrast, China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes moved in a flat-to-low range.\n\nChinese tech stocks were cheered by the government announcing a new $47 billion fund aimed at supporting the local chipmaking industry, especially amid tight U.S. sanctions and tariffs against the country.\n\nSome positive earnings also boosted sentiment. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) Health Information Technology Ltd (HK:0241), which is a separately listed unit of the e-commerce giant, surged over 12% after clocking a strong jump in its profit for the year to March 31. The stock was also the biggest boost to the Hang Seng.\n\nStill, sentiment towards broader Chinese markets appeared to be cooling as investors waited to see just how the country will execute and fund its recent swathe of stimulus measures.\n\nAnticipation of key Chinese purchasing managers index data later this week also kept investors on edge.\n\nAsian stocks subdued ahead of inflation cues\n\nBroader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range before a string of key inflation readings from the region, and the U.S., due later in the week.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.2% as data showed retail sales grew less than expected in April, amid pressure from inflation and high rates. A monthly consumer price index inflation reading is also due on Wednesday.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index fell 0.4%, while the broader TOPIX lost 0.1%. Inflation data from Japan\u2019s capital is due later this week, and is likely to factor into the Bank of Japan\u2019s outlook on interest rates.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI traded sideways, while futures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, after the index briefly hit record highs in the prior session.\n\nBeyond Asia, key CPI readings from the eurozone are also due this week. But the biggest point of focus is PCE price index data- which is the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reading is due on Friday and is likely to factor into the outlook for rate cuts in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks tread water with inflation cues on tap\n\nShares nudge higher as US, EU inflation data loom\n\nArgentina's Milei swaps cabinet chief in major government shakeup\n\nView comments",

        "content": "David Tepper's AI Stock Picks: 3 Hidden Gems Amidst Big Tech Sell-Off\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nDavid Tepper, a prominent billionaire investor, has shown a strong inclination toward artificial intelligence (AI), with all his top-10 holdings linked to the sector.\n\nHowever, his enthusiasm for some of these artificial intelligence stocks has lately faded. During the first quarter, Tepper reduced his stakes in Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, and Nvidia. Instead, he made many more investments in three other companies linked to artificial intelligence.\n\n1. Alibaba Group Holding\n\nTepper\u2019s Appaloosa Management portfolio shows Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) as the biggest investment. After Tepper increased his investment by approximately 159% in the first quarter, the Chinese tech giant surpassed Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia. After a 17% increase in April and May, Alibaba\u2019s stock has surged nearly 11% year-to-date; hence, this action has already paid off.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s appealing valuation shares trading under 10.5 times forward earnings and a price-to-earning-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.82 probably drive Tepper\u2019s increasing interest in the company. The company\u2019s recent performance validates Tepper\u2019s confidence, with Alibaba posting a 7% year-over-year sales gain in Q1 and aggressively lowering pricing in the Chinese AI services market to propel expansion.\n\n2. Oracle\n\nAppaloosa Management raised its ownership in OracleCorp (NYSE:ORCL) by over 74% in Q1, driving the stock to rank ninth in Tepper\u2019s portfolio. Despite a slight drop in April, Oracle has enjoyed strong momentum, with its stock up roughly 20% this year. Oracle\u2019s forward-earnings multiple stays around 20 even with this increase, making it less expensive than many other major artificial intelligence firms.\n\nTepper probably finds Oracle's cloud business especially intriguing, with Oracle\u2019s cloud revenue skyrocketing 25% year over year to $5.1 billion in its most recent quarter. Strong demand for Oracle\u2019s Gen2 AI architecture, highlighted by CEO Safra Catz, drove expansion for the cloud unit.\n\n3. PDD Holdings\n\nPDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD) is now the ninth-largest investment in Appaloosa Management\u2019s portfolio. In Q1, Tepper bought almost 1.3 million shares of the Chinese IT company, raising his ownership by around 171%. PDD runs Temu, a new online marketplace aiming worldwide, and Pinduoduo, a well-known e-commerce site in China.\n\nDespite a difficult Q1, PDD has rallied impressively, with shares declining over 25%. This is supported by positive Q1 numbers showing a 131% year-over-year sales rise and a tripling of adjusted profitability. With shares trading at 16.4 times forward earnings and a PEG ratio of 0.71, Tepper most likely values PDD\u2019s valuation and sees Temu\u2019s expansion approach as a good long-term growth driver.\n\nStory continues\n\nRound Out Your Portfolio With This High-Yield Alternative Investment\n\nWhile these three AI stocks offer the potential for significant growth, no investment portfolio is complete without income-producing assets that can provide consistent positive returns through all market cycles.\n\nOne such opportunity is the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple.\n\nThe Ascent Income Fund targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions, offering a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors.\n\nOne of the key advantages of this high-yield fund is its focus on first-mortgage loans. Each loan and borrower is carefully underwritten and subject to the institutional standards employed by the EquityMultiple investments team. The underlying properties may span geographies and property types/sectors to provide economic diversification. The Fund targets a max LTV of 75% on a whole-loan basis, with most first-liens coming in below 65% LTV, potentially mitigating risk on behalf of investors.\n\nInvestors in the Ascent Income Fund have redemption options after one year, providing a level of liquidity not often seen in real estate investments. The Fund targets 11-13% net annualized returns, with distributions paid quarterly.\n\nFirst-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Ascent Income Fund and start generating a reliable, high-yield income stream.\n\nThis article David Tepper's AI Stock Picks: 3 Hidden Gems Amidst Big Tech Sell-Off originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

The company currently offers five-day online-shopping delivery in Germany, France and Portugal, in addition to the US, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, supported by Alibaba's smart logistics network Cainiao.\n\nThe European Championship, which takes place every four years, is the world's most watched football tournament after the World Cup.

        "content": "By Casey Hall\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - AliExpress, an e-commerce site owned by Chinese giant Alibaba, has signed former England soccer captain David Beckham as a brand ambassador as it plays catch-up with rival PDD Holdings' Temu in a battle to sell cheap made-in-China goods to the world.\n\nA low-key cross-border player until recently, Alibaba is now investing aggressively to boost global sales as domestic e-commerce growth wanes. Its international division, which includes AliExpress, is its fastest growing unit with revenues surging 45% year on year over January to March.\n\nEarlier this year, AliExpress also signed on as a sponsor of the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament, which starts in June, where it will invest millions of dollars in discounts, deals and engagement to attract online consumers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn advertisement campaign featuring Beckham will run in conjunction with the UEFA tournament and encourage consumers to \"score more with AliExpress\", the e-commerce platform said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThis comes after the success of a move by PDD Holdings' Temu to air multiple commercials at the Super Bowl this year encouraging U.S. consumers to \"shop like a billionaire\".\n\nAccording to mobile intelligence firm Apptopia, Temu's app downloads jumped 34% on Super Bowl Sunday from the day before.\n\n\"Football, soccer, fans (in Europe and) Latin America are a similar demographic to American football fans in North America, they are generally going to include a lot of price-sensitive, inflation-impacted consumers,\" said Humphrey Ho, U.S. managing partner at digital advertising agency Hylink Digital, about the decision by Temu and now AliExpress to focus on football fans.\n\nCOMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\n\nThough Alibaba has long looked at the overseas market as a potential money maker, with founder Jack Ma saying in 2017 that Alibaba aimed to serve 2 billion global consumers by 2036, it is having to make up ground in many markets ceded to rival Temu.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Historically, execution has been the problem for Alibaba's international ambitions,\" said Jianggan Li, founder and CEO of Momentum Works, a venture and insights firm.\n\n\"Alibaba spent years debating whether it would be too difficult or too challenging to compete with Amazon (in the U.S.), and Temu just went ahead and did it.\"\n\nTemu, which sells $5 earbuds and $10 dresses among other things to over 60 global markets, has grown in popularity since its 2022 launch, with Chinese investment management firm CICC estimating Temu raked in $18 billion in revenue in 2023.\n\nPDD does not break out revenue for Temu separately and does not comment on the accuracy of third-party sales estimates.\n\nTo better compete with rivals, Alibaba is now utilizing its competitive advantages, offering five-day delivery windows to 11 markets on a selection of products, backed by its investments in global logistics.\n\nThe buyback of logistics arm Cainiao in March will likely strengthen the logistical advantages AliExpress has over rivals.\n\nAliExpress has a presence in more than 100 markets.\n\nAlibaba has the will and the money to pump into growth for AliExpress, but most importantly, the competitive landscape is forcing the issue, changing the dynamics of cross-border e-commerce from China, Li said.\n\n\"AliExpress has to find a way to compete with and differentiate from Temu\" in order to win market share, Li said.\n\n\"I mean, there's no other choice.\"\n\n($1 = 0.9218 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Casey Hall; Editing by Himani Sarkar)",

To understand Baidu\u2019s progress, look at its most recent earnings report. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year to $4,365 million, and net income decreased 6%.\n\nMobile users increased by 3% year-over-year, and Baidu\u2019s cloud services brought in an additional 6% revenue from Q1 last year. Other departments, such as online marketing and autonomous driving, also grew. While Baidu is performing well, high operating costs and struggles in the fiercely competitive advertising market weigh on income and cash.\n\nBaidu offers an opportunity due to its low valuation and continued investments in promising areas like AI and autonomous driving. It has already displayed its determination to continue making these investments. The company is optimistic that it can maintain a healthy margin and steady growth for years with optimized operational efficiency.\n\nAlibaba Group (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is China\u2019s largest e-commerce platform, with over 900 billion active users last year. Despite its massive platform and excellent long-term performance, Alibaba is trading at a meager price. Alibaba took the full brunt of regulatory crackdowns and restrictions, which slowed the company\u2019s progress but it is not down for the count.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fiscal 2024, ending Mar. 31, Alibaba reported an 8% increase in revenue and a 9% increase in net income year-over-year. While cash was slightly down compared to 2023, the spread of this revenue growth makes Alibaba an exciting stock.\n\nAlibaba is another company that wears several hats. Its massive e-commerce platform, cloud intelligence and digital media departments all function at total capacity, and all three saw growth in fiscal 2024.\n\nWhile e-commerce trends almost directly reflect the state of the Chinese economy and consumer spending, the company\u2019s diverse revenue gives it encouraging solidarity. This has allowed it to maintain a steady upward trend despite economic and regulatory challenges.\n\nAlibaba initiated a buyback of $12.5 billion in shares in fiscal 2024 and is returning to the sector\u2019s top. Investors may want to buy while they still can.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is another major player in the Chinese e-commerce sphere. While the stock has not had the best performance historically in past years, its most recent earnings might indicate a reversal of that momentum.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, JD beat earnings estimates with a 7% revenue growth year-over-year, with increases in product, logistics, and service revenues. JD specializes in retailing at low prices but also reported a rise in the retail sector\u2019s cross-margin, significantly impacting overall revenue.\n\nJD is seeing great advancements in its advertising efforts, with optimized traffic allocation for first- and third-party advertisers. Other initiatives include enhancing user experience with a lower threshold for free shipping and sponsorships, which increased shopping frequency and user volume.\n\nWhile this quarter was promising, JD has a long way to go before it returns to its top performance. Investors willing to stomach the risk and have faith in JDs ability to climb back to glory have an excellent opportunity in this stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding has emerged as a major backer of Moonshot AI, one of China's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) start-ups, holding a 36 per cent stake in the firm, according to the e-commerce giant's annual report.\n\nAlibaba has \"invested a total of approximately US$0.8 billion (about RMB5.9 billion) for an approximately 36 per cent equity interest\" in Moonshot AI in the past fiscal year 2024, the company said in its annual report filed with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday.\n\nThat values Beijing-based Moonshot AI, also known as Yuezhi Anmian in Chinese, at approximately US$2.2 billion, which is close to the figures reported by local media in February.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nMoonshot AI was said to be raising more than US$1 billion at a lofty US$2.5 billion valuation at the time, according to local outlets including 36Kr.\n\nAlibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, is among a group of Chinese tech heavyweights that have been scrambling to offer a local rival to ChatGPT, ever since that generative AI technology was debuted in November 2022 by San Francisco-based start-up OpenAI.\n\nChina tech firms, from search engine giant and AI pioneer Baidu to social media and video gaming powerhouse Tencent Holdings, have gone into overdrive to spawn their own ChatGPT-type products.\n\nAlibaba has backed all of the country's four new \"AI Tigers\", including Beijing-based Baichuan and Zhipu AI, Shanghai-based MiniMax, as well as Moonshot AI, according to start-up data service ITJuzi.com, making it one of the most prolific backers of the country's future AI champions.\n\nThat enthusiasm is also shared by Shenzhen-based Tencent, which has so far invested in three of the AI tigers, save for Moonshot.\n\nHowever, Tencent is in talks with Moonshot for the firm's new round of financing at a lofty US$3 billion valuation, the Post reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nApart from external investments, Alibaba has been working on its own AI models, the Tongyi Qianwen series, that have been used across a range of its own services including its Slack-like online workspace platform DingTalk.\n\nAlibaba CEO Eddie Wu Yongming has emphasised how much the firm values the potential of AI, which was listed as a strategic direction in a shareholder letter Wu co-authored with chairman Joe Tsai on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The second strategic direction is our focus on AI as the single most powerful element that will change and accelerate the growth of our businesses,\" the letter said, with AI mentioned 15 times in the more than 1,400-word long document.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Certain technology companies get all the attention and generate all the media headlines.\u00a0This fact leaves many companies lurking in the shadows and off\u00a0the radar screens of investors. This is a sorry state of affairs as it means that investors are\u00a0missing out on great stocks,\u00a0a lot\u00a0of which can be purchased now at bargain prices even as they begin to rise again and post solid returns.\n\nLittle-known stocks in the semiconductor, e-commerce, financial technology and cryptocurrency sectors are flying out of most investors\u2019 view. But with a\u00a0little\u00a0curiosity and research,\u00a0some diamonds in the rough can be unearthed. These include\u00a0some\u00a0former high-flying stocks that fell on hard times in recent years but are now staging a comeback and ripe for the picking.\n\nHere are three\u00a0tech stocks flying under the radar but ready to soar 50% higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor company that doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention. However, the company just reported better-than-expected earnings and lifted its forward guidance, sending its share price up 9% as a result. Analog Devices announced EPS of $1.40 for what was its fiscal second quarter. That beat analysts\u2019 consensus forecasts of $1.26. Revenue in the period totaled $2.16 billion, which beat expectations for $2.11 billion.\n\nAnalog Devices, which makes semiconductors used in data conversion and signal processing, attributed the strong results to\u00a0rising demand for its automotive and industrial microchips following a prolonged slump\u00a0coming out of\u00a0the pandemic.\u00a0Looking ahead, the company raised its forecast for the current quarter, saying it expects revenue of $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Analysts had forecast $2.16 billion in fiscal Q3 sales.\n\nADI stock has gained 140% over the last five years.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nFinancial technology firm\u00a0Block (NYSE:SQ) is another technology company that\u2019s on the rebound. The company led by founder Jack Dorsey recently reported Q1 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines, sending its stock up 7% in a single day. SQ stock is now up 72% from a low it reached last year on Halloween. In addition to its digital payments app, Block is also a\u00a0major\u00a0holder of Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nFor Q1 of this year, Block announced an EPS of 85 cents compared to 72 cents, which was estimated by analysts. The\u00a0profit more than quadrupled from a year ago. Revenue in the quarter totaled $5.96 billion versus $5.82 billion\u00a0that\u00a0was\u00a0expected\u00a0on Wall Street. Block said\u00a0that its\u00a0Cash App monthly active users reached 24 million at the end of March. Also, the company said that the $220 million it invested in Bitcoin had grown 160% to $573 million at the end of Q1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis technology company is a little riskier.\u00a0But if you believe that the Chinese economy\u00a0is going to\u00a0stage a comeback,\u00a0then\u00a0you may want to consider a position in e-commerce giant\u00a0Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).\u00a0Despite a struggling economy and\u00a0years long\u00a0crackdown on publicly traded tech firms by authorities in Beijing, Alibaba has managed to hold its own. The tech giant recently reported Q1 results that were\u00a0inline\u00a0with Wall Street expectations.\n\nAlibaba reported Q1 EPS of 18 cents and revenue of $30.70 billion for\u00a0what was\u00a0its fiscal fourth quarter. The profit figure was\u00a0inline\u00a0with analyst forecasts and the company\u2019s revenue\u00a0came in\u00a0higher than the $30.50 billion that was penciled in. In addition to being\u00a0China\u2019s leading e-commerce concern, Alibaba is also one of the country\u2019s top AI firms, integrating\u00a0the\u00a0technology wherever it can.\n\nInterestingly, BABA stock is one of the few securities that investor Michael Burry of the \u201cBig Short\u201d fame has continued buying in recent quarters. So far in 2024, BABA stock has gained 11%. However, the share price remains down 4% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 24, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Onespan OSPN as the Bull of the Day and Alibaba BABA as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Block, Inc. SQ, Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nOnespan is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that has a D for Value and an A for Growth. This is a security software company that focuses on e-signatures and fraud protection. Let's explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.\n\nDescription\n\nOneSpan Inc. provides software services. The Company designs and develops security software and e-signature solutions which protects devices and financial transactions from fraud and misuse. It delivers risk analytics, mobile security and authentication services. OneSpan Inc., formerly known as Vasco Data Sec, is based in Chicago\n\nEarnings History\n\nWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.\n\nFor Onespan, I see three straight beats and one miss of the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last year. The average positive earnings surprise over the last year works out to be a positive 501%.\n\nTwo quarters ago the company posted EPS of $0.19 when $0.01 was expected. That 18 cent beat translated into a positive earnings surprise of 1,800% and skewed the average over the last year.\n\nEarnings Estimates Revisions\n\nEarnings estimates revisions is what the Zacks Rank is all about.\n\nThe consensus estimate for the current quarter has held still at $0.19\n\nNext quarter has no estimate at the moment on the Zacks system.\n\nThe full fiscal year 2024 estimate has moved from $0.99 to $1.07 over the last 60 days.\n\nNext year has moved from $1.16 to $1.21.\n\nValuation\n\nThe forward PE multiple for OSPN is 11.8x which is well below the market multiple and the multiple of many of its peers. The price to book multiple comes in at 2.8x and the price to sales multiple checks in at 1.97x. The company has seen operating margins flip from negative 7.5% to a positive 4.4% over the last three quarters. When a company has good revenue growth and an increase in operating margins they will often also see an increase in EPS.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nAlibaba is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as earnings estimates have tracked lower after a recent earnings beat. The company s. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.\n\nStory continues\n\nDescription\n\nAlibaba Group Holding is one of the leading e-commerce giants in China. Over the last few years, the company has transformed itself from being a traditional e-commerce company to a conglomerate that has businesses ranging from logistics and food delivery to cloud computing.\n\nEarnings History\n\nWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, I see three beats and one miss of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The most recent quarter was a beat with the company posting $1.40 when $1.24 was expected. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn't make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.\n\nThe Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For BABA I see annual estimates moving lower of late.\n\nThe current year (2024) consensus number moved lower from $8.99 to $8.26 over the last 60 days.\n\nThe next year has moved from $10.10 to $9.17 over the last 60 days.\n\nNegative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIt should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Crypto Stocks to Watch Closely for Bitcoin's Bullish Run\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (BTC) gained momentum in 2021 due to institutional adoption but took a beating in 2022 amid regulatory and environmental issues. However, Bitcoin had a prodigious 2023, with the price of the flagship cryptocurrency surging 157%. The bullish momentum continued in 2024, with Bitcoin's price scaling past the $60,000 mark in early March and soaring above the $71,000 threshold in early May 21.\n\nThe Federal Reserve official's recent concerns about price pressures, with many remaining hesitant to trim interest rates soon, regrettably, dampened the price of Bitcoin on May 22. Bitcoin is trading slightly above the $69,000 mark, but crypto market aficionados expect the bullish run to continue as long as the price doesn't breach this level.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has already soared more than 50% so far this year, easily surpassing equities and bonds. And the upward trajectory is poised to last mostly due to the regulatory approval of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Morningstar Direct confirmed that the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $7 billion through the end of February.\n\nThanks to the regulatory approvals, retail and institutional investors have gained exposure to the world's numero uno cryptocurrency through brokerage accounts. This has legitimized Bitcoin's status as a credible asset class, which should help its price scale upward in the near future. The likelihood of spot ether ETF is also expected to drive Bitcoin's rally. The SEC has asked the exchanges aiming to list ether ETFs to update their 19b-4 filings.\n\nMoreover, strong bipartisan support has recently helped the House of Representatives pass a landmark crypto bill. Almost all the Republicans and 71 Democrats voted in favor of the crypto legislation, a tell-tale sign that Washington has faith in the trustworthiness of the digital asset sector. The shifting stance of the Biden administration no doubt bodes well for the price of Bitcoin and other digital coins.\n\nThus, with things looking hunky-dory for Bitcoin, astute investors should keep an eye on stocks that can make the most the Bitcoin's relentless bullish run. Some of the notable names are Block, Inc., Coinbase Global, Inc. and NVIDIA Corp..\n\nDigital payment company Block generates revenues from products like Cash App. In this platform, Bitcoin is purchased and sold. Block can increase its customer base substantially and boost profit margins. Block currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Block's current-year earnings has increased by 2% over the past 60 days. Block's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 73.9%. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current year is 15.1%.\n\nCoinbase is a crypto trading platform where several digital assets, including Bitcoin, are traded. Coinbase currently has a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coinbase's current-year earnings has increased by 357.3% over the past 60 days. Coinbase's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 1,840.5%. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current year is 83.5% (read more: 2 Stocks in Cathie Wood's Portfolio to Watch Now).\n\nSemiconductor giant NVIDIA is designing GPUs for mining cryptos such as Bitcoin. NVIDIA recently reported first-quarter earnings results, ending on Apr 28, 2024, which shattered Wall Street expectations. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's current-year earnings has increased by 2.5% over the past 60 days. NVIDIA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 89.2%. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current year is 77.7%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.\n\nDescription\n\nAlibaba Group Holding is one of the leading e-commerce giants in China. Over the last few years, the company has transformed itself from being a traditional e-commerce company to a conglomerate that has businesses ranging from logistics and food delivery to cloud computing.\n\nEarnings History\n\nWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.\u00a0 This tells me right away where the market\u2019s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.\u00a0 A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.\u00a0 That is what you want to see.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, I see three beats and one miss of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The most recent quarter was a beat with the company posting $1.40 when $1.24 was expected. \u00a0This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn\u2019t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.\n\nThe Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower.\u00a0 For BABA I see annual estimates moving lower of late.\n\nThe current year (2024) consensus number moved lower from $8.99 to $8.26 over the last 60 days.\n\nThe next year has moved from $10.10 to $9.17 over the last 60 days.\n\nNegative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIt should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions.\u00a0 That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding is selling up to US$5 billion worth of convertible bonds to fund its share buy-backs, as leaders of the Chinese tech giant declared e-commerce and cloud computing as its core businesses in a move \"towards strategic clarity\".\n\nThe Hangzhou-based firm, which owns the South China Morning Post, said it expects to raise close to US$4.5 billion from initial sales, while giving purchasers the option to buy up to an additional US$500 million of notes, according to filings made to the Hong Kong and New York stock exchanges on Friday and Thursday.\n\nThe offering, which is Asia's largest-ever convertible bond transaction and the world's biggest since 2008, has received positive market response and was oversubscribed multiple times, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because the information is private.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAlibaba's latest move demonstrates the management's confidence in the company's fundamentals, according to one of the sources. The firm chose to issue convertible bonds rather than US-dollar bonds because they entail lower financing costs, and conversion will only be triggered after the price of Alibaba's American depositary shares (ADS) reaches US$161.6, the person said.\n\nAn advertisement for Alibaba's Tmall e-commerce platform at a subway station in Shanghai. Photo: Bloomberg alt=An advertisement for Alibaba's Tmall e-commerce platform at a subway station in Shanghai. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nThe company announced in the first quarter it would spend US$4.8 billion to buy 524 million ordinary shares, equivalent to 65 million ADS, marking its most aggressive stock buy-back since 2021. It has repurchased a total of US$12.5 billion shares in its financial year ended March.\n\nOn Thursday, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai and chief executive Eddie Wu Yongming sent out their first letter to shareholders since taking the reins from Daniel Zhang Yong last September, saying the company is returning to a start-up mindset.\n\n\"In the past 25 years, Alibaba has grown consistently, but acquired 'large company' characteristics,\" the letter read. \"For the next 10 years, we see ourselves again as a start-up defined by entrepreneurship, innovation and our mission 'to make it easy to do business anywhere'.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTsai and Wu highlighted e-commerce and cloud computing as Alibaba's two core businesses. This comes after the company announced in March last year a sprawling restructuring that would carve out six independently-run entities from the firm, but later cancelled plans to launch separate initial public offerings for the Cainiao smart logistics operation and Alibaba Cloud.\n\nThe leaders said Alibaba's domestic and international e-commerce units - Taobao and Tmall Group and International Digital Commerce Group - now sit at the centre of the group's core e-commerce business, while other divisions such as Cainiao and on-demand delivery business Ele.me are expected to bring \"synergies that make our e-commerce businesses more valuable\".\n\nAlibaba also aims to be the \"leading public cloud infrastructure and platform technology provider in China\".\n\nThe leaders also reiterated two strategic directions first announced by Wu when he took office: \"user first\", which prioritises user experiences in business strategy and product design to drive retention and repeat purchases, and \"focus on AI\".\n\n\"Each of our businesses has massive numbers of use cases, all of which can use AI applications to unleash powerful value, and the deployment of AI will increase demand for computing and drive growth for Alibaba Cloud,\" Tsai and Wu wrote. Alibaba aims to be the \"leading public cloud infrastructure and platform technology provider in China\", they said.\n\nThe company will continue to invest for two purposes: to accelerate growth in its core businesses and to maintain leadership in fundamental technologies and innovations, including artificial intelligence.\n\nThe leaders said the company is taking a \"long-term perspective when making hard decisions\".\n\n\"We think in 10-year cycles as the development cadence of technology businesses typically experience the phases of investment, growth, harvest, profit, and invariable decline,\" they wrote.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. sold $4.5 billion worth of convertible bonds, a record dollar-denominated sale by an Asian company, securing capital needed to buy back shares and invest in businesses including artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSingapore Air Changes Seatbelt Rules After Fatal Turbulence SpaceX Weighs Plan to Sell Shares at $200 Billion Valuation Nvidia Stock Surges as Sales Forecast Delivers on AI Hopes China\u2019s $538 Billion Deposit Exodus Supercharges Rally in Bonds The Rise and Fall of Simon Sadler's Segantii, One of Asia's Most Successful Hedge Funds\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce pioneer priced the notes due 2031 with a coupon of 0.5% and a conversion premium of 30%. The deal was about six times oversubscribed, with about 250 investors on the book, a banker involved in the transaction said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\n\nAlibaba is taking advantage of cheap financing costs as well as a sharp rally in its shares to raise money, analysts said. The firm needs funds to invest in its core businesses and the cloud, both of which have bled market share during a crackdown on the sector by Chinese authorities and subsequent internal turmoil. At the same time, the sale signals its view that the stock is severely undervalued.\n\nPart of the proceeds from the offering will be used to repurchase 14.8 million of its American depositary receipts at the time the deal is priced, as well as to fund future buybacks, Alibaba said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe move is an opportunity to obtain cash offshore on favorable terms, at a 0.5% rate,\u201d said John Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. \u201cThis way they can start executing a share buyback right away, which the company can say is more beneficial to shareholders as the buyback will be more than the dilution.\u201d\n\nRead more: Alibaba\u2019s $25 Billion Buyback Fails to Assuage Investors\n\nThe offering by Alibaba is the biggest dollar-denominated equity-linked debt issuance by an Asian company on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It eclipses an issuance of $2.9 billion in five-year notes by Singapore\u2019s Sea Ltd. in September 2021, the data show.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s deal drew strong participation from US-based funds, the banker said, adding that the company has been in touch with banks for the convertible bonds sale for a few months. Given the firm\u2019s objective of repurchasing shares associated with this transaction, investors who wanted to buy the convertible debt and sell stock as a hedge against it were given priority, the person added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Mechanism\n\nConvertible bonds allow companies to borrow funds at lower rates than regular market borrowings, though such offerings can hurt the issuer\u2019s stock price because of the possibility that the debt will be changed into shares.\n\nAlibaba will allow investors to convert their bonds into shares if the price of ADRs rises 30% from current levels. In that case, it may mean that Alibaba will need to issue new shares to deliver them to the investors, causing an earnings dilution risk. To lower that risk, the firm has embedded a feature of so-called \u201ccapped call transactions\u201d in the convertible bonds, according to the exchange filing.\n\nThe feature is similar to a bull call spread, which consists of one long call with a lower strike price, and one short call with a higher strike price. In this deal, Alibaba will buy call options with strike price at 30% above current share price, and sell call options with strike price at 100% above current price. The mechanism could help ease earnings dilutive pressure, until a much higher share price.\n\nLocking In\n\nShares of Chinese tech firms have been rallying since February, as the government signaled more support for the industry while cheap valuations lured investors. Alibaba\u2019s sale takes place after rival online retailer online retailer JD.com Inc. earlier in the week sold a total of $2 billion of convertible bonds due in five years.\n\nTech companies are trying \u201cto lock in offshore US dollars to maintain the flexibility in doing share buybacks while investing overseas,\u201d said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Intrinsic Emerging Markets Equity. \u201cWe are somewhat disappointed by the low conversion premium which could suggest that Alibaba\u2019s transformation to resume growth is taking longer than expected.\u201d\n\nHangzhou-based Alibaba\u2019s newly installed leaders have signaled to the market for months that they view their company as severely undervalued \u2014 and in some cases, putting their money where their mouths are. Co-founder Jack Ma and his longtime lieutenant Joe Tsai \u2014 who returned to take the helm as Chairman in September \u2014 bought Alibaba stock for the first time in years at the start of 2024.\n\nIts ADRs surged almost 29% in the month to May 17. The stock has come under pressure this week after the company led the way in cutting prices on some cloud and artificial intelligence services, spurring concerns about a price war in China\u2019s nascent AI market.\n\nThe ADRs closed down 2.3% at $80.80 on Thursday. Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares finished 0.6% lower on Friday.\n\nThe company is seeking to strike a balance between returning cash and investing in existing and new businesses, including in artificial intelligence, Tsai and Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence says:\n\nAlibaba\u2019s convertible bonds offering may increase scrutiny of changes to its plans for a primary listing in Hong Kong by the end of August and the timeline for achieving a double-digit return on invested capital. The company\u2019s intention to use the bonds\u2019 proceeds for share purchases was more targeted than JD.com\u2019s. \u2014 analysts Catherine Lim and Trini Tan.\n\nTsai and Wu are reinvesting in Alibaba\u2019s core commerce business now, even as it tries to claw back its share of the cloud services market from state-backed rivals such as as China Telecom Corp. That\u2019s particularly critical as the company tries to stake its claim on the booming AI arena \u2014 a market where no one company can claim to have an unassailable lead.\n\nJust this week, the company announced it was setting up in Mexico for the first time, while unveiling a plan to build at least six datacenters in key markets including Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, South Korea over the next three years.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s convertible bonds were marketed at an annual coupon of 0.25% to 0.75%, and at a 30% to 35% conversion premium, according to terms of the deal reviewed by Bloomberg News earlier.\n\nThe offering \u2014 which the company said included a so-called greenshoe option that may increase the deal size by $500 million \u2014 adds to an already busy month for convertible bond issuance. Globally, there have been $10.2 billion worth of such deals this month, dwarfing April\u2019s $4 billion tally, after a pause for the earnings season interrupted a string of $10-billion plus months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s offering is expected to close on May 29, the company said. Holders of the convertible bonds can ask it to buyback all or part of their notes on June 1, 2029.\n\nCitigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc helped arrange the deal, according to terms seen earlier by Bloomberg News.\n\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang, Jeanny Yu, Ken Wang, Edwin Chan and Xi Wang.\n\n(Adds more details in the second, seventh, ninth and 10th paragraphs.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t TikTok Video Playing on Finance Bro Stereotype Becomes a Viral Hit The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019 Google\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alibaba raises $5 billion for share buybacks as it warns of AI challenges",
        "content": "Alibaba is raising $5bn from issuing convertible bonds, calling into question the Chinese ecommerce group\u2019s ability to tap its huge cash piles to repurchase shares.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company on Friday said it was issuing $4.5bn of notes convertible into stock at $105.04 per share and due in 2031, with a 0.5 per cent coupon. The issuance includes a $500mn overallotment, which a person familiar with the matter said would be exercised.\n\nThe group said it would use the raised cash primarily to buy back shares at the current price of $80.80, fund future share repurchases, and enter into transactions to offset some of the dilution should its share price reach the convertible price.\n\nThe complex financing deal comes as Alibaba aims to continue its large share buybacks while embarking on a steep investment programme to continue its push into generative artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cOver the next decade, no industry will be spared the disruption brought about by AI,\u201d chair Joe Tsai and chief executive Eddie Wu wrote in a letter to shareholders on Thursday, noting that AI would \u201cchange and accelerate\u201d their business.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t keep up with the constant and marvellous improvements that AI is showing us on a daily basis, we will be displaced,\u201d they warned.\n\nThey said developing large language models would require significant investment, and only be viable for large, profitable tech companies such as Alibaba.\n\nNoting that Alibaba over the past two decades had \u201cunfortunately, acquired \u2018large company\u2019 characteristics\u201d, they pledged to be more entrepreneurial in future.\n\nThe executives pledged to balance continued share buybacks with investing for the future. They said $12.5bn had been spent repurchasing shares, cutting total share count by 5 per cent, during the year to March 31, while they had also paid a $2.5bn dividend to shareholders.\n\nBut analysts said Alibaba\u2019s move to issue convertible debt had perplexed some investors.\n\n\u201cBasically they are issuing equity at a high price in the future to immediately buy back their shares at a cheaper price,\u201d said John Choi of Daiwa Capital Markets. \u201cOn the one hand, investors understand it, on the other hand, it\u2019s unsettling.\u201d\n\nA securities researcher added that the market perceived Alibaba to be issuing equity at the end of the day, which was behind the near 8-per cent stock price decline in recent days.\n\n\u201cAlibaba has a tonne of USD on their balance sheet, but they seem to see their investors as an ATM,\u201d the researcher said, asking not to be named. Alibaba reported holding 30bn in dollars and 381bn in renminbi ($52.6bn) on its balance sheet at March 31.\n\nStory continues FILE - The logo of Chinese technology firm Alibaba is seen at its office in Beijing on Aug. 10, 2021. Alibaba Group Holding on Tuesday said it had scrapped plans to list its logistics unit Cainiao in Hong Kong, as it looks to prioritize growing its e-commerce business while facing challenging IPO market conditions. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\u201cThe bigger implication here is the billions of dollars of cash Chinese companies have on their balance sheet may not be as easily accessible as you would think,\u201d they added.\n\nAnalysts said Alibaba was probably financing the share repurchases because of the difficulty of getting cash out of mainland China, a perennial challenge for Chinese and foreign groups.\n\nThe difficulties could be greater at present as the People\u2019s Bank of China battles to forestall downward pressure on the renminbi.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s chief financial officer Toby Xu said in February that the company had a \u201ccertain percentage\u201d of cash sitting offshore, but that the amount of the buybacks would also be affected by its ability to move its generated cash offshore.\n\nA person familiar with the convertible debt deal said it was overall a cheaper way to raise dollars offshore than issuing a straight bond.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2023\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Financial Times Ltd.

Alibaba\u2019s ADRs closed at $80.80 Thursday.\n\nAlibaba didn\u2019t outline the scope of the share repurchase in its statement, but the person familiar with the situation said that Alibaba will buy back 14.8 million ADRs, or about $1.2 billion worth of shares, concurrent to the offering.\n\nCitigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc helped arrange the deal, according to terms seen earlier by Bloomberg News.\n\n(Updates with coupon rate in second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019 Google\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade How the $17 Desk Salad Won\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alibaba Group Prices US$4,500 Million Offering of Convertible Senior Notes",
        "content": "HANGZHOU, China, May 24, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988 (HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), \"Alibaba,\" \"Alibaba Group\" or the \"Company\") today announced the pricing of its private offering of US$4,500 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the \"Notes\") to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (the \"Notes Offering\"). The Company also granted the initial purchasers in the Notes Offering an option to purchase up to an additional US$500 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, exercisable for settlement within a 13-day period, beginning on, and including, the first date on which the Notes are issued. The Notes Offering is expected to close on May 29, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nAlibaba Group estimates that the net proceeds from the Notes Offering will be approximately US$4,436 million (or US$4,930 million if the initial purchasers\u2019 option is exercised in full), after deducting the initial purchasers\u2019 discounts and estimated expenses payable by the Company.\n\nAlibaba Group intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to (i) repurchase approximately 14.8 million of its American depositary shares (\"ADSs\"), each currently representing eight ordinary shares, pursuant to its existing share repurchase program, concurrently with the pricing of the Notes Offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates, as its agent, at a price per ADS equal to US$80.80, the last reported sale price per ADS on the NYSE on May 23, 2024 (the \"Concurrent Repurchase\"); (ii) fund further share repurchases, from time to time, under the Company\u2019s existing share repurchase program; and (iii) fund the US$573.75 million cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below.\n\nWhen issued, the Notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of Alibaba Group. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2031, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year, payable in arrears on June 1 and December 1, of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHolders may convert all or any portion of the Notes, in integral multiples of US$1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the third trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, ADSs, or a combination of cash and ADSs, at its election. Holders may also elect to receive ordinary shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion. Holders who hold the Notes in global form and wish to elect to receive ordinary shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion are advised that such election is not exercisable through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, and such holders are advised to apprise themselves in advance of the requisite procedures to exercise such election and the timing thereof.\n\nThe initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 9.5202 ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately US$105.04 per ADS. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30% over the last reported sale price of $80.80 per ADS on the NYSE on May 23, 2024. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or following our delivery of a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event or such notice of redemption, as the case may be, as further described below.\n\nThe Company may redeem for cash all but not part of the Notes in the event of certain tax law changes (the \"Tax Redemption\"). The Company may also redeem for cash all but not part of the Notes at any time if less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued remains outstanding at such time (the \"Cleanup Redemption\"). The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to June 8, 2029, except in connection with a Tax Redemption or a Cleanup Redemption. On or after June 8, 2029, the Company may also redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the last reported sale price of the ADSs has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect on (i) each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately prior to the date the Company provides notice of redemption and (ii) the trading day immediately preceding the date the Company sends such notice (such redemption, an \"Optional Redemption\"). The redemption price in the case of a Tax Redemption, a Cleanup Redemption or an Optional Redemption will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the related redemption date.\n\nHolders have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Notes on June 1, 2029. In addition, holders of the Notes have the option, subject to certain conditions, to require the Company to repurchase any Notes held in the event of a \"fundamental change\" (as will be defined in the indenture for the Notes). The repurchase price, in each case, will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date.\n\nCapped Call Transactions\n\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company has entered into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the \"Option Counterparties\"). The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the ADSs and the ordinary shares of the Company represented thereby upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments that the Company will be then required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap that will initially be $161.6000, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of $80.80 per ADS on the NYSE on May 23, 2024, and is subject to certain customary adjustments, and subject to the Company\u2019s ability to elect, subject to certain conditions, to settle the capped call transactions in cash, in whole or in part (in which case the Company would not receive any ADSs from the Option Counterparties to the extent of the cash settlement of the capped call transactions). If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional Notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the Option Counterparties and the remainder to fund further share repurchases, from time to time, under the Company\u2019s existing share repurchase program.\n\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase the ADSs and/or ordinary shares and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the ADSs and/or ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the ADSs and/or ordinary shares, other securities of the Company or the price of the Notes at that time. The effect, if any, of this activity, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of the ADSs and/or ordinary shares or the price of the Notes will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time.\n\nIn addition, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the ADSs, ordinary shares, the Notes or other securities of the Company and/or purchasing or selling the ADSs, the ordinary shares, the Notes or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes, repurchase of the Notes by the Company on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise, in each case, if the Company opts to unwind the relevant portion of the capped call transactions early). The effect, if any, of this activity on the market price of the ADSs and/or the ordinary shares, or the price of the Notes will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of this activity could, however, also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the ADSs and/or the ordinary shares, other securities of the Company or the price of the Notes, which could affect whether the holders convert the Notes and value of the consideration that the holders will receive upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, any of the Option Counterparties may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions and activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within the Company\u2019s control.\n\nConcurrent and Future Repurchases\n\nThe Concurrent Repurchase is expected to facilitate the initial hedges by investors who desire to hedge their investments in the Notes, as the Company intends to repurchase the entire expected initial delta of the transaction, after taking into account purchases made by Option Counterparties in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions. In addition to the Concurrent Repurchase, the Company may also repurchase additional ADSs and/or ordinary shares on the open market after the pricing of the Notes and from time to time. The Concurrent Repurchase and future repurchases pursuant to the Company\u2019s share repurchase program will be funded by the net proceeds of the Notes Offering and other cash on hand. Our repurchase activities, whether concurrent with the pricing of the Notes or otherwise pursuant to our existing share repurchase program, could increase, or reduce the magnitude of any decrease in, the market price of the ADSs and/or ordinary shares and/or the price of the Notes.\n\nThe Notes, the ADSs deliverable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, and the ordinary shares represented thereby or deliverable upon conversion of the Notes in lieu thereof, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and are being offered and sold in the United States only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\n\nThis press release contains information about the pending Notes Offering, and there can be no assurance that the Notes Offering and/or the Company\u2019s share repurchase program (or any portion thereof) will be completed.\n\nAbout Alibaba Group\n\nAlibaba Group\u2019s mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. The Company aims to build the future infrastructure of commerce. It envisions that its customers will meet, work and live at Alibaba, and that it will be a good company that lasts for 102 years.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks sank on Friday, tracking weakness in Wall Street as increasing anxiety over sticky U.S. inflation and high interest rates battered sentiment towards risk-driven assets.\n\nChinese markets extended losses after clocking steep declines on Thursday, as a brewing trade war with the U.S. and military drills near Taiwan kept investors on edge.\n\nU.S. stock index futures steadied in Asian trade, after Wall Street indexes fell sharply on Thursday following a string of warnings on inflation and interest rates from Federal Reserve officials.\n\nA rally in market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- on stellar first-quarter earnings- helped limit bigger losses in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. But this rally did not spill over into Asia, with regional chipmakers facing their own headwinds.\n\nChinese markets fall further, Hong Kong walloped by tech rout\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, extending sharp declines from the prior session.\n\nChina was hit with a wave of negative sentiment this week as a trade war with the U.S. appeared to have escalated. The People\u2019s Liberation Army was also seen conducting military drills near Taiwan, pointing to worsening tensions in the region.\n\nBut Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index saw outsized losses, hit by an extended rout in heavyweight technology stocks. The index slid 1.5% on Friday, adding to a 1.7% drop on Thursday.\n\nAlibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) (HK:9988) fell another 1% following a 5.2% tumble in the prior session, after it said it was issuing $5 billion in convertible bonds to spur growth.\n\nLosses in the tech giant dragged its peers Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) lower, while investors collected profits in property stocks in anticipation of more insight into Beijing\u2019s stimulus measures.\n\nAsian stocks fall as markets price out US rate cuts\n\nBroader Asian markets fell on Friday, extending losses from the prior session as a slew of hawkish signals from the Fed- particularly warnings on sticky inflation and unchanging interest rates- saw investors largely price out expectations for interest rate cuts this year.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 shed 1.1%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX lost 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively.\n\nSentiment towards Japan was also hit by data showing consumer inflation softened as expected in April, reflecting persistent weakness in spending.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open, with the index set for profit-taking after clocking record highs on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsung sinks on HBM woes, dragging KOSPI lower\n\nSamsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) over 2% on Friday after Reuters reported that the memory chip making giant\u2019s high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips were still not meeting Nvidia\u2019s standards, due to heating and power issues.\n\nThe report highlighted potential issues with the firm\u2019s ambitions to gain a foothold in advanced HBM chips- demand for which is set to grow exponentially on the back of artificial intelligence.\n\nLosses in Samsung dragged South Korea\u2019s KOSPI index over 1% lower. Samsung\u2019s peer SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which supplies HBM chips to Nvidia, fell slightly.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks hit by rate jitters, China extends losses\n\nNCAA agrees to 'road map' settlement for college athlete payments\n\nSamsung sinks as report shows more work needed on HBM chips for Nvidia\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Smart Money Clues: Buy these 5 Stocks",
        "content": "Preview: Today, we will discuss the catalysts and the \u201csmart money\u201d buying the MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT), Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM), iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), Alibaba (BABA), and JD.com (JD).\n\nFollow the Smart Money\n\nOn Wall Street, a plethora of distractions exist. There are the talking heads on financial television, news items flashing across trading platforms, and an investor\u2019s own psychology to contend with. For these reasons, investors should develop their own system, optimize the system, and look to block out as much noise as possible. That said, there is no need to completely \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d either. Investors can gain valuable insights from insiders and the world\u2019s most profitable traders to gain even further conviction. Below are two ways to follow the \u201csmart money.\u201d\n\n1) Watch 13F Filings\n\nA 13F filing is a quarterly report that institutional money managers with $100 million in assets under management (AUM) must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within 15 days of the end of the quarter. \u00a0Though everyday investors won\u2019t get to buy at the exact time the smart money does, they can gain a valuable look into the reasoning behind these trades and understand the investor\u2019s conviction based on how large a portion of the portfolio it takes up.\n\n2) Look at Insider Buys\n\nInvestors can also gain an edge by watching for insider buying. However, investors need to understand that insider buying tends to have a more significant weight than insider selling, all else equal. That\u2019s because insider selling is often planned or scheduled in advance, while insiders only buy for one reason \u2013 they believe the stock will go up.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller: Argentina & U.S. Small Caps\n\nGeorge Soros prodigy Stanley Druckenmiller is best known for his thirty-year track record as an institutional investor in which he never lost money in a calendar year. Druckenmiller\u2019s consistency, ability to anticipate, and knowledge across asset classes separate him from almost any investor. The seasoned veteran is coming off one of his best quarterly performances ever after catching the move in chip leader Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nArgentina Thesis: A New Free Market Government\n\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Druckenmiller revealed that he was inspired to invest in Argentina after witnessing new Argentine President Javier Milei speak on TV about his free-market policy ideas at the Davos conference. Druckenmiller revealed that he used AI to look for the top five Argentine ADRs and immediately invested in them. Druckenmiller is betting that after years of socialism, free market policies will drive Argentinian stocks higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nARGT ETF: Strength Begets Strength\n\nThe ARGT ETF offers a basket of Argentine stocks for U.S. retail investors and a way to piggyback on Druckenmiller\u2019s thesis. ARGT is exhibiting relative strength versus the rest of the world, gaining some 23% year-to-date.\n\nSmall Caps: Reversion to the Mean?\n\nDruckenmiller\u2019s new largest position is a call options play in the Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM).\n\nCatalyst: Lower Interest Rates\n\nHigher interest rates have acted as the proverbial \u201cpebble in the shoe\u201d for small-cap investors. However, the odds of interest rate cuts late in 2024 have recently increased as inflation numbers have cooled. After underperforming for years, do small caps finally revert to the mean? The chart suggests that the answer is yes. IWM is knocking on the door of a singifcant technical breakout. As the old Wall Street adage goes, \u201cThe longer the base, the higher in space.\u201d Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs Spark Institutional Adoption\n\nEarly this year, the landmark approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs sparked hope that big institutions would begin to adopt the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. After the recent batch of 13F disclosures came through, the result of the BTC ETFs is clear. More than 600 institutions disclosed positions in Bitcoin ETFs, such as IBIT (which we own). Meanwhile, Bitcoin stands to benefit from several tailwinds, such as the \u201chalving.\u201d\n\nMichael Burry & David Tepper: Bold and Often Correct\n\nMichael Burry and David Tepper are best known for their large contrarian bets, which are often proven correct. Burry rose to fame after correctly predicting and shorting the market during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Christian Bale played him in the movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d After the smoke cleared from the GFC, David Tepper made monster investments in banks like Bank of America (BAC), betting the government would deem them \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d (he was correct). Tepper ended up making billions and enough to buy the Carolina Panthers.\n\nChina and Alibaba (BABA): A Contrarian Bet\n\nBurry and Tepper are betting on a turnaround in China, specifically in the e-commerce space. Burry\u2019s largest position is JD.com (JD) and his second-largest is Alibaba (BABA). Tepper\u2019s largest open position is BABA. BABA, in particular, is interesting because insiders like Founder and CEO Jack Ma have purchased more than $100 million in BABA stock. Meanwhile, the company has a bargain basement valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis quarter\u2019s 13Fs and insider buys offer vital clues about what the smart money is betting on. Argentina, small caps, Bitcoin, and China are essential market areas to track.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alibaba Group Announces Proposed Offering of Convertible Senior Notes",
        "content": "HANGZHOU, China, May 23, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988 (HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), \"Alibaba,\" \"Alibaba Group\" or the \"Company\") today announced a proposed offering (the \"Notes Offering\"), subject to market and other conditions, of US$4,500 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the \"Notes\") in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company expects to grant the initial purchasers in the Notes Offering an option to purchase up to an additional US$500 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, exercisable for settlement within a 13-day period, beginning on, and including, the first date on which the Notes are issued.\n\nAlibaba Group intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to (i) repurchase a number of its American depositary shares (\"ADSs\"), each currently representing eight ordinary shares pursuant to its existing share repurchase program, concurrently with the pricing of the Notes Offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates, as its agent, as described below (the \"Concurrent Repurchase\"); (ii) fund further share repurchases, from time to time, under the Company\u2019s existing share repurchase program; and (iii) fund the costs of entering into the capped call transactions described below.\n\nWhen issued, the Notes will be general senior unsecured obligations of Alibaba Group. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2031, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.\n\nHolders may convert all or any portion of the Notes, in integral multiples of US$1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the third trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, ADSs, or a combination of cash and ADSs, at its election. Holders may also elect to receive ordinary shares in lieu of any ADSs deliverable upon conversion. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the Notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the Notes.\n\nCapped Call Transactions\n\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company expects to enter into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the \"Option Counterparties\"). The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the ADSs and the ordinary shares of the Company represented thereby upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments that the Company will be then required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap expected to be 100% over the last reported sale price of the ADSs on the day the Notes Offering is priced, and subject to the Company\u2019s ability to elect, subject to certain conditions, to settle the capped call transactions in cash, in whole or in part (in which case the Company would not receive any ADSs from the Option Counterparties to the extent of the cash settlement of the capped call transactions). If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional Notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the Option Counterparties and the remainder to fund further share repurchases, from time to time, under the Company\u2019s existing share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase the ADSs and/or ordinary shares and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the ADSs and/or ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the ADSs and/or ordinary shares, other securities of the Company or the price of the Notes at that time. The effect, if any, of this activity, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of the ADSs and/or ordinary shares or the price of the Notes will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time.\n\nIn addition, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the ADSs, ordinary shares, the Notes or other securities of the Company and/or purchasing or selling the ADSs, the ordinary shares, the Notes or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes, repurchase of the Notes by the Company on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise, in each case, if the Company opts to unwind the relevant portion of the capped call transactions early). The effect, if any, of this activity on the market price of the ADSs and/or the ordinary shares, or the price of the Notes will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of this activity could, however, also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the ADSs and/or the ordinary shares, other securities of the Company or the price of the Notes, which could affect whether the holders convert the Notes and value of the consideration that the holders will receive upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, any of the Option Counterparties may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions and activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within the Company\u2019s control.\n\nConcurrent and Future Repurchases\n\nThe Concurrent Repurchase is expected to facilitate the initial hedges by investors who desire to hedge their investments in the Notes, as the Company intends to repurchase the entire expected initial delta of the transaction, after taking into account purchases made by Option Counterparties in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions. The Company expects the purchase price in the Concurrent Repurchase to be the last reported sale price per ADS on the New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2024. In addition to the Concurrent Repurchase, the Company may also repurchase additional ADSs and/or ordinary shares on the open market after the pricing of the Notes and from time to time. The Concurrent Repurchase and future repurchases pursuant to the Company\u2019s share repurchase program will be funded by the net proceeds of the Notes Offering and other cash on hand, and, in the aggregate, are generally expected to offset potential dilution to the holders of the Company\u2019s ADSs (or ordinary shares) upon conversion of the Notes. Our repurchase activities, whether concurrently with the pricing of the Notes or otherwise pursuant to our existing share repurchase program, could increase, or reduce the magnitude of any decrease in, the market price of the ADSs and/or ordinary shares and/or the price of the Notes.\n\nThe Notes, the ADSs deliverable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, and the ordinary shares represented thereby or deliverable upon conversion of the Notes in lieu thereof, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and are being offered and sold in the United States only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\n\nThis press release contains information about the pending Notes Offering, and there can be no assurance that the Notes Offering and/or the Company\u2019s share repurchase program (or any portion thereof) will be completed.\n\nAbout Alibaba Group\n\nAlibaba Group\u2019s mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. The Company aims to build the future infrastructure of commerce. It envisions that its customers will meet, work and live at Alibaba, and that it will be a good company that lasts for 102 years.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"future,\" \"aim,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"seek,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"ongoing,\" \"target,\" \"guidance,\" \"is/are likely to\" and similar statements. In addition, statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the intended use of proceeds, the terms of the Notes, the anticipated terms of, and the effects of entering into, the capped call transactions and the actions of the Option Counterparties and their respective affiliates and whether the Company will complete the Notes Offering, are or contain forward-looking statements. Alibaba may also make forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in announcements made on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the \"Hong Kong Stock Exchange\"), in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Sold Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia in Q1. But Here Are 3 AI Stocks He Bought Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "David Tepper appears to be firmly on the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon. All of his top-10 holdings have close AI connections.\n\nThe billionaire investor doesn't seem to be as bullish about some of those AI stocks as he once was, though. In the first quarter, Tepper sold shares of Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, and Nvidia. However, he bought these three AI stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Alibaba Group Holding\n\nAlibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA) now ranks as the largest holding in Tepper's Appaloosa Management portfolio. The Chinese tech company leaped past Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia to take the top spot after Tepper increased his stake by nearly 159% in Q1.\n\nTepper's move has already paid off. Alibaba stock fell nearly 7% in the first quarter of 2024. However, it's now up close to 11% year to date after jumping 17% in April and May.\n\nWhy did the billionaire investor decide to significantly boost Appaloosa's position in Alibaba? Valuation was almost certainly a key factor. Alibaba's shares trade at under 10.5 times forward earnings. The stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.82.\n\nTepper also probably likes Alibaba's strategy to return to growth. The company's Q1 results show this strategy is bearing fruit. Revenue jumped 7% year over year in Q1. Alibaba also recently shook up the Chinese AI services market by slashing prices for its AI offerings.\n\n2. Oracle\n\nAppaloosa Management increased its position in Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) by nearly 74% in Q1. This big purchase moved Oracle into the eighth spot in the hedge fund's portfolio.\n\nOracle enjoyed solid momentum throughout most of Q1. The stock is up almost 20% so far this year after rebounding from an April pullback. Even with this nice gain, though, Oracle's forward-earnings multiple is under 20 -- less expensive than most megacap AI stocks.\n\nI suspect Tepper especially finds Oracle's cloud business appealing. The company's cloud revenue soared 25% year over year in its latest quarter to $5.1 billion, representing 38% of total revenue.\n\nAI continues to serve as a major growth driver for Oracle's cloud unit. CEO Safra Catz said in the fiscal Q3 earnings press release that demand for the company's Gen2 AI infrastructure \"substantially exceeds supply -- despite the fact that we are opening new and expanding cloud [data-centers] very, very rapidly.\"\n\n3. PDD Holdings\n\nPDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD) ranks behind Oracle as the ninth-largest holding in Appaloosa Management's portfolio. Tepper bought more than 1.3 million shares of the Chinese tech stock in Q1, increasing his hedge fund's stake by roughly 171%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany American investors might be unfamiliar with PDD. The company operates Pinduoduo, a popular e-commerce platform in China. It also runs Temu, a relatively new online marketplace targeting global markets, including the U.S. Like its American counterpart, Amazon, PDD invests heavily in AI technology.\n\nPDD had a rough Q1 with its shares sinking nearly 25% at one point. However, the stock has bounced back strongly in recent weeks. This rebound was fueled in part by PDD's positive Q1 results. Revenue soared 131% year over year with adjusted earnings more than tripling year over year.\n\nTepper no doubt likes PDD's valuation. Shares trade at 16.4 times forward earnings with a PEG ratio of 0.71. The billionaire could also view PDD's Temu strategy as a great long-term growth driver.\n\nBetter than Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia?\n\nAre Alibaba, Oracle, and PDD better picks than Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia? Tepper seems to think so -- or at least did in Q1. One thing is certain: These three stocks are cheaper than the five Magnificent Seven stocks. That could appeal to other investors with the overall stock market priced at a premium.\n\nI'm somewhat skittish about investing in Alibaba and PDD because of uncertainties about the potential actions of the Chinese government. However, I think all eight stocks should be big winners over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

The aim is to fund share repurchases and growth, the people said.\n\nAn offering could come as soon as this week, though no final decisions have been made, the people said.\n\nA representative for Alibaba didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nAlibaba needs capital to invest in its core businesses of commerce and the cloud, both of which have bled market share during a crackdown on the sector by Chinese authorities and subsequent internal turmoil. The company is leading the way in cutting prices on cloud and artificial intelligence services, while also starting to ramp up bets in AI, a hotbed of global investment activity.\n\nAlibaba approved an expansion of a share buyback program earlier this year, adding $25 billion in stock repurchases \u2014 one of the largest-ever in China.\n\nThe Chinese company\u2019s American depositary receipts have fallen 6.6% in the first three days of this week, trimming their year-to-date gain to 6.7% and leaving Alibaba with a market value of just over $200 billion.\n\nRead More: Jack Ma Buys Alibaba Stock to Show Support for Struggling Empire\n\nAlibaba\u2019s latest quarterly net income tumbled 86% from a year earlier after an unexplained writedown for losses in its publicly traded holdings, which range from AI firm SenseTime Group Inc. to brick-and-mortar chain Sun Art Retail Group Ltd.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding and other e-commerce operators have released encouraging early sales data from their midyear 618 promotions - China's biggest shopping season after Singles' Day, and a bellwether of consumer sentiment in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nFour hours after Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall shopping platforms launched their sales event at 8pm on Monday, 59 brands each saw their gross merchandise value (GMV) - the value of goods sold - surpass 100 million yuan (US$13.8 million), while 376 products saw GMV exceed 10 million yuan, Alibaba's domestic e-commerce unit said on Tuesday.\n\nApple, which is offering a fresh round of steep discounts for its iPhone 15 models in mainland China, sold more than 1.5 billion yuan worth of products on the Alibaba platforms an hour after the event began, outcompeting its Chinese rivals, according to Taobao and Tmall.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAround 370,000 small businesses more than doubled their GMV on the first day of sales from last year, the platforms said. Alibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.\n\nAn advertisement for Alibaba's 618 shopping event. Photo: Bloomberg alt=An advertisement for Alibaba's 618 shopping event. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nThe positive sales figures posted by the e-commerce giant, which last week reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, come despite signs of sluggish consumer spending in China.\n\nNational retail sales, a key gauge of consumption, rose just 2.3 per cent year on year in April, weaker than the 3.1 per cent seen in March and 5.5 per cent in the combined period of January and February.\n\nStill, global investment banks and brokers have dialled down their scepticism about China's growth prospects in recent months. The e-commerce market, in particular, has the potential to further expand in the coming years even if the country's offline retail activity remains tepid, a senior JPMorgan analyst told the Post last week.\n\nAfter a relatively quiet 618 event last year, when major e-commerce players withheld GMV numbers amid a challenging economy, companies are pulling out all the stops this year to attract shoppers.\n\nTech giants Alibaba and JD.com, as well as smaller players like Kuaishou, have skipped the presales period this time around, which in previous years allowed consumers to make a deposit on goods they wanted to buy to guarantee a low price during the actual sales period.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, platforms are already showering shoppers with steep discounts in the weeks leading up to June 18, the big sales day that gives the shopping event its name.\n\nXiaohongshu, an Instagram-like social media platform in China that began its second-ever 618 shopping festival on Tuesday, said it saw GMV from its live-streaming sessions surge six-fold on the first day compared to last year, while the number of orders jumped more than eight-fold.\n\nThe platform, also known as Little Red Book and allows users to post content related to topics such as fashion and travel, is betting on live-streaming by merchants and online influencers to gain a foothold in the Chinese e-commerce market.\n\nPinduoduo, the bargain e-commerce platform run by PDD Holdings, kicked off its 618 sales on Sunday, but has yet to release any sales figures. JD.com is set to begin sales on May 31.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "The race to lead China\u2019s AI sector heats up as ByteDance, Alibaba and Baidu offer their models at rock-bottom prices",
        "content": "China's biggest companies have a go-to tactic when it comes to fighting off the competition: Cut prices, and cut them drastically. Multiple sectors of the Chinese consumer economy\u2014e-commerce, consumer devices, or electric vehicles\u2014are now locked in a fierce price war.\n\nThe AI sector is the latest industry to get hit with deep discounts, with the country's biggest tech companies almost giving away access to their models to win over customers.\n\nThere are over 200 large language models (LLMs) in China, according to the state-run Global Times,citing China Media Group. Yet the most prominent of these are those from China's big tech players like Alibaba, Baidu, and TikTok owner ByteDance. LLMs underpin many generative AI services, like OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nLast week, ByteDance revealed pricing for its Doubao LLM. The TikTok-owner will charge 0.0008 yuan ($0.0001) per 1,000 tokens for its top-of-the-line Doubao Pro, a level that ByteDance claimed was 99% lower than the industry average for enterprise users.\n\nA token is a unit of data processed by an LLM. For OpenAI's ChatGPT, 1000 tokens is equal to about 750 English words.\n\nByteDance's competitors were quick to respond. On Tuesday, Alibaba cut prices by up to 97% for some of its Qwen LLM models. Hours later, Baidu said its Ernie Speed and Ernie Light, two lighter versions of its Ernie LLM, would be free for all business users.\n\nOn Wednesday, iFlytek\u2014which has its own AI chatbot \"Spark\"\u2014also slashed prices for its services. Charging just 0.21 yuan ($0.03) for 10,000 of its input tokens, equivalent to generating about 15,000 Chinese characters on its platform.\n\nChinese AI services are already priced lower than their Western counterparts. OpenAI charges its users $20 per month for a ChatGPT Plus subscription, though the chatbot is not available in China. By comparison, Baidu charges 59.90 yuan ($8.32) a month for its top-end Ernie Bot 4.0, which CEO Robin Li claims performs as well as OpenAI's product.\n\nChina's AI sector is still in its early development, with popularity shifting quickly between different providers. ByteDance's Doubao chatbot, released last August, has already overtaken first-mover Baidu's Ernie bot in regular monthly users on iOS, according to Bloomberg citing data from Sensor Tower.\n\nPrice wars in China\n\nDeep discounts are common in China, where companies often slash prices to grab market share from competitors.\n\nAlibaba and its fellow tech companies Tencent and JD are engaged in a separate price war in the cloud computing space. The three firms has sharply reduced fees for their services to fend off competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust earlier this week, Apple cut prices for its iPhones in China for the second time this year, as it tries to defend its position from Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Honor.\n\nBut perhaps the fiercest competition is in the EV sector. Chinese carmakers, as well as U.S.-headquartered Tesla have been locked in an extended price war since Tesla first started slashing prices October 2022, slashing prices to gain market share as China's EV sales start to slow down.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

These discussions have raised\u00a0concerns\u00a0given Taiwan\u2019s critical role in global semiconductor production,\n\nAlso Read: Pay More for Chips Made Outside Taiwan as AI Demand Soars and Global Expansion Continues: Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nDuring a meeting with the Dutch government, ASML confirmed its ability to deactivate these machines remotely despite the threat. The Netherlands has conducted invasion simulations to better evaluate the risks.\n\nThis remote shutdown capability is specific to ASML\u2019s line of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. It is crucial for producing the smallest and most advanced microchip transistors, with TSMC being the primary client.\n\nThese EUVs, essential for AI and sensitive military technologies, are the only ones of their kind and are produced exclusively by ASML in Veldhoven.\n\nASML\u2019s EUV machines, each costing over 200 million euros, are tightly regulated. Influenced by U.S. pressures, the Dutch government restricts ASML from selling these machines to China due to the potential advantages it could give in the global semiconductor competition.\n\nU.S. influence has also led to the Dutch government\u2019s recent actions to stop exports of ASML\u2019s highly sophisticated chipmaking machines to China.\n\nBefore this, U.S. officials had already influenced ASML to cancel certain deliveries to Chinese firms.\n\nASML anticipates that the latest export-control measures will impact up to 15% of its sales to China this year.\n\nPrior reports indicated Huawei Technologies Co\u2019s self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) patent bypassed the need for ASML\u2019s EUV machines, which\u00a0are\u00a0restricted\u00a0by\u00a0U.S.\u00a0embargo.\n\nIn November, Huawei outbid\u00a0Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) for a significant artificial intelligence chip order from Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) as U.S. sanctions took effect.\n\nSimultaneously,\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese companies reportedly planned substantial cuts in their Nvidia chip orders. Chinese cloud companies expect to reduce their orders for high-end AI chips from Nvidia.\n\nDespite a 5.5% decrease in overall imports in 2023, China\u2019s imports of chipmaking machines surged by 14% to nearly $40 billion, the highest since 2015. This spike included a notable increase in imports from the Netherlands, driven by anticipation of stricter export controls.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: ASML shares traded lower by 1.21% at $928.04 premarket\u00a0at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced\u00a0with the help of\u00a0AI tools and\u00a0was\u00a0reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via ASML\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report ASML HOLDING (ASML): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article ASML and Taiwan Semi Prep for Potential China-Taiwan Conflict with Remote Shutdown Feature originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Its shares have gained 13.9% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s return of 11.2%.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Taobao and Tmall Group segment increased 4% year over year to RMB 93.22 billion ($12.9 billion), which accounted for 42% of the total revenues.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the collaborations are expected to aid the company in capitalizing on the growth opportunities present in the China e-commerce market. Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the China e-commerce market is expected to register a CAGR of 11.3% between 2024 and 2029.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects of Alibaba in the promising China e-commerce market will likely strengthen the company\u2019s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $137.97 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 5.7%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.26 per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.2%.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Taobao and Tmall Group segment is continuously experiencing sluggish growth due to continued macroeconomic uncertainties and weakening market conditions in China, which remains a major headwind for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntensifying Competition in China\n\nAlibaba faces stiff competition against some notable industry players like JD.com JD and PDD Holdings PDD in the China e-commerce space, which remains a concern for the company.\r\n\r\nJD.com recently launched the \"Trade-in Alliance for Household Appliances and Home Goods\" in collaboration with over 100 brands in a bid to expand trade-in services across China. It also unveiled a \"Three Free & Four Unlimited\" trade-in service, providing door-to-door pickup, disassembly and handling of old goods with no restrictions on items, and offers discounts with just four clicks.\r\n\r\nThe company also plans to invest more than one billion yuan in cash incentives and traffic resources to support merchants' growth and innovation. The company will integrate AI-driven solutions into merchant operations, including ChatRhino, an AI-powered platform.\r\n\r\nPDD Holdings, on the other hand, is gaining solid customer momentum in the China e-commerce space with its platforms Pinduoduo and Temu.\r\n\r\nEarlier, PDD\u2019s Flash sale channel initiative during Singles Day enhanced customer traction on its platform, thereby acting as a growth engine for over 100,000 SME merchants by doubling their sales in over 40 product categories, including agricultural products, national branded products and quality imported goods.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the same sector is The Gap GPS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "content": "By Liam Mo and Eduardo Baptista\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu slashed prices on Tuesday of large-language models (LLMs) used to power generative artificial intelligence products, as a price war in the cloud computing sector heats up in China.\n\nAlibaba's cloud unit announced price cuts of up to 97% on a range of its Tongyi Qwen LLMs. Its Qwen-Long model, for instance, will cost only 0.0005 yuan per 1,000 tokens - or units of data processed by the LLM - after the price cut, down from 0.02 yuan per 1,000 tokens.\n\nIt was quickly followed by Baidu, which hours later announced that its Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite models would be free for all business users.\n\nA price war in China's cloud computing space has been ongoing for the past few months, with Alibaba and Tencent recently lowering prices of their cloud computing services.\n\nMany Chinese cloud vendors have relied on AI chatbot services to boost sales, after China saw a wave of investment in large language models in response to the hit debut of U.S.-based OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nThe price war in China's cloud computing space has now hit the large-language models that power these chatbots, threatening to lower companies' profit margins.\n\nBaidu's Ernie Lite and Ernie Speed were released in March and until Tuesday corporate customers paid to use them.\n\nBytedance announced last week that the main model of its Doubao LLMs would be priced 99.3% lower than the industry average for business users.\n\nChinese LLM developers have focused on charging businesses as a way to monetize their investments in LLMs.\n\nSome have also begun targeting individual users. Chinese startup Moonshot recently launched a tipping feature, where business and individual users can pay to prioritize their use of its chatbot services.\n\nBaidu was the first company in China to offer its LLM products to paying consumers, charging 59 yuan per month for those looking to use its most advanced Ernie 4 model.\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Eduardo Baptista; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, China's biggest cloud computing service provider, slashed the fees for using its generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by up to 97 per cent, a salvo in a price war that comes a week after ByteDance launched a rival service that costs less than most competitors.\n\nThe price cuts apply to nine of Alibaba's Qwen self-developed large language models (LLMs), also known as Tongyi Qianwen, said Liu Weiguang, president of public cloud business, at the firm's AI summit in Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province, on Tuesday.\n\n\"Today, we have lowered the threshold for enterprises to use LLMs better and faster, and for industries to create LLM-powered applications in the real world,\" Liu said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe discounts offered by Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, come as Big Tech companies on the mainland race to draw users to their respective LLMs, the technology that underpins ChatGPT and other generative AI services. More than 200 LLMs have been introduced in China, according to government estimates.\n\nTongyi Qianwen, also known as Qwen, is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Tongyi Qianwen, also known as Qwen, is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nHours after Alibaba Cloud's announcement, web search giant Baidu said its Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite LLMs, both launched earlier this year, are available free of charge with immediate effect.\n\nThe Beijing-based firm, which in November began charging 59.9 yuan a month for the use of its top-end Ernie Bot 4.0, is working to make its AI services more affordable, founder and chairman Robin Li Yanhong said in an earnings report last week.\n\nThat came a day after TikTok owner ByteDance introduced its self-developed Doubao LLM series, pricing its top-of-the-line model as low as 0.0008 yuan (US$0.0001) per 1,000-token prompt. In AI, a token is a fundamental unit of data that is processed by algorithms, with 1,000 tokens roughly equivalent to 750 English words.\n\nFor comparison, Alibaba Cloud's Qwen-max, the series' most powerful commercial model said to be capable of performance equivalent to OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, now costs 0.04 yuan per 1,000 input tokens after a 67 per cent discount.\n\nFees for Qwen-long, a commercial model designed to process long text, have been reduced by 97 per cent to 0.0005 yuan per 1,000 input tokens.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also giving out 4 million free tokens per model for each new user until June 21, while offering a seven-day free trial for its open-source Qwen 1.5-110B and Qwen 1.5-32B.\n\nAlibaba said earlier this month that its LLMs have been adopted by more than 90,000 corporate clients, including smartphone giant Xiaomi, a month after Baidu's Li said Ernie Bot had been used by 85,000 corporate clients.\n\nThe aggressive pricing tactics and expansive user bases of Chinese tech giants add pressure on top domestic AI start-ups trying to monetise their models. Zhipu AI currently charges 0.1 yuan per 1,000 tokens for its most capable GLM-4 LLM, while MiniMax's Abab 6.5 and Baichuan's Baichuan2-Turbo cost 0.03 yuan and 0.008 yuan respectively.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. slashed prices for a clutch of artificial intelligence services by as much as 97%, spurring an immediate response from Baidu Inc. in potentially the start of a price war in China\u2019s nascent AI market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Iran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is \u2018Well on the Way\u2019 One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks Florida\u2019s 125% Surge in Property-Insurance Bills Sows Havoc\n\nBaidu Cloud said it would offer free services based on its Ernie AI models on Tuesday, hours after Alibaba offered deals on nine products built atop its own Tongyi Qianwen. ByteDance Ltd. last week announced pricing for AI services that it said were 99% lower than Chinese industry norms, using Ernie and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen as benchmarks.\n\nThe tit-for-tat maneuvers mark the opening salvos of a price-based battle within AI, a field that\u2019s attracting billions of dollars of investment from startups and internet leaders including Tencent Holdings Ltd. The flurry of investment has created scores of AI models and spawned many more consumer and enterprise products in turn, all fighting for the critical mass of users needed to speed AI development.\n\nChina\u2019s tech companies have for years relied heavily on discounts across markets from e-commerce to food delivery and ride-hailing. Alibaba this year spurred a cascade of price reductions in cloud computing, after it offered discounts as much as 55% on more than 100 domestic services in March. That was followed that same day by rounds of discounts from rival JD.com Inc.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nAlibaba\u2019s decision to cut pricing on its Large Language Models (LLM) by up to 97% will likely further disrupt China\u2019s AI market, pushing the sector into a price war. The move is probably in response to ByteDance\u2019s recently launched Doubao LLMs, which were priced at a deep discount to the market. We expect Baidu, Tencent and JD.com to respond in due course.\n\n- Robert Lea, BI analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nShares in Alibaba slid 1% while Baidu dived close to 4% in Hong Kong.\n\nChinese tech pioneers have joined Silicon Valley peers like Microsoft Corp. in placing big bets on generative AI. Beside developing their own in-house foundation models, they\u2019re pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into up-and-coming outfits like Baichuan and Zhipu AI.\n\nAlibaba has gone through a year of tumultuous restructuring to try and claw back users for its cloud business, which also hosts its main AI effort. It stunned investors by calling off a planned spinoff of the arm into an independent, publicly traded unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company \u2014 now under the helm of Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu \u2014 has focused on growing its public cloud, the domestic services arm aimed at enterprise customers. It\u2019s gone through a major revamp to stem market share losses to traditional rivals like Baidu and Tencent as well as state-backed entrants and relative newcomers like Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nRead more: TikTok Parent ByteDance Now Has China\u2019s Most Popular AI Chatbot\n\n--With assistance from Gao Yuan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell slightly on Tuesday as a stimulus-driven rally in Chinese markets ran dry, while concerns over high for longer interest rates also chipped away at sentiment.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was the worst performer for the day, battered by a rout in electric vehicle and technology stocks.\n\nBroader regional technology stocks also stalled as investors grew uncertain ahead of closely-watched earnings from artificial intelligence darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), due this Wednesday.\n\nWall Street indexes provided middling cues to Asian markets, after logging a mixed close on Monday. While strength in tech drove the NASDAQ Composite to record highs, most other sectors lagged amid persistent uncertainty over interest rates. U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in Asian trade.\n\nChina rally stalls, more stimulus cues awaited\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, retreating from their highest levels seen in 2024 so far.\n\nLocal markets were subject to some profit-taking after a stellar rebound over the past two months.\n\nBut markets were also waiting to see how Beijing would roll out its latest list of stimulus measures, and their potential effects on the economy. While optimism over more stimulus was a key driver of China\u2019s recent stock rally, markets were now waiting to see just how much the measures would support the economy.\n\nAnalysts said the rollout of China\u2019s stimulus packages will be the key to an economic recovery, particularly the ones aimed at the beleaguered property market.\n\nHong Kong stocks slide on EV, tech losses\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was the worst performer in Asia on Tuesday, sliding as much as 2% from a nine-month high.\n\nThe outsized loss was driven chiefly by a nearly 20% slump in shares of Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) Inc (HK:2015), after the electric vehicle maker clocked disappointing first quarter earnings. Losses in Li spilled over into other EV stocks, with BYD (SZ:002594) Co Ltd (HK:1211) and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) down over 3% each.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s biggest tech stocks also fell for idiosyncratic reasons. Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) slid 3% after its hotly anticipated Dungeon&Fighter mobile game was taken offline just an hour after its launch.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) fell 1% after its cloud unit further slashed prices, specifically for the firm\u2019s Tongyi Qianwen AI bot.\n\nBaidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) sank 3%, tracking losses in its peers.\n\nBroader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range, as investors awaited more cues on U.S. interest rates this week. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%, while the broader TOPIX index rose 0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.3% after the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s May meeting showed the bank did consider raising interest rates to combat sticky inflation.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI fell 0.5%, while futures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks retreat as China rally cools, Hong Kong slammed by tech rout\n\nStar shares plunge as investors doubt validity of takeover bid by Hard Rock\n\nAustralia, New Zealand send evacuation flights to New Caledonia\n\nView comments",

        "content": "As inflation remains increasingly sticky, finding undervalued stocks to buy has become increasingly difficult. Meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) continue climbing despite rapidly approaching market saturation, which could leave retail traders holding the bag when the music stops.\n\nEven if inflation cools consistently, goods and services remain significantly higher than two years ago. This discrepancy arises because inflation measures ongoing price growth rather than actual price levels, resulting in persistently low consumer confidence despite inflation rate trends. So, we\u2019re looking at a spiraling situation in which companies pull profit from higher pricing rather than internal optimization, which seems destined for correction.\n\nThe bottom line is that meme stocks are back on the menu, and tech stocks are becoming prohibitively expensive for the average retail investor. Both conditions make undervalued stocks an attractive option in today\u2019s market. Affordably priced, these stocks offer an opportunity for investors to accumulate shares at reasonable prices. These undervalued stocks to buy are poised for rapid growth due to favorable circumstances and bullish momentum, laying the groundwork for their future success.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) saw a per-share pricing dip in recent weeks, but it\u2019s tough to discern why. The losses appear to result from general inattention and cooling sentiment after a stellar earnings report initially sent shares soaring. Although this might not represent a true dip, the stock is down enough to be worth buying before the next potential surge.\n\nThat upward movement could happen sooner than expected, given some unusual options activity suggesting hefty expectations for the stock within the next month. While options flow isn\u2019t always definitive, a purchase order for 17,000 call options expiring on May 17th with a price target of $26.50 is certainly notable.\n\nHistorically, Palantir\u2019s stock has traded within a tight range before surging and settling at or near a new floor. For a long time, that floor hovered around $15. Strong earnings pushed the per-share price to $25 before it settled into today\u2019s lower limit of approximately $20. If the company\u2019s earnings trajectory continues, this may be one of the last opportunities to buy Palantir at its relatively undervalued pricing.\n\nTitan Machinery (TITN) Image of the foundation and frame of a house\n\nSmall-cap agriculture and construction equipment value stocks like Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) might not enjoy the same level of recognition as larger counterparts like Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), but Titan\u2019s robust fundamentals speak volumes. Titan Machinery recently released its fourth-quarter and year-end reports, surpassing expectations with a 25% annual sales increase and nearly a 10% rise in yearly earnings despite rising supply chain and fuel costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these strong fundamentals, Titan Machinery is undeniably undervalued, trading at just 0.19x sales, 4.8x earnings and 0.80x book value. This undervaluation is particularly stark given the company\u2019s 79% income growth over three years. With a conservative outlook for 2025, projecting single-digit gains across its segments and a slight dip in year-end earnings, surpassing these modest forecasts could lead to a surge in Titan\u2019s stock value. At current prices, this small-cap value stock is an easy buy.\n\nCricut (CRCT) Image of a person doing crafts on a table.\n\nSource: CRAFT24/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe do-it-yourself set may love Cricut (NASDAQ:CRCT), but the undervalued stock doesn\u2019t get nearly the investor attention it deserves. Although revenue dipped slightly in its most recent earnings report, net income climbed 116% year-over-year, boosted by a 54.7% gross margin expansion. Cricut benefits from improving consumer sentiment, especially as buyers look for stay-at-home activities to save money and manage household budgets.\n\nIn 2024\u2019s first quarter, overall sales dropped 8%, offset by higher paid subscriber rates and increased machine sales. This means more people kickstarted their Cricut journey in recent months, and investors can expect a corresponding sales boost as new users restock and replenish crafting supplies.\n\nNow is the time to consider buying into this undervalued stock, as management announced a special one-time dividend of $0.40 in the earnings report. Shareholders of record on July 2nd will receive the distribution on July 19th, so there\u2019s still time to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nMedifast (MED) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nMedifast (NYSE:MED) hasn\u2019t yet caught the wider weight loss wave affecting many pharma stocks. Still, there is long-term potential for this nutrition and weight loss company to expand its product sales across various platforms, including multi-level marketing.\n\nMedifast reported a solid $0.76 earnings per share in the first quarter. The company\u2019s balance sheet is strong, boasting a $150 million cash reserve with zero debt, which is crucial in today\u2019s high-rate environment. Additionally, executives are striving to differentiate Medifast from larger weight loss competitors.\n\nManagement is shifting toward a more comprehensive and holistic approach to customer management, including guided habit development and personalized coaching. Earnings statements indicate that \u201c2024 will be a year of investment for future growth.\u201d While this may impact the sustainability of today\u2019s 20% dividend yield, it does not diminish the undervalued stock\u2019s long-term upside potential.\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX)\n\nSource: Nvidia\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) may be the most objectively undervalued stock on this list, trading at just 7x earnings and 0.5x sales while remaining an overlooked player in the green tech and sustainable driving sector. The company manufactures various automotive parts that enhance emission reductions and support zero-emission technologies, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nWhile pure EV plays like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are currently losing favor due to declining consumer interest, evidenced by the surge in hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales, Garrett Motion provides a bridge for investors seeking long-term sustainability while acknowledging that global EV adoption is a long-term goal.\n\nThe recent dip in Garrett Motion\u2019s stock followed an earnings report showing a 6% drop in quarterly sales; however, its annual sales remained stable, and the company maintained healthy margins and free cash flow. This stock is underappreciated and undervalued as investors chase more prominent growth opportunities. As automakers revise their EV planning timelines, expect Garrett Motion to become a major small-cap value stock in the future market.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-consumer eCommerce continues to soar in popularity, as demonstrated by giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT), a lesser-known but rising eCommerce force, targets the massive B2B market by creating a comprehensive platform for businesses to source products and manage all associated logistics.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing and payment processing. GigaCloud addresses these challenges by providing a complete suite of scaled B2B eCommerce solutions, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment and secure cross-border payment processing.\n\nGigaCloud\u2019s financial metrics are particularly impressive. With a low price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.9 \u2014 well below the tech sector average of 36x \u2014 the undervalued stock doubled its earnings per share over the last few quarters and has robust free cash flow despite trading at (relatively) bottom-barrel pricing.\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen Warren Buffett vouches for a stock, pay attention. This focus makes Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) stand out as a remarkable choice among undervalued stocks, especially given the billionaire\u2019s investment. Even as Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) appeared more inclined toward selling than buying, his $167 million investment in Sirius XM signals a positive indicator for value investors. Given the wider market skepticism, it\u2019s an even more noteworthy play. Sirius XM remains one of the most heavily shorted stocks today at 21% short interest. So why is Buffett optimistic about this stock?\n\nBuffett\u2019s interest in Sirius XM goes beyond planned corporate realignment; he views it as a top-notch value investment. Despite trading at low multiples, Sirius XM has a promising future. The company is a cash-generating powerhouse, with EBITDA margins exceeding 30% for the last four years and maintaining a free cash flow of over $1 billion. Additionally, Sirius XM offers a solid dividend yield of 4.69% with a payout ratio of 31%, demonstrating efficient cash management by its leadership in rewarding shareholders while strategically adjusting its market presence.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +28.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlibaba is expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.9%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.26 points to a change of -4.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.17 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for BABA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $34.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.6%. The $137.97 billion and $147.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.7% and +7.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $30.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +12.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's Taobao and Tmall Group is working with ByteDance-owned Douyin to attract users from the Chinese short video platform, as the e-commerce giant spends hundreds of billions of yuan for its promotions in the mainland's annual midyear shopping festival.\n\nThe domestic e-commerce unit of Alibaba, which also owns the South China Morning Post, recently joined hands with Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, to help merchants on the Taobao and Tmall platforms acquire customers from the short video app's users, according to information provided by the group on Monday.\n\nThe so-called \"Star Cube Plan\", jointly launched by Alibaba-affiliated digital marketing platform Alimama and Douyin's digital marketing tool Xingtu, aims to help the merchants achieve \"marketing on Douyin, transaction on Taobao\", according to Taobao and Tmall Group.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe merchants will be able to post advertisements on Douyin, and monitor how users are directed to, browse and make purchases on their Taobao and Tmall stores after seeing the ads.\n\nThe move marks the latest in a series of efforts by the domestic e-commerce unit to seek new growth by attracting customers from other platforms through external cooperation, as the top player in China's online shopping market is grappling with heightened competition with newer rivals including PDD Holdings and even Douyin itself.\n\nThe company has so far reached such deals with more than 200 online platforms including those of Shenzhen-based tech giant Tencent Holdings, it said.\n\nLast September, Alibaba and Tencent announced a deal to place ads on WeChat's short-video sharing platform Channels, which can be linked to shops and live-streaming rooms on Taobao and Tmall. That followed similar previous collaborations with blogging features and mini-programmes on the ubiquitous social media app.\n\nAlibaba's collaboration with Douyin, which comes ahead of China's second-largest online sales event - the 618 shopping festival - is also among a slew of measures unveiled on Monday by the Taobao and Tmall Group to encourage consumers and merchants to participate in the midyear campaign.\n\nThe unit said it has allocated over 200 billion yuan (US$27.7 million) - the highest amount in its 618 festival history - for a rapid settlement programme for eligible merchants, to ease the cash flow pressure especially for small and medium enterprises.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also partnering with Alibaba's logistics unit Cainiao and fintech spin-off Ant Group to provide logistics subsidies and shipping insurance deals, while currently offering free access to more than 10 artificial intelligence tools for all Taobao and Tmall merchants.\n\nThe Alibaba company logo seen on its main office building in Shenzhen, China.

Photo: Shutterstock Images>\n\nOn the consumer side, the unit said it will give away over 10 billion yuan in coupons to more than 35 million 88VIP members and another 5 billion yuan for live-streaming rewards, specific categories, and virtual sales venues.\n\nIt also upgraded the price guarantee feature for this year's event, allowing Tmall consumers to receive a refund on price differences until July 5, in case of any further discounts given after their purchases.\n\nRolling out in the weeks leading up to June 18, the shopping event will see major e-commerce players from Alibaba to JD.com competing for shoppers with steep discounts, cash subsidies and colourful marketing campaigns.\n\nAlibaba is set to kick off the first sales window for the 618 event at 8pm Monday, followed by a second starting at 8pm on May 31, after announcing earlier that it would skip a presales stage this year, which used to allow consumers to make a deposit on goods they wanted to buy to guarantee a low price during the actual sales period.\n\nJD.com, Alibaba's long-time rival in e-commerce, has undertaken a similar move this year to start direct sales of its 618 event on May 31.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Where Will Alibaba Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "With shares down a whopping 47% over the last five years, Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) has been dead money for long-term investors. The China-based e-commerce and technology conglomerate faces ongoing political uncertainty, market weakness, and competition from nimble rivals.\n\nCan the behemoth company turn itself over the next five years, or is it doomed to continued stagnation? Let's dig deeper.\n\nWhat went wrong for Alibaba?\n\nLike many online-focused companies, Alibaba performed well in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its stock price hitting its all-time high of around $313 in October 2020. Since then, its fortunes have reversed. The problem started in November 2020 when Chinese regulators began cracking down on local tech companies, fearing they had become too large and powerful.\n\nAlibaba's problem started when Chinese authorities blocked the planned initial public offering (IPO) of its fintech subsidiary, Ant Group. Over the subsequent years, both Alibaba and Ant Group have faced a series of multibillion-dollar fines over issues ranging from alleged anti-consumer practices toconsumer protection and corporate governance.\n\nKilling the golden goose\n\nThe good news is that a nearly $1 billion fine against Ant Group in 2023 is widely believed to be the end of China's brutal tech crackdown. As the Chinese economy continues to struggle, the New York Times reports that its government is starting to take a more business-friendly tone and policy stance. But the damage may already be done.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThrough almost half a decade of unpredictable and business-unfriendly policy (including the world's longest-lasting COVID-19 lockdown), China has made itself arguably uninvestable. Multinationals like Apple and Samsung are shifting their supply chains away from the country, while others plan no future investment in its once-coveted market.\n\nRetail investors should take note because this negative sentiment can impact Chinese stock valuations, even if operational results improve.\n\nThe next five years for Alibaba\n\nAs if the macro challenges weren't bad enough, Alibaba's core operations are also lackluster. While revenue increased by a modest 7% year over year to $30.7 billion, net income collapsed 96% to $127 million based on a drop in the value of its holdings in other publicly traded companies.\n\nAlibaba has its fingers in so many different pies that the performance of these often unrelated equities often overshadows its core e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. Over the coming years, the company's sprawling size could lower its efficiency and management focus, causing the market to continue discounting its valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile management reports that Alibaba's fourth quarter AI-related revenue grew by triple digits, this barely moved the needle in its cloud computing division, which only expanded 3% year over year (to $3.5 billion).\n\nTo be fair, Alibaba will undoubtedly become a leader in China's domestic artificial intelligence (AI) market. However, U.S. export controls on the most advanced AI chips could hamper its potential in international markets and hurt its margins by making it more expensive to train and run large language models (LLM) with less powerful and energy-efficient hardware.\n\nSell or avoid Alibaba stock\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 9.3, Alibaba looks cheap compared to its U.S. alternative, Amazon, which trades for 41 times earnings. Alibaba's management seems to be responding to this low valuation with buybacks -- repurchasing an eye-watering $4.8 billion worth of shares in the fourth quarter alone.\n\nSome investors like buybacks because they reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can theoretically increase the value of remaining stock units relative to future earnings. But buybacks don't address the core reasons why Alibaba's stock is so cheap in the first place.\n\nMany investors simply aren't willing to put money into a seemingly unpredictable and hostile Chinese market. And Alibaba's lumbering conglomeration of disjointed businesses makes it even less appealing. The company's AI prospects also look much worse than U.S. alternatives.\n\nWith all these long-term headwinds, Alibaba stock looks likely to underperform the S&P 500 over the next five years and possibly beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Sold Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Hand Over Fist Last Quarter. You Won't Believe What He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "Investors could do worse than investing in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. The collective gained 111%, on average, in 2023, thrashing the 24% gains of the S&P 500. The group has continued its winning ways, rising 22% on average so far this year, nearly double the 11% increase of the S&P 500 (as of this writing).\n\nThe common thread that unites these tech bellwethers is that they each have artificial intelligence (AI) in their DNA. In recent months, however, some investors have begun to fear that the rally that propelled the Magnificent Seven higher is no longer sustainable and have been looking to other quarters for growth.\n\nAmong those investors is billionaire David Tepper, who heads Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993. Tepper is worth roughly $20.6 billion and has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" for his knack for consistently outperforming his industry peers.\n\nIt's notable, then, that Tepper decreased his exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks to close out the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOut with the old...\n\nA regulatory filing released just this week revealed that Tepper had made big changes among his largest holdings, decreasing his stake in each of the five Magnificent Seven stocks in Appaloosa's portfolio.\n\nTepper cut his stake in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by 44%. He obviously still believes there's additional potential, since Appaloosa still owns 442,000 shares worth an estimated $417 million (as of this writing). It's still the fund's fifth largest holding at roughly 6% of the portfolio.\n\nThe move was probably strategic on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia stock is up a massive 546% since early last year, thanks to accelerating demand for its AI-centric processors. Given its remarkable run, there's likely not as much upside -- at least over the short term.\n\nTepper also slashed his stake in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock by 39%, though it remains a cornerstone holding. Appaloosa still owns 1.1 million shares worth about $531 million, as the fund's fourth-largest holding.\n\nMeta Platforms is the second-best performer among the Magnificent Seven, sporting gains of 293% since early last year. The digital advertising market is in the midst of a remarkable recovery, which will continue to boost Meta's fortunes, but Tepper clearly believes he can get better gains elsewhere.\n\nTepper also reduced his stakes in Microsoft by 18%, Alphabet by 10%, and Amazon by 3%, likely to raise funds for his latest purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo me, the most surprising part of Tepper's move wasn't so much what he sold but what he bought instead, building his positions in a number of well-known Chinese stocks.\n\n...In with the new\n\nAppaloosa's biggest additions in Q1 are among China's most well-known companies.\n\nTepper boosted his stake in Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) by 158%. Appaloosa now owns 11.25 million shares worth an estimated $814 million. That makes the company Appaloosa's No. 1 holding at more than 12% of the portfolio.\n\nAlibaba is best known as one of the largest e-commerce providers in China, which includes its Taobao and T-mall sites. Alibaba Cloud is the world's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure provider, with 4% of the market, behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, with 31%, 25%, and 11%, respectively. The company has also been investing heavily in AI to boost its competitive advantages and has noted that much of its recent cloud growth has been driven by AI.\n\nTepper also increased his stake in PDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD), also known as Pinduoduo, by 171%. Appaloosa now owns 2.1 million shares worth an estimated $244 million. As a result, it has risen to its ninth-largest holding at nearly 4% of the portfolio.\n\nPinduoduo's online marketplace has become the world's second-largest e-commerce company and the largest in China. The company is leveraging its position by expanding internationally with its Temu platform and has been growing faster than its larger rival, Alibaba.\n\nFinally, Tepper increased his stake in China's search leader Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) by 188%. The hedge fund now owns 1.8 million shares worth an estimated $190 million. As a result, it has risen to its 10th-largest holding at roughly 3% of the portfolio.\n\nAside from its search supremacy, Baidu is one of the largest digital advertisers in China and provides a host of internet and AI-related services.\n\nShould investors follow suit?\n\nIt isn't too surprising that Tepper would see value in stocks from China. Earlier this year, China's CSI 300 Index fell to a five-year low as the country's economy continued to struggle. Contracting manufacturing activity, which had fallen for four successive months, helped fuel the decline.\n\nThis has driven the valuations of some of China's most popular stocks to multi-year lows. Even after an uptick in Q1, PDD, Alibaba, and Baidu are selling for 25 times, 20 times, and 14 times trailing 12-month earnings, a discount to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500.\n\nTepper's moves may have been wise. Over the past few months, there have been improvements in China's economic prospects. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.3% year over year in Q1, while the manufacturing and services sectors grew by 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nThat said, investors should be aware of the additional risk factors that are part of investing in China. The economy is still a wild card, government crackdowns can negatively affect investments, and relations between China and the U.S. are frequently rocky.\n\nWhile Tepper's picks may seem intriguing, investors should merely use this information as a starting point and do their own research to determine if these stocks are a good fit with their investing philosophy and risk tolerance.\n\nIt's worth noting that Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Alphabet collectively still make up 38% of Tepper's portfolio, so he obviously believes each of these stocks has room to run. However, it's clear from his purchases this quarter that Tepper believes China stocks could have more upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Alibaba Tops Revenue Estimates, but Shares Fall. Is This a Great Opportunity to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "Shares of Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) fell following mixed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results that saw the Chinese e-commerce giant handily top analyst revenue estimates. The stock has had a difficult past five years, with its shares cut in half over that period. Let's look at the company's most recent results and see if a turnaround could be in the cards.\n\nSolid revenue growth\n\nFourth-quarter revenue rose 7% to $30.7 billion, which topped analyst estimates calling for about $30.4 billion. The company's largest segment -- comprising its e-commerce sites Taobao and Tmall -- grew revenue 4% to $12.9 billion. The segment saw orders and gross merchandise value (GMV) on its platform grow by double-digits.\n\nThe e-commerce segment has seen increased competitive pressure over the past few years, especially from Pinduoduo, owned by PDD Holdings. As a result, Alibaba has invested in being more price competitive to help drive customer growth. Its segment EBITA (earnings before interest taxes and amortization), however, fell 1%.\n\nLooking ahead, the company said it expects Taobao and Tmall GMV to return to healthy growth this new fiscal year and that it will launch new products to help better monetize the platform.\n\nThe cloud intelligence group, which is akin to Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure, saw revenue grow 3% to $3.5 billion. Artificial intelligence (AI) related revenue soared triple-digits. Alibaba has been letting low-margin project-based contracts roll off in an effort to be more profitable. The benefits of this strategy could be seen in the segment's adjusted EBITA, which rose 45% to $198 million.\n\nAlibaba is expecting to return to double-digit cloud growth in the second half of fiscal 2025, as it becomes the premier AI development platform in China.\n\nRevenue for its international commerce retail business soared 45% to $3.8 billion, driven by strong cross-border business from AliExpress and Trendyol. However, the loss in the segment increased due to continued investment.\n\nThe company's Cainiao smart logistics network revenue jumped 30% to $3.4 billion, powered by cross-border fulfillment services supporting AliExpress. The segment, however, lost money due to retention incentives given to employees after the company pulled an IPO that was planned for the unit.\n\nIts local services segment revenue climbed 19% to $2 billion, led by food delivery business Ele.me and navigation service Amap. Its digital media and entertainment unit, meanwhile, saw revenue decline -1% to $685 million. Both units lost money in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted earnings per ADS (American depositary share) fell 5% in the quarter to $1.40, while adjusted EBITDA also fell 5% to $3.3 billion. Free cash flow came in at $2.1 billion. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe quarter was mixed with revenue rising and profitability falling, but overall it looks like the company is moving in the right direction. Growth had slowed at Alibaba, but the company is using its ample cash flow to reinvest back into the business to spur future growth.\n\nWhile these investments dampened profitability in the near term, it should pay off longer term. Alibaba is often compared to Amazon in the U.S. and this is a common strategy its U.S. counterpart has used over the years. The company needed to invest across its business units, and early progress is clearly being made, from growing its GMV double-digits last quarter to triple-digit growth for AI services in its cloud business to strong growth in its cross-border international commerce businesses.\n\nA cheap stock\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of just over 9 times, Alibaba is selling for a big discount to what it has in the past. The stock is trading as if the company is in secular decline, but it has continued to grow its revenue despite a difficult Chinese economy the last few years and increased e-commerce competition. The company also has $85.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet. BABA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe market's malaise with the stock, however, could be good news for investors. The stock is cheap, and there are certainly signs that a turnaround could be coming. The company has made its business units more independent and is allowing them to make the necessary investments to grow. Given its cash horde and cash flow, the company has a lot of money to invest to both drive future growth and buy back its inexpensive stock.\n\nThat should be a solid recipe for success. With shares down following the recent earnings report, now is a good time to bet on this cheap stock. Its various businesses are showing signs of improvement, and getting ahead of a potential company turnaround would be a good move for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

These three chances are available. Even if there may be some doubt about these equities, a further examination reveals solid prospects for future development.\n\nTo begin with, the first company is resilient against market challenges.\u00a0This\u00a0is reflected in its foreign market development and revenue diversification,\u00a0especially\u00a0through international digital commerce. Its smart investments and strong financial performance reflect its ability to prosper in a competitive environment.\n\nMoreover, the second one has solid growth in its direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector. This marks\u00a0a sharp rise in revenue and a steadily expanding subscriber base.\u00a0This\u00a0also indicates the company\u2019s edge in shifting consumers\u2019 preferences. The company may attain long-term growth and has established a solid lead in the streaming sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLastly, the third one may have a\u00a0major\u00a0role in the tech sector\u2019s future because of its technical innovations.\u00a0This\u00a0reflects the improvements in its semiconductor production processes. Significant alliances and recognition also support its legitimacy and long-term success potential.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Why Alibaba Stock Makes Even More Sense to Buy Today. BABA\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) International Digital Commerce (AIDC) reports solid top-line growth. Sales rose 45% year-over-year (YoY). Improvements in the customer experience and the rise of international retail operations are the main drivers of this boost. Indeed, investments in vital markets have accelerated growth and enhanced brand awareness, as shown in Trendyol\u2019s spread throughout the Gulf region.\n\nMoreover, despite market competition, Alibaba had an\u00a08% YoY growth in consolidated revenue in fiscal 2024. A double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income demonstrates solid operational profitability and efficiency. Through its share repurchase program, Alibaba has proved that it\u00a0is focused\u00a0on integrating value growth. In fiscal 2024, the number of outstanding shares reduced by 5.1% YoY. In addition, the business announced $4 billion in cash dividends for 2024.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0illustrates its sharp cash flow creation and investor-friendly capital allocation moves.\n\nLastly, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s revenue grew by\u00a03% YoY in Q4 2024, mostly from adopting\u00a0AI-related products and high-quality revenues from public cloud usage. The cloud segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA had a noteworthy 45% growth, primarily attributed to enhanced product mix and operational edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nParamount (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, Paramount\u2019s (NASDAQ:PARA) D2C business had a solid 24% YoY top-line growth. Through a boost in subscribers and an uplift in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), Paramount+\u2019s top line surged by 51% YoY. Subscriptions to Paramount+ exceeded 71 million, with a rapid net increase of 3.7 million throughout the quarter. Similarly, the D2C division had a\u00a031% increase\u00a0in advertising income,\u00a0mostly\u00a0due to growth from Pluto TV and Paramount+ and advantages from Super Bowl LVIII. Moreover, new subscriber additions and increases in the price of Paramount+ memberships drove a notable 22% increase in subscription income.\n\nAdditionally, the D2C segment\u2019s robust revenue growth and growing subscriber base highlight Paramount\u2019s progressive\u00a0content distribution tactics and the rising demand for its streaming platforms. The company\u2019s digital advertising environment is attractive, and its monetization initiatives have been successful, as seen by the significant growth in advertising income. Thus, these patterns indicate a positive future for Paramount\u2019s D2C business, with room to grow and diversify income streams.\n\nOverall, the considerable increase in advertising revenue from high-profile events like the Super Bowl reflects the segment\u2019s tremendous commercial attractiveness.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the announcement of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 14A, which uses High NA EUV technology, Intel has made a significant scientific development in the structural evolution of semiconductors. Similarly, H2 2024\u00a0is anticipated\u00a0to see the start of the Intel 20A production ramp, illustrating a steady advancement towards sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Moreover, the Intel 18A manufacturing ramp is scheduled to begin in early 2025, with Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake already under fabrication.\n\nFurther, Intel was given the\u00a0largest\u00a0award under the CHIPS and Science Act, with projected grants, tax breaks, and loans totaling more than $45 billion. Intel Vision 2024\u00a0was experienced\u00a0by over 1K esteemed clients and associates. These include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Bosch, Supermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY). No doubt, Intel has a lead in the semiconductor industry.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "You're, of course, familiar with e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). It's one of the world's biggest companies (as measured by market cap), while its stock is one of the market's best-performing equities since the company went public back in 1997, up nearly 250,000% from that point. You may even be a shareholder.\n\nAs the adage goes, though, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Although Amazon stock's historical performance is nothing less than incredible, there are more promising prospects for the foreseeable future. Here's a closer look at three of these better bets.\n\nAlibaba\n\nDon't panic if you already own a stake in Amazon. It's still a powerhouse company. You'll be fine.\n\nIf you have some idle cash you're ready to put to work with some new stock picks, though, consider stepping into the Amazon of China. That's Alibaba(NYSE: BABA), the parent company of China's e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao.\n\nAny investor keeping tabs on China in general -- and Alibaba in particular -- likely knows the past few years have been tough. China's economy has been struggling due to the lingering impact of extended COVID-19 lockdowns. And Alibaba itself has been mired in internal challenges. It's teased the idea of divesting its cloud computing and logistics arms, for instance, suggesting the company doesn't have a great deal of faith that it can make either one as viable as it would like them to be.\n\nBoth spinoffs have been canceled in the meantime, though, with the company saying it will instead invest time and resources to make both of them better profit centers. The indecision tacitly suggests that Alibaba isn't actually sure what it should do; it may be doing something it doesn't actually want to do.\n\nHowever, some important details are being overlooked amid all the corporate drama. That is, China's economy is seemingly on the mend. The country's consumer prices grew for a third straight month in April, while producer prices fell again, suggesting consumer demand is perking up.\n\nUnderscoring this argument is March's 3.1% year-over-year growth in China's retail sales on top of the hefty 10.6% retail-spending surge in March of last year. This progress is being made against the backdrop of the nation's first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.3%, accelerating from Q4's growth pace of 5.2%, making China one of the few countries to see its economy pick up steam during the three-month stretch.\n\nAlibaba stock plunged this week anyway after its first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations. Just keep things in perspective. Last quarter's top line was still up 7% year over year. That's respectable for a company amid multiple overhauls. The stock's stumble is a buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nDutch Bros\n\nWhen you think of coffee houses, you most likely think of coffee titan Starbucks. And rightfully so. There are nearly 39,000 Starbucks locales peppered across the planet, with roughly 16,600 of these stores found within the United States. It's tough not to come across one when you're out and about.\n\nAn up-and-coming coffee rival called Dutch Bros(NYSE: BROS), however, should have Starbucks' management looking over its shoulders.\n\nDutch Bros is a distinctly different concept. Whereas the posh and polished feel of the typical Starbucks location was highly marketable during the early 2000s and then again in the 2000-teens, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a shift that was already underway even before the contagion took hold. That is, increasingly more consumers are now less interested in form and formality and are more interested in functional, casual experiences.\n\nThat's Dutch Bros, to be sure. It only operates coffee and beverage drive-thrus, and anyone who's visited one readily recognizes that each stand has its own personality reflecting the individual people working there. As the company says of itself, \"We may sell coffee, but we're in the relationship business.\"\n\nThe thing is, the numbers and data suggest this is precisely what America's consumers increasingly want. Last quarter's top line was up 39% year over year, largely thanks to the 45 new stores opened during its fiscal first quarter ending in March. This only brings the store count up to 876 locations, far fewer than Starbucks' footprint. However, for Dutch Bros, the company's long-term target of 4,000 drive-thrus is certainly an achievable goal. The stock should reflect this growth as it's achieved.\n\nDraftKings\n\nLast but not least, add DraftKings(NASDAQ: DKNG) to your list of unstoppable stocks that are better buys than Amazon at this time.\u00a0Simply put, DraftKings is a sports-betting stock. In states where it's legal to do so, its app and website allow consumers to place various wagers on a wide range of sporting events.\n\nIt's not a brand-new business but is a relatively young and immature industry. The U.S. Supreme Court lifted the federal sports-betting ban in just 2018. Any such wagering before then was illegal, except in a handful of states. Even then, it was highly restricted. Although it's no longer federally prohibited, not every state permits it yet, and the ones that do aren't necessarily on board with mobile or internet-based sports betting.\n\nThe legalization movement is gaining traction, though. That's why Goldman Sachs believes the country's current yearly sports-betting handle (the total amount of money people wager) of around $10 billion could eventually swell to $45 billion. Market researcher Imarc further fleshes out the industry's prospective future by suggesting it will grow at an annualized pace of more than 12% through 2032.\n\nDraftKings is already clearly showing it's capable of capitalizing on this opportunity, too. Last year's top line was up 66% year over year, nearly halving the company's operating loss. Analysts are calling for comparable growth all the way through 2027, with a swing to a profit in the cards as soon as next year.\n\nSee, not only do more legalization and more adoption obviously help, but DraftKings also becomes more fiscally efficient the longer it operates within a state and retains a customer. An acquired bettor tends to become profitable between the second and third year they're a DraftKings user.\n\nGiven that much of its customer base has not yet been around that long -- but soon will be -- don't be surprised to see profit growth dramatically outpace revenue growth from here. This, of course, creates a tailwind for the stock, which has been performing quite well of late anyway. The lull since March makes for an attractive entry point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in DraftKings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in DraftKings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and DraftKings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Alibaba Stock Is Beaten Down Now, but It Could 10X",
        "content": "When Alibaba Group(NYSE: BABA) went public at $68 per share on Sept. 18, 2014, it raised $25 billion and became the largest initial public offering (IPO) in U.S. history. At the time, the bulls were impressed by the Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader's rapid growth rates.\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2020, Alibaba's stock reached its record high of $312.87. That was a near five-bagger gain for its initial investors, and many analysts were convinced its stock could go even higher over the next few years. Image source: Alibaba.\n\nBut today, Alibaba's stock trades at about $81. Its growth cooled off as it faced tougher regulatory, macroeconomic, and competitive headwinds, and the bulls hastily retreated. Nevertheless, that sell-off might still represent a golden buying opportunity for long-term investors who can stomach all the near-term volatility. In fact, I believe Alibaba's stock could rise by at least 10 times over the next decade if it resolves its most pressing issues.\n\nWhat are Alibaba's most pressing challenges?\n\nBack in 2021, China's antitrust regulators hit Alibaba with a record $2.75 billion fine and barred its e-commerce business from locking in its merchants with exclusive deals, using aggressive loss-leading promotions, and making unapproved investments. Those restrictions eroded Alibaba's defenses against aggressive competitors like PDD Holdings and JD.com. China's economy also struggled to expand through the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government hobbled its own recovery with unpredictable \"zero-COVID\" lockdowns. Alibaba's cloud business also struggled as the macro headwinds drove companies to rein in their software spending.\n\nThat messy mix of regulatory, competitive, and macro headwinds caused Alibaba's growth to decelerate significantly in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 (which ended last March). But in fiscal 2024, its top- and bottom-line growth accelerated again.\n\nMetric FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Revenue growth 41% 19% 2% 8% Adjusted net income growth 30% (21%) 4% 11%\n\nData source: Alibaba.\n\nThat acceleration was driven by the expansion of its overseas e-commerce marketplaces (including Lazada in Southeast Asia, Trendyol in Turkey, and AliExpress for cross-border sales) and its Cainiao logistics business. Its Chinese e-commerce and cloud businesses also stabilized in the second half of the year as the macro environment improved.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba generated so much cash it bought back $12.5 billion in shares in fiscal 2024 and approved its first annual cash dividend of $1 per American depositary receipt (ADR). At its current price, that dividend equals a forward yield of 1.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba looks undervalued relative to its growth potential\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% as its net income rises at a CAGR of 26%.\n\nAt 13 times forward earnings and 1 times next year's sales, Alibaba's stock looks undervalued relative to its growth rates. But that's because its valuations are being squeezed by the tensions between the U.S. and China, doubts about its new CEO Eddie Wu, and competitive concerns in the e-commerce and cloud markets. The recent cancellations of its cloud and logistics IPOs also suggest that Alibaba overestimated the market's interest in those two units as stand-alone businesses.\n\nWhy it has a viable path toward a 10-bagger gain\n\nYet Alibaba still has plenty of room to grow. According to Statista Market Insights, China's e-commerce market could expand at a CAGR of 10% from 2024 to 2029, while the cloud market could grow at a CAGR of 19% from 2024 to 2028.\n\nIf Alibaba stabilizes its Chinese e-commerce sales, expands its overseas e-commerce business, and stays ahead of its smaller competitors in the cloud market, it could grow its revenue at a CAGR of 10% over the next decade. If that happens, its revenue would rise from 941 billion yuan ($130 billion) in fiscal 2024 to 2.45 trillion yuan ($340 billion) in fiscal 2034.\n\nIt's also likely that Alibaba will continue to cut costs and buy back more shares to boost its profits. If its grows its bottom line at a CAGR of 20% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2034, its adjusted earnings per ADS would rise from 62.23 yuan ($8.62) to 385 yuan ($53.36).\n\nIf it's still trading at 13 times earnings by then, its stock price would rise to nearly $700. A slightly higher multiple of 16 would boost its stock price to more than $850 -- which would be more than a 10-bagger gain from its current price.\n\nBut investors should mind the long-term challenges\n\nAlibaba has a viable path toward generating big gains over the next decade, but it needs to gradually widen its moat and leverage its scale to marginalize its smaller competitors without incurring the wrath of the antitrust authorities again. It would also benefit from friendlier trade relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nI'm not saying that Alibaba's stock will definitely soar 10 times within the next 10 years. But I believe it's a compelling contrarian investment at its current valuations -- and it could head a lot higher if investors turn bullish on China's top stocks again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "China Goes All In As Beijing Vows To Buy Unsold Properties: Chinese Stocks Rally, Copper Hits All-Time Highs\n\nXi Jinping\u2019s government has introduced its most aggressive measures to date to rescue China\u2019s struggling property market.\n\nOn Thursday, Beijing announced a new plan that included easing mortgage regulations and urged local governments to purchase unsold homes, reflecting the authorities\u2019 heightened concern over the sector\u2019s impact on economic growth.\n\nThe support package comprised several key components designed to revitalize the housing market. First-time homebuyers will benefit from reduced down-payment requirements of 15%, while second-home purchases require only 25%. Additionally, the central bank is providing 300 billion yuan ($42 billion) in funding to help government-backed firms acquire surplus inventory from developers, which will then be converted into affordable housing.\n\nChina\u2019s finance ministry conducted the auction for the first batch of its special treasury bonds on Friday, marking the beginning of a long-anticipated stimulus program.\n\nZhu Ning, professor of finance at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, was interviewed by Bloomberg TV and said the current measures were somewhat similar to the bailout of financial institutions during the Great Financial Crisis. He noted that without direct intervention and credit extension by the central government to the real estate market, it was too soon to consider the crisis resolved.\n\nIn related news, recent data revealed China\u2019s industrial production expanded by 6.7% year-on-year in April 2024, surpassing market forecasts of 5.5% and accelerating from a 4.5% increase in the previous month. Despite sluggish retail sales, which marked the weakest growth since July 2023, China\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 5.0% in April 2024. This was the lowest rate since November 2023 and better than both the previous month\u2019s and market estimates of 5.2%.\n\nChinese Stocks And Proxies Rally\n\nStocks and commodities tied to China rallied to the news, reflecting investors upbeat sentiment following the government measures.\n\nThe onshore Shanghai Composite Index rose by 1% to close at 3,154, while the Shenzhen Component Index gained 1.1% to 9,709.\n\nStruggling real estate developers saw significant gains, with Greenland Holdings, Poly Real Estate and China Fortune rising by over 10% in a single day.\n\nThe Hang Seng Index climbed by 0.91%, reaching its highest level in nine and a half months. Leading the charge were property developer Country Garden Services Holdings and Ping An Insurance, which rose by 9% and 5%, respectively.\n\nChinese American Depository Receipts (ADR) also edged slightly higher at the U.S. market open on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) and PDD Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PDD) rose 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively.\n\nOn Thursday, the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB), which offers exposure to Chinese tech stocks, rose 2.7%, reaching the highest level since February 2023.\n\nCopper, one of the commodities most sensitive to the Chinese economy, surged by nearly 3% to $5 per pound, marking its strongest session since early April and reaching fresh all-time highs.\n\nChart: Copper Hits $5 Per Pound, Sets New Record Highs\n\nRead Now: \u2018Big Short\u2019 Investor Michael Burry Bets Heavy On Gold, Renewable Energy Stocks, Exits Amazon, Alphabet\n\nThis image was created using artificial intelligence MidJourney.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article China Goes All In As Beijing Vows To Buy Unsold Properties: Chinese Stocks Rally, Copper Hits All-Time Highs originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Alibaba (BABA) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alibaba (BABA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.35, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.35 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy, representing 82.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for BABA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for BABA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Alibaba, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in BABA?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.4% over the past month to $8.26.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Alibaba. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alibaba with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Time for Cloud ETFs on Earnings Strength &amp; Promising Growth?",
        "content": "Cloud computing has been at the forefront of the growth in technology for the past few years, offering efficient solutions for businesses and consumers. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow from $626.4 billion in 2023 to $1.27 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.1%, per MarketsandMarkets.\n\nThe widespread adoption of remote work and e-commerce has continued to fuel the need for scalable and reliable cloud solutions. Moreover, advancements in cloud technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and cybersecurity enhancements, have expanded the use cases for cloud services, attracting a broader customer base.\n\nThe global cloud computing market is led by three mega cloud service providers \u2014 Microsoft, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. The total cloud infrastructure market was worth $76 billion worldwide at the end of Q1 of 2024, which marked a year-over-year rise of 21%.\n\nAccording to recent data from Synergy Research Group cited on CRN, AWS, Microsoft and Google collectively managed a 67% share of the $76 billion global cloud infrastructure services market in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN recently reported their quarterly financial cloud numbers for the first quarter of 2024. Each company logged record quarterly cloud sales thanks to double-digit growth rates.\n\nInside Mega Cloud\u2019s Size in Q1\n\nCombined, these three cloud leaders generated more than $61 billion in total sales in the first quarter of 2024. Their cloud units, in fact, boosted total revenue growth as clients are increasingly adopting AI services. Growth rates are rebounding from the relative lows seen through most of 2023.\n\nIndividually, Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud business generated $26.7 billion in total sales (up 21% year over year) during the quarter, meaning Microsoft\u2019s cloud group now has a run rate of $107 billion.\n\nAWS generated just over $25 billion in revenues (up 17% year over year). This means Amazon\u2019s cloud business now has an annual run rate of $100 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud reported total sales of $9.6 billion (up 28% year over year). This shows that Alphabet\u2019s cloud business currently has an annual run rate of $38.4 billion.\n\nIn terms of global market share, AWS is leading (with a 31% share), followed by Microsoft (25%) and Google (11%). Other cloud market-share leaders of the first quarter included Alibaba BABA at 4% market share and Salesforce CRM at 3% cloud share.\n\nOther Companies\u2019 Soaring Cloud Demand\n\nAlibaba\u2019s revenues from Cloud Intelligence Group grew 3% year over yeardespite slashing prices in the first quarter. Like Alibaba, Baidu BIDU also came up with upbeat results thanks to the boom in AI Cloud revenue. Baidu\u2019s AI Cloud Group revenues grew by 12% year over year, driven by generative AI and foundation models, which Baidu looks to strengthen further.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Growth in 2024\n\nAccording to Gartner Forecasts, global end-user spending on public cloud services is forecast will grow 20.4% to $678.8 billion in 2024, up from $563.6 billion in 2023. All segments of the cloud market are expected to see growth in 2024. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is forecast to experience the highest end-user spending growth in 2024 at 26.6%, followed by platform-as-a-service (PaaS) at 21.5%.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nWisdomtree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD, Global X Cloud Computing ETF CLOU, Amplify Global Cloud Technology ETF IVES, Fidelity Cloud Computing ETF FCLD and Cloud Computing ETF First Trust SKYY are some of the ETFs that can be played on the boom. All these ETFs have gained in the range of 4% to 5% in the past week.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "China's e-commerce market has the potential to further expand in the next few years amid improved penetration by internet platform operators into key sectors, despite a slowdown in retail sales, according to a senior JPMorgan analyst.\n\n\"I feel relatively positive about the outlook for e-commerce growth over the next few years,\" Alex Yao, co-head of Asia technology, media and telecommunications research at JPMorgan, said in an interview with the South China Morning Post on Thursday. \"Even if offline retail [activity] remains moderate, online [sales] could see double-digit growth just by taking market share from [bricks-and-mortar stores].\"\n\n\"There is ample room for [e-commerce platform operators] to take market share if they are able to continuously improve their value proposition to stakeholders, particularly consumers,\" Yao said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nThis week, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings both beat their quarterly earnings forecast, providing a positive indicator for domestic consumption in the world's second-largest economy, which has the biggest number of internet users.\n\nAlibaba, owner of the Post, reported a 7 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue in the March quarter, while Tencent posted a 6 per cent growth in the same period.\n\nBaidu and JD.com this week reported quarterly revenue gains of 1 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.\n\n\"In general, the sector's revenue is above our expectations,\" Yao said. He added that there has been \"a very robust improvement in online penetration across many key verticals\", which means consumer and enterprise activities continue to migrate from offline to online.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Looking into the rest of 2024, this online penetration will most likely continue to drive the sector's revenue growth,\" Yao said.\n\nExpress workers sort out parcels on an assembly line at an e-commerce logistics industrial estate in Lianyungang, a city in eastern Jiangsu province, on February 16, 2024.

Photo: NurPhoto via Getty Images>\n\nChina's e-commerce sector achieved a 12 per cent overall growth in the first three months of the year, according to data from JPMorgan. By comparison, total domestic retail sales grew 3.1 per cent in March and 5.5 per cent in the combined January-to-February period.\n\n\"The gap between online growth rates and total industry growth rates is widening,\" Yao said, as he predicted domestic e-commerce competition to remain at a high level in the next few years.\n\n\"E-commerce is probably the most intensively-competitive market in China's internet space,\" he said.\n\nDomestic e-commerce pioneers Alibaba and JD.com currently face increased pressure from younger online retail services providers, including PDD Holding's Pinduoduo and ByteDance-owned Douyin.\n\nOnline retail platforms AliExpress and Temu ranked as the two fastest-growing apps in South Korea in 2023, according to market research firm WiseApp. Photos: Shutterstock alt=Online retail platforms AliExpress and Temu ranked as the two fastest-growing apps in South Korea in 2023, according to market research firm WiseApp. Photos: Shutterstock>\n\nWeak consumer spending and greater domestic competition has prompted Chinese e-commerce firms to seek new growth opportunities overseas.\n\nCross-border e-commerce, according to Yao, could provide a \"big structural growth opportunity\" for China's e-commerce platform operators over the next three to five years.\n\nAlibaba and PDD, for example, have been aggressively expanding their foothold in South Korea, offering prices as low as US$1 for some small gadgets on their overseas shopping platforms AliExpress and Temu, respectively.\n\nYao, however, cautioned that it is \"critically important\" for Chinese companies to manage geopolitical risks in different markets, which is one of the biggest challenges facing the internet industry as a whole.\n\nTikTok, which had more than 500,000 merchants selling goods in the United States via its TikTok Shop operation, recently filed a lawsuit to overturn a new federal law signed by US President Joe Biden that seeks to ban the popular short video app in the country unless parent ByteDance divests its US business.\n\nThe progress of artificial intelligence development efforts in mainland China are being hampered by rigid technology trade restrictions imposed by the United States government. Image: Shutterstock alt=The progress of artificial intelligence development efforts in mainland China are being hampered by rigid technology trade restrictions imposed by the United States government. Image: Shutterstock>\n\nBeyond e-commerce, Yao said the efforts by Chinese companies - from start-ups to Big Tech firms such as Alibaba and Baidu - in the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) arena ultimately depend on having the talent and semiconductors to drive forward these endeavours.\n\nAdvanced chips, such as the graphics processing units from Nvidia, are highly sought after on the mainland for data centres used in various generative AI development projects.\n\nYao suggested that Chinese companies with in-house chip-design capabilities and foreign semiconductor manufacturing partners \"are relatively better positioned\" at present.\n\nExisting US tech trade restrictions, however, continue to make things difficult for AI development to progress more quickly on the mainland.\n\nAlibaba chairman Joe Tsai last month said China trails the US in the global race to lead AI development by about two years.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Friday as warnings from a slew of Federal Reserve officials saw investors reassess expectations of interest rate cuts, while mixed economic readings from China prompted increased caution.\n\nRegional markets took a weak lead-in from Wall Street, as U.S. stock benchmarks closed lower after briefly touching record highs. U.S. stock index futures also tread water in Asian trade.\n\nA string of Fed officials warned that it was still too soon to call for interest rate cuts by the central bank, and that the Fed needed more confidence to begin loosening policy.\n\nTheir comments largely undermined optimism over some softer U.S. consumer inflation readings for April, which had seen investors begin pricing in an increased possibility of a September rate cut.\n\nSome middling economic data from China also weighed on sentiment on Friday, although the country\u2019s major tech companies were a sole bright spot among Asian shares.\n\nChinese markets retreat on mixed data\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite fell about 0.2%, as a flurry of economic readings presented a mixed outlook for Asia\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nIndustrial production grew more than expected in April, indicating that manufacturing activity was recovering. But on the other hand, retail sales missed expectations by a wide margin, as did fixed asset investment.\n\nOther data showed a sustained decline in Chinese house prices, which undermined recent optimism over government efforts to support the beleaguered property sector.\n\nConcerns over China\u2019s economy saw Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index trim a bulk of its early gains, with the index now trading up 0.2%.\n\nAlibaba surges as \u2018Big Short\u2019 Burry increases stake\n\nBut Hong Kong shares of Alibaba Group (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) rose sharply, up 7% at a seven-month high, after an overnight filing showed an investment firm run by Michael Burry, of the \u201cBig Short\u201d fame, had increased its stake in the e-commerce giant.\n\nGains in Alibaba spilled over into other tech majors including Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and JD.com (HK:9618) (NASDAQ:JD). Burry was also seen increasing his stake in JD, which is now his biggest position.\n\nChinese tech major Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) rose nearly 4%, as it forecast increased demand from artificial intelligence even as its first quarter earnings underwhelmed.\n\nBroader Asian stocks drifted lower, reversing course from strong gains on Thursday as markets reassessed the outlook for U.S. interest rates.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 shed 0.4%, while the broader TOPIX rose 0.2%.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.6%, as concerns over China weighed on major mining and consumer stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI lost 0.8%, while futures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks dip as rate cut rally cools, China data underwhelms\n\nRBC: GrainCorp posts poor H1 2024 results, forecast remains resilient\n\nMicrosoft offers cloud customers AMD alternative to Nvidia AI processors\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Alibaba Group's (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) Hong Kong shares rallied to a seven-month high on Friday after Michael Burry\u2019s investment firm hiked its stake in the e-commerce giant and several of its Chinese peers.\n\nAlibaba surged over 7% to HK$85.80- its highest level since October 2023. The stock was the best performer on the Hang Seng index, which rose 0.9%.\n\nBurry\u2019s Scion Asset Management increased its stakes in Alibaba and peer JD.com (HK:9618) (NASDAQ:JD), with the latter becoming its biggest holding in the first quarter, a 13-F filing showed earlier this week. Scion increased its stake in JD by 80%.\n\nAlibaba was the fund\u2019s second-biggest holding, with Scion increasing its position in the ecommerce giant by 50,000 shares to 125,000 shares, worth around $9 million.\n\nBurry, who famously predicted and shorted the 2008 U.S. housing crisis, has been buying into heavily-discounted Chinese technology stocks over the past year, on bets that the sector will rebound tracking a broader post-COVID recovery in the Chinese economy.\n\nWhile Chinese stocks fizzled in 2023, Burry\u2019s bet now appears to be bearing fruit so far in 2024. Alibaba is trading up 14% so far in 2024, while JD.com is up 21%.\n\nThe gains came even as Alibaba disappointed with its first-quarter earnings. JD, however, beat expectations with its first quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\nStill, the broader Chinese stock market marked a strong rebound over the past two months, as global investors slowly warmed up to local stocks amid persistent government support.\n\nChina was also seen winding down a regulatory crusade against its internet giants over the past year, as Beijing looked to all avenues to boost growth.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAlibaba rallies to 7-mth high as \u2018Big Short\u2019 investor Burry increases stake\n\nMicrosoft offers cloud customers AMD alternative to Nvidia AI processors\n\nGoogle seeks non-jury trial in US ad tech lawsuit, filing says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire investor David Tepper loaded up on beaten-down Chinese stocks last quarter while reducing stakes in high-flying US tech firms, leading hedge fund managers who are slowly warming up to China amid a record gap in valuations between the two markets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Jamie Dimon Sees \u2018Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us\u2019 Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 Dow Average Is Trading Near Historic 40,000 Mark: Markets Wrap With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence\n\nTepper\u2019s Appaloosa Management more than doubled its investment in Alibaba Group Holdings in the first three months of the year, making the Chinese e-commerce giant the biggest position in its $6.7 billion equity portfolio, according to a regulatory filing. The fund also raised its stakes in PDD Holdings and Baidu Inc., while adding JD.com and two Chinese exchange-traded funds as new buys during the quarter.\n\nAs Tepper built up positions in Chinese stocks, he trimmed holdings in so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, including Amazon.com, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp. The result: Chinese shares and ETFs accounted for 24% of the fund\u2019s equity portfolio as of the end of the quarter.\n\nTepper is among global investors who are cautiously returning to Chinese stocks after a meltdown earlier this year sent their valuations to a record discount relative to their US peers. As a group, hedge funds lifted their holdings in Alibaba, PDD and Baidu during the quarter, while scaling back on companies including JD.com and two electronic vehicle makers \u2014 Nio Inc. and Li Auto, according to the quarterly filing data.\n\nTheir purchases were well-timed. The MSCI China Index has surged almost 30% since its January low, as state-backed funds stepped in to support the market and Beijing\u2019s economic stimulus started to gain traction.\n\nEven after the rebound, the China benchmark is still trading at less than half of the valuation of the S&P 500 Index, which notched a fresh record this week. As of mid-April, hedge funds\u2019 net allocations in China increased only slightly above their lowest levels in five years, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nMichael Burry Boosts Bets on China Big Tech as Stocks Rebound\n\nDruckenmiller, Tepper Cash Out Gains on \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 Jump\n\nJD Sales Quicken After Dangling Perks to Woo China Shoppers\n\nAmong bargain hunters in China, few hedge fund managers were more aggressive than Tepper. His investment in Alibaba was worth more than $800 million at the end of March, or 12% of his stock holdings, making him among the largest investors in the company. Appaloosa was also among the largest hedge fund investors in the $5.2 billion iShares China Large-cap ETF (FXI) and $6.4 billion KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund (KWEB).\n\nStory continues\n\nTepper didn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail by Bloomberg News seeking comment.\n\nChinese tech giants reported mixed earnings this week. While JD.com posted better-than-anticipated revenue increases and Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s net income surged, Alibaba and Baidu reported lackluster results.\n\nTepper, who founded Appaloosa Management in 1993, is worth about $20 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\n--With assistance from Amy Li and Amanda Cantrell.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink\u2019s First Patient: \u2018It Blows My Mind So Much\u2019 How the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives The DNA Test Delusion Europe\u2019s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do Milei Targets Labor Law That\u2019s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Below, let's dive into what's driving today's positive price action.\n\nAlibaba stockis brushing off three price-target cuts after the company reported an 86% drop in profits for the fiscal fourth quarter, while revenue beat estimates. The e-commerce name is re-investing in strategies that drive growth, however. Shares are today trading at their highest level and eyeing their biggest single-day percentage jump since November.\n\nMeanwhile, JD.Com beat first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations thanks to price cutsand discount coupons that boosted sales. The shares are still seeing overhead pressure at the $35 level, which capped a late-August rally, but earlier this week surged to levels not seen since September. JD also sports a 23.6% quarter-to-date lead.\n\nOptions traders are targeting both stocks, with 428,000 calls and 143,000 puts traded for BABA, and 80,000 calls and 44,000 puts for JD -- triple and double the intraday average volume for each stock, respectively. The May 85 call is most active for the former, with positions being opened there, and the 34 call in that series for the latter.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'Big Short' Investor Michael Burry Bets Heavy On Gold, Renewable Energy Stocks, Exits Amazon, Alphabet\n\nMichael Burry, the legendary investor who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis, has once again made headlines with his latest 13F filing for his hedge fund Scion Asset Management LLC.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 reveals a strategic recalibration towards physical commodities and renewable energy, while Burry shifted away from some tech giants.\n\nThe total market value of Scion's 13F securities increased from $94.6 million to $103.49 million. The fund\u2019s activity included five new purchases, additions to 11 existing positions, and complete sell-offs of 14 stocks.\n\nTop 5 Buys: A Golden Bet On Gold And Clean Energy\n\nBurry's top buys for Q1 2024 reveal a clear pivot towards physical precious metals and clean energy, underscoring his anticipation of rising value in these sectors.\n\nLeading the charge is the Sprott Physical Gold Trust ETV (NYSE:PHYS), with Scion increasing its position by $7.62 million, marking a 7.37% change in the portfolio. This substantial investment highlights Burry's confidence in gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty. The aforementioned gold fund has delivered a 16% return year to date, outperforming the broader stock market, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which rose by 12%.\n\nNext in line is Cigna Holding Co (NYSE:CL), where Scion increased its stake by $7.26 million, representing a 7.02% portfolio change. This move reflects Burry's continued belief in the resilience and growth potential of the healthcare sector.\n\nReflecting confidence in the energy sector, Burry added $6.59 million worth of BP Plc ADR (NYSE:BP), translating to a 6.37% portfolio change. This investment signifies Burry\u2019s recognition of BP\u2019s strong position in the global energy market, especially amid BP\u2019s transition to cleaner energy sources.\n\nLast week, the British energy company\u2019s electric vehicle charging unit announced plans to acquire Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) supercharging sites in the US as part of its expansion efforts.\n\nBurry's commitment to renewable energy is further emphasized by a $5.06 million increase in First Solar Inc. (NYSE:FSLR), representing a 4.89% change in the portfolio. This move aligns with the global shift towards sustainable energy solutions, showcasing Burry's foresight in capitalizing on this growing trend.\n\nRounding out the top five buys is Baidu Inc ADR (NASDAQ:BIDU), with a $4.38 million addition, marking a 4.07% portfolio change. This investment underscores Burry\u2019s confidence in the long-term potential of Chinese technology companies.\n\nIn his Q4 2023 13F filing, Burry increased stakes in two major Chinese retail giants, JD.com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba Group Holdings (NASDAQ:BABA).\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of the first quarter 2024, Burry further increased his stakes in these two giants, purchasing an additional 160,000 shares of JD.com and 50,000 shares of Alibaba.\n\nTop 5 Portfolio Divestments: Burry Trims Tech Giants\n\nBurry made notable divestments in several high-profile tech stocks during the first quart.\n\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ:ORCL) tops the list, with Scion decreasing its holdings by $5.77 million, a 5.57% change in the portfolio.\n\nCVS Health Corp (CVS) followed closely, with a $5.62 million reduction, a 5.43% change in the portfolio. This move might reflect concerns over potential challenges in the healthcare sector.\n\nNexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) ranked third in terms of largest sales, with Burry reducing the stake by $5.57 million (5.39% change).\n\nNotably, Burry opted to completely exit his positions in two major U.S. tech giants, suggesting a reevaluation of their growth prospects following a strong rally.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a full divestment, with Burry selling $5.35 million worth of shares (a 5.17% change).\n\nSimilarly,\u00a0Amazon.com\u00a0Inc. (AMZN) experienced a complete exit, with a $4.99 million reduction, representing a 4.82% portfolio change. This move highlights Burry's cautious stance on the future performance of one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms.\n\nPortfolio Summary\n\nThe top five holdings by weight in the Scion Asset Management LLC\u2019s portfolio by the end of the Q1 2024 are:\n\nJD.com Inc: 9.53%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd: by 8.74%. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA): 8.06%. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C): 7.64%.

One, he\u2019s revealed his Q1\u20192024 portfolio, which include some surprising moves which show Burry is once again swimming against the tide (more on that later). Second, amid the return of Roaring Kitty on Twitter, meme stock boys on Reddit and Twitter are recalling how Burry was the first notable investor who started piling into GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), long before it became famous due to the historic meme stock rally and short squeeze episodes of 2021. Michael Burry, in the fourth quarter of 2018, bought a $6.8 million position in GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME). Over the next few quarters he bought and sold the stock, following the classic Burry playbook, before liquidating his entire stake in the company in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nBurry rose to limelight after accurately predicting the 2008 US housing crash, but over the past several years his persistent warnings about recessions and market crashes have turned out to be wrong. After betting against the broader semiconductor industry, Burry closed his short position in iShares Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker SOXX) in the last quarter of 2023. He also closed his bets against the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFilings for the first quarter of 2024 show Burry was busy buying many new stocks. In this article we will take a look at some important stocks that account for about 42% of Burry's Q1 portfolio, which was worth about $103 million as of the end of March 2024.\n\nTo see more important stocks in Burry's portfolio, click 8 Stocks Michael Burry Has Invested 55% of His Portfolio In.

As of early March, the company was 70% done with its business exits and had reduced management layers by 1/4th. We have high confidence Citi will hit its targets.

Hospital stocks tend to be much more volatile than their actual intrinsic value, and we would gladly purchase HCA again if the discount to value warrants.\u201d\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nMichael Burry's Q1'2024 Stake: $9,045,000\n\nPercentage of Burry's Portfolio: 8.74%\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the top stock picks of Michael Burry in 2024. He\u2019s been increasing his hold in the\u00a0 Chinese e-commerce giant since the third quarter of 2023, when he bought 50,000 shares in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). In the fourth quarter, Burry added to his position in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), ending the year with 75,000 shares of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). In the March quarter, Burry again piled into the stock, increasing his position in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) by 67%.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) shares have gained about 8% so far this year. Baird recently said that it\u2019s seeing some \"early momentum\" in Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA)\u00a0as Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA)\u00a0focuses more on customers and Cloud growth.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPretty much all of our holdings rose during the quarter. Only one stock declined by more than a couple of percent\u2014Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), which was down 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. This investment continues to be a disappointment. We estimate the shares are trading at around 5X EBITA\u2014a valuation normally reserved for a company with evaporating profits. While it\u2019s true Alibaba is underperforming its peers in the market, the fact is it remains the market leader in its core businesses, and the business is still growing. In the most recent quarter, revenues grew 9% and profits grew 26%.It\u2019s not evaporating.\n\nThe management seems to be making meaningful changes designed to enhance shareholder value, including structural changes to improve profitability and restore its competitive position. It is monetizing non-core assets and making improvements in capital allocation. A lot of good things are happening that are not yet recognized in the share price. There are reasons\u2014primarily geopolitical\u2014for this, but at the current valuation, we could easily see the shares double and they would still be cheap.\u201d\n\nJD.Com Inc (NASDAQ:JD)\n\nMichael Burry's Q1'2024 Stake: $9,860,400\n\nPercentage of Burry's Portfolio: 9.52%\n\nWhile everyone (including Warren Buffett) in the US is fleeing Chinese stocks amid geopolitical uncertainty and US government\u2019s new tariffs, Burry is piling into some of the biggest Chinese stocks, cementing his status as a contrarian investor and true maverick. Scion Asset Management increased its stake in the Chinese ecommerce company by 80% in the first quarter, ending the period with a $9.8 million stake. JD.Com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) shares have gained about 23% year to date through May 16.\n\nThese were just 5 stocks in Burry's portfolio.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 8 Other Stocks Michael Burry Has 50% of His Portfolio Invested In.\n\nDisclosure: None\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. reported a 7% rise in revenue after it slashed prices and ramped up shopper perks to counter fierce market competition and a Chinese downturn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt Xi Tells Putin China-Russia Ties Should Last \u2018Generations\u2019 US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market\n\nThe Beijing-based retailer said its sales increased to about 260.1 billion yuan ($36 billion) in the March quarter, compared to the average analyst projection for about 258.4 billion yuan. That topline growth accelerated from 3.6% in the previous quarter. Net income rose 13.9% to 7.1 billion yuan.\n\nJD.com\u2019s results are seen as one of the key bellwethers of Chinese consumption, which has struggled to recover since the country lifted nearly three years of Covid curbs. While Chief Executive Officer Sandy Xu predicted that Beijing\u2019s policies would shore up consumer confidence, growth in retail sales slumped in March and industrial output fell short of forecasts, in warning signs for the economy\u2019s recovery this year.\n\nThe company in recent months has turned to a discount spree and other perks to fend off stiff competition in China from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as well as up-and-comers like PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd. JD nearly doubled salaries to some front-line staff and offered 1 billion yuan in subsidies and rewards to video content creators on its platform. It even trotted out a digital avatar of its billionaire co-founder Richard Liu, hoping his name would juice sales ahead of the June 18 festival, China\u2019s second largest online shopping event.\n\nJD also intensified efforts to expand internationally as domestic consumer sentiment has remained sluggish \u2014 including weighing and then scrapping an offer to buy British electronics retailer Currys Plc. It touted its efforts in artificial intelligence with its own proprietary large language model, while following Alibaba with aggressive price reductions for cloud computing services.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nJD.com\u2019s 1Q retail-operating margin probably fell year on year for the second straight quarter. Revenue gain may have trailed cost hikes from new perks to merchants and users, such as free delivery services, as well as higher staff salaries amid intense rivalry from Alibaba, Douyin and other retailers. The firm likely incurred more expenses after offering free delivery services to a wider spectrum of third-party merchants and lowering the minimum value of on-demand orders which are entitled to this incentive. JD.com\u2019s new free-returns service in 1Q may have also raised costs.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Catherine Lim, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nAs with other Chinese tech firms, JD has stepped up its share repurchase program, It plans to buy back up to $3 billion worth of shares through March 2027. The company\u2019s repurchases jumped sixfold in the first quarter, raising the likelihood of further buybacks this year, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives The DNA Test Delusion Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Europe\u2019s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do Silicon Valley Is Searching for Its Piece of the AI Action\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Overlooked Chinese Stocks Poised for a Massive Comeback",
        "content": "Chinese stocks have been some of the most battered in the\u00a0entire\u00a0world. However, things are finally turning around for the Chinese economy and\u00a0the stock market as well.\u00a0The storm clouds\u00a0looming over the Chinese market seem to dissipate, and a new dawn could be on the horizon.\n\nThe Chinese government has taken steps to prop up stocks in the past few months, and\u00a0I believe\u00a0if the Chinese stock market starts to falter again, they will loosen policy even more, considering China has minimal inflation.\u00a0With the world\u2019s largest\u00a0foreign exchange reserve at $3.2 trillion, China has the ammunition to stabilize its currency if it decides to induce more quantitative easing. This financial firepower could prove to be a game-changer for the Chinese market.\n\nGiven the potential for a turnaround, buying up some promising Chinese stocks for cheap before they fully rebound like many Western stocks did after the 2022 downturn makes sense. Here are three Chinese stocks to look into:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) has sadly disappointed again this earnings season. It beat revenue estimates by nearly 1% but missed EPS estimates. It earned 10.14 renminbi vs. 10.71 expected per ADS, which led to the stock slumping by 6%.\u00a0However, this miss\u00a0does not bother\u00a0me about the company\u2019s long-term outlook. It is much more than just e-commerce nowadays. BABA segments. Chinese stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith a stunning 45% surge in international commerce revenue and triple-digit increases in AI-related sales, it\u2019s\u00a0obvious\u00a0that Alibaba\u2019s strategic adjustments are paying off.\u00a0The company\u00a0slashing cloud prices to ignite growth\u00a0might have been\u00a0one of the main culprits behind the missed earnings, but\u00a0I think\u00a0growth is what Alibaba needs right now.\u00a0It trades at 15 times trailing earnings and has a 1.26% dividend yield. Profits are not\u00a0a problem here and should grow in the long run if the top line does.\n\nHowever, the real showstopper is the\u00a0strong\u00a0double-digit growth in GMV for Taobao and Tmall. They\u2019ve rebuilt consumer trust and frequency of purchases.\u00a0This\u00a0bodes well for their fiscal 2025 targets, where monetization aligned with platform improvements should further advance revenue gains.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu\u2019s (NASDAQ:BIDU) Q1 earnings are due on Thursday, so it is impossible to judge near-term moves. However, the long-term here is\u00a0definitely\u00a0positive. In Q4 2023, revenue growth remained modest at 1.16% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, the monetization of Baidu\u2019s ERNIE model is rapidly gaining traction. In Q4 alone, the company generated \u201cseveral hundred million RMB\u201d from ERNIE-powered ad tech improvements and enterprise model building.\n\nThis incremental ERNIE revenue stream could swell into the billions in 2024. Fueled by advertising and cloud AI services, leadership\u2019s guidance aligns with Baidu\u2019s desire to make ERNIE a foundational system that enables an ecosystem of third-party AI applications.\n\nI do not think\u00a0China will\u00a0use\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0or Western AI models anytime soon.\u00a0This\u00a0is an up-and-coming AI company with a massive captive user base it can dominate in the coming years\u2014dirt cheap at 14 times earnings. EPS is expected to rise significantly in the future. BIDU EPS. Chinese stocks\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nMeituan (MPNGF) Meituan food delivery on motorbike in Zhongshan China.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeituan\u2019s (OTCMKTS:MPNGY, OTCMKTS:MPNGF) earnings for this season will also\u00a0be released\u00a0about a week from now. You may know Alibaba and Baidu, but Meituan is only well-known in China.\u00a0This\u00a0is a shopping platform for locally found consumer products and retail services.\n\nIts most recent business updates showed that\u00a0food orders surged almost 24% YOY, and shopping orders through the Meituan Instashopping service rose over 40%.\n\nHowever, I\u00a0wouldn\u2019t overlook\u00a0the significant 30% growth in customers who used their services frequently across all platform parts.\u00a0This large group of loyal users who order often and spend good money could\u00a0really\u00a0drive continuous expansion.\n\nTo be sure, the stock\u00a0isn\u2019t cheap\u00a0compared to other Chinese stocks.\u00a0However,\u00a0the higher price reflects reasonable expectations for a business modernizing convenient shopping so aggressively.

        "content": "Chinese video gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings launched an upgraded version of its large language model (LLM) with text-to-image generation that is open source for enterprises and individuals.\n\nThe eight-month-old Hunyuan large language foundation model developed by Tencent underwent a major upgrade earlier this year, which enhanced its overall performance by 20 per cent compared with the previous version, according to a statement posted on Tuesday on the official WeChat account of Tencent Cloud, the company's cloud-computing services arm.\n\nTencent said the latest text-to-image function employs the DiT model architecture, which is also used by OpenAI's text-to-video tool Sora. The company added that its primary database is in Chinese, enabling the tool to effectively and accurately understand Chinese-language commands.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe complete source code of its text-to-image LLM has been released on US open-source platforms Hugging Face and Github \"to benefit the industry as a whole and build an open source ecosystem for next-generation vision generation\", according to the statement.\n\nThat means both individuals and enterprises can access the program's code and modify or share its design, fix broken links, or scale up its capabilities.\n\nSince launching Hunyuan last September, Tencent has integrated its LLM into the company's various business units, including Tencent Cloud, Tencent Games and super app WeChat. The company said the AI-powered tool has also been provided to over 20 media outlets and advertising firms to facilitate their work.\n\nThe launch of the upgraded version came a day after Microsoft-backed OpenAI unveiled its newest GPT model, GPT-4o, which is capable of natural human-computer interaction across text, image, video, and audio.\n\nOpen-source technologies have played an important role in facilitating China's ability to improve its LLMs and catch up with OpenAI's innovative generative AI tools.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post, has also taken an aggressive move to give third-party developers access to its models after the e-commerce giant launched its self-developed Tongyi Qianwen, or Qwen, LLM last year.\n\nTencent launched its Hunyuan AI model during the Global Digital Ecosystem Summit in Shenzhen, September 7, 2023: Photo: Handout alt=Tencent launched its Hunyuan AI model during the Global Digital Ecosystem Summit in Shenzhen, September 7, 2023: Photo: Handout>\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba Cloud, the company's cloud-computing unit, has provided access to 76 Qwen text generation models on ModelScope and Hugging Face.\n\nIt includes the 72-billion-parameter and 1.8-billion-parameter versions of its LLM. It also freely made available another model that understands audio.\n\nBoth Tencent and Alibaba reported better-than-expected profits in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nShenzhen-based Tencent reported a 62 per cent jump to 41.9 billion yuan (US$5.8 billion) in the first quarter, fuelled by strong advertising revenue, marking its first quarterly profit growth since last June.\n\nAlibaba reported a 10 per cent increase in profit to 79.7 billion yuan in the financial year through to the end of March, marking its most profitable year since 2021.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Segantii Capital Management Ltd.\u2019s top holding of US securities at the end of March was a $395 million bearish wager on an exchange-traded fund linked to the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market\n\nThe put options were placed on an Invesco Ltd. ETF that tracks the largest 100 non-financial companies by market value, including Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. The ETF gained 8.4% during the quarter and has risen another 2% since March 28.\n\nSegantii, which is facing charges of insider trading in Hong Kong, had its second-largest 13F holding by value in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The position stood at nearly $108 million, after the firm boosted the number of American depository receipts of the Chinese technology giant it owned by 50%. Alibaba fell 6.6% in the US in the first quarter, but has rebounded 12% since then.\n\nThe hedge fund firm\u2019s total exposure to US securities stood at $1.5 billion at the end of March, down 20% from the previous quarter-end, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on 13F filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. That move extended the decline from the one-year peak on Sept. 30 to 46%.\n\nKurt Ersoy, Segantii\u2019s chief executive officer, declined to comment.\n\nThe quarterly 13F filings provide a snapshot of a firms\u2019 ownership of securities on an SEC mandatory disclosure list at the end of the quarter. They typically don\u2019t shed light on bearish wagers on stocks. The filings also don\u2019t capture bullish or bearish wagers on non-US-listed securities. Nor do they account for trading during the quarter.\n\nSegantii, best known for its relative value and capital markets trades, manages a hedge fund that focuses on Asia-Pacific equities and equity-linked securities but can also trade globally. Its founder Simon Sadler has built a reputation as Asia\u2019s \u201cblock-trade king.\u201d\n\nBesides Hong Kong, it also has offices in London, New York and Dubai. It returned an annualized 12% since its December 2007 inception, more than twice a Eurekahedge index of Asian peers. With two small annual losses so far, it was one of the most consistent performers among regional hedge funds.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission earlier this month announced criminal proceedings against Segantii, Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca over alleged insider trading. While the firm has said it intends to \u201cdefend itself vigorously,\u201d the move by the watchdog marks one of the most high-profile prosecutions in the Asian financial hub.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe summons was issued in March, the Financial Times reported on May 3. The prosecution is building up to be one of the highest-profile hedge fund trials in years, casting a shadow over the 16-year-old firm which oversaw $4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\nIts hedge fund was up about 0.3% in April, after a 2.5% gain in the same period, according to a preliminary estimate.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the market value of Segantii\u2019s 13F holdings to swing from quarter to quarter. It declared $2.84 billion of such holdings at the end of March 2023, only to see it tumble by nearly 33% three months later, before climbing back to nearly $2.85 billion the following quarter-end. Its latest filing includes 100 positions, the fewest in the last five quarters and less than one-third of the March 2023 level.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives The DNA Test Delusion Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Europe\u2019s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do Neuralink\u2019s First Patient: \u2018It Blows My Mind So Much\u2019\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The wagers appear to be paying off, as Chinese policymakers\u2019 efforts to stem a rout and signs of improvement in earnings spur a rebound in the troubled market. JD.com\u2019s US-listed shares have climbed more than 16% this year while Alibaba\u2019s have increased about 4.5%.\n\nBaidu Inc.\u2019s American Depositary Receipts, which Burry added a small $4.2 million stake, are still down 7% this year.\n\nGlobal investors have been making a cautious return to the Chinese stock market as cheap valuations and Beijing\u2019s policy support allowed a number of equity benchmarks to roar into bull markets.

The figure decreased 5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number in RMB terms.\r\n\r\nRevenues of RMB 221.87 billion ($30.73 billion) rose 7% from the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.59 billion.\r\n\r\nThe top-line increase was driven by solid momentum across the international commerce retail and wholesale businesses. Strength across the local services and Cainiao logistics services contributed well. The improving performance of the Taobao and Tmall Group segment was a positive.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sluggish performance of the Digital Media and Entertainment Group was concerning.\r\n\r\nShares of Alibaba have returned 2.6% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s growth of 10%.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nRevenues by Segments\n\nTaobao and Tmall Group (42% of the total revenues): The segment comprises Taobao, Tmall, Xianyu, 1688.com and other businesses operating in China\u2019s retail and wholesale markets.

The improvement was attributed to customer management revenues, which grew 5% year over year, driven by strength in search and recommendations. Also, growing online GMV on Taobao and Tmall was a positive.\r\n\r\nHowever, revenues from direct sales and others declined 2% year over year, which was a negative.\r\n\r\nChina commerce wholesale (5.3%): The business generated revenues of RMB 4.95 billion ($686 million), which grew 20% on a year-over-year basis. This was attributed to increasing revenues from value-added services.\r\n\r\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (12.4% of the total revenues): The segment comprises Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Alibaba.com, and other businesses operating in the international retail and wholesale markets. Alibaba generated RMB 27.45 billion ($3.8 billion) in revenues from the segment, which grew 45% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nInternational commerce retail (81.2% of international revenues): Revenues for the reported quarter were RMB 22.3 billion ($3.1 billion), up 56% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure, owing to solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses. Also, the strong momentum in AliExpress\u2019 Choice was a positive.\r\n\r\nInternational commerce wholesale (18.8%): The business generated revenues of RMB 5.2 billion ($716 million), which increased 11% on a year-over-year basis. Strength in cross-border-related value-added services contributed well.\r\n\r\nLocal Services Group (6.6% of the total revenues): The segment\u2019s revenues grossed RMB 14.63 billion ($2.03 billion), up 19% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was driven by strong order growth in the Ele.me and Amap businesses.\r\n\r\nCainiao Smart Logistics Network (11.1% of the total revenues): Revenues summed up to RMB 24.6 billion ($3.4 billion), up 30% from the year-ago quarter. The upside was led by a solid momentum across cross-border fulfillment solutions.\r\n\r\nCloud Intelligence Group (11.5% of the total revenues): The segment generated revenues of RMB 25.6 billion ($3.5 billion), up 3% from the year-ago quarter. This was attributed to strength across Alibaba\u2019s consolidated businesses.\r\n\r\nDigital Media and Entertainment Group (2.2% of the total revenues): Revenues logged RMB 4.95 billion ($685 million), decreasing 1% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nAll Others (23.2% of the total revenues): The segment\u2019s revenues were RMB 51.5 billion ($7.1 billion), down 3% from the year-ago quarter.

        "content": "Tanking Profit Overshadowed Alibaba's AI Growth And Reignited Domestic E-Commerce\n\nOn Tuesday, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) reported its net profit took quite a dive during the fiscal fourth quarter, after already having a hard time throughout 2023 as it underwent its largest-ever corporate restructuring.\n\nFourth Fiscal Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, Alibaba posted revenue\u00a0grew 7% YoY to\u00a0221.9 billion yuan, which amounts\u00a0$30.7 billion, as it boosted domestic e-commerce sales.\u00a0But, Alibaba reported its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders\u00a0tanked as much as\u00a086%\u00a0YoY to\u00a03.27\u00a0billion yuan, which is about\u00a0$452 million, attributing the poor result to\u00a0a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies, compared to last year\u2019s quarter when it made a net gain.\n\nEarly signs of reignited e-commerce growth.\n\nAlthough Alibaba is still grappling with cautious consumers in China amid the economic slowdown, its core e-commerce business has improved due to its focus on low-cost goods.\u00a0Taobao and Tmall division\u00a0that represent its e-commerce segment reported 4% YoY growth to\u00a093.2 billion yuan, accelerating from previous quarter\u2019s\u00a02% growth.\n\nCustomer management revenue\u00a0which consists of\u00a0sales received from services such as marketing\u00a0that merchants get from Alibaba, reported\u00a05%\u00a0YoY growth, also improving from being flat in the previous quarter. International commerce business\u00a0grew\u00a045%\u00a0YoY\u00a027.4 billion yuan.\n\nCloud growth fails to impress, but AI rose to the task.\n\nThe cloud computing division is having a hard time to shine. Last year, Alibaba decided\u00a0not proceed with the spinoff\u00a0of the division that competes with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud. For the reported quarter, Cloud computing brought in\u00a025.6 billion yuan\u00a0to the revenue table, posting the same growth rate of\u00a03%\u00a0YoY from the previous quarter.\n\nHowever,\u00a0AI-related revenue\u00a0reported a\u00a0triple-digit\u00a0YoY\u00a0growth.\u00a0AI-revenue came from\u00a0various sectors, including\u00a0foundational model companies, internet companies,\u00a0financial services and\u00a0the\u00a0automotive industry.\n\nA Big Week For Global AI Development\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched its new AI model, GPT-4o. Through a livestreamed event, Microsoft-backed OpenAI demonstrated its latest effort of expanding the use of its chatbot and improving its capabilities as it made a significant step when it comes to ease of use. Microsoft-backed Open AI demonstrated the capabilities of the new model that is able to even perceive the user\u2019s emotion,\u00a0help calm a user down before making a public speech as well as read a story in a different tone or even\u00a0sing it. OpenAI also touted the fact the new model can act as a translator even in audio mode. Moreover, by solving\u00a0math equations and helping to\u00a0write codes, GPT-4o\u00a0\u00a0is a strong contender to\u00a0Microsoft-made\u00a0GitHub Copilot.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, Alibaba did report its profit plummeted, but its core business as well as the promising AI segment are growing, both of which are the main heroes of its storyline and future prospects.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Chinese Stocks with Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "While the world\u2019s second-largest economy is full of economic dynamism, it has also a place full of risks. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, large Chinese technology firms were placed under heavy regulatory scrutiny after the Chinese government decided they were becoming too large and influential. Then came China\u2019s housing bubble, which has not only dampened real estate prices across the country but has also stifled the country\u2019s economic comeback from COVID-19.\n\nThese are just a couple of the main reasons Chinese stocks have underperformed their peers. Months, and in some cases, years of underperformance have led to a sharp collapse in Chinese equities valuations, which could provide opportunities for investors who like to think long-term or exploit a crisis.\n\nWall Street is also quite optimistic about many Chinese stocks. Below are three of them boasting \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nSay what you want, China\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d has created advantages for the country in the long run. Instead of relying on American tech companies for a search engine or social media, Chinese tech firms have built similar products and, in turn, have created a durable tech ecosystem. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a key part of China\u2019s tech ecosystem. From search to cloud computing services and autonomous driving, Baidu\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d business neatly encapsulates all of these services. Moreover, iQIYI has morphed into a very popular streaming platform in China.\n\nBaidu\u2019s recent achievement in autonomous driving is connected to a story with electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). CEO Elon Musk took a trip to China in late April, and he came back with tentative government approval for his EV company\u2019s autonomous driving system. Tesla will be rolling out this autonomous system\u2019s functionality with the help of Baidu. More concretely, Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving system will leverage a key product of the Chinese tech giant: Baidu Maps.\n\nBaidu\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings report also contained glimmers of hope. While the company\u2019s advertising revenue has dipped due to turmoil within China\u2019s economy and weak consumer confidence, Baidu\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) investments are paying off. Baidu reported its cloud business, which now includes AI chatbot Ernie-related services experienced upper-single-digit growth.\n\nTrading at only 10.2x forward earnings and having garnered several \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings from Wall Street firms, Baidu just looks like a steal right now.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nStory continues\n\nChina\u2019s household technology giants were in the spotlight for many years prior to the pandemic, but regulatory crackdowns have hampered those sentiments. Nowadays, electric vehicle and battery maker BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) has gained a lot of attention. While BYD did start as a battery maker selling lithium-ion batteries for consumer electronics products, the company transformed into an EV behemoth. Towards the end of 2023, BYD was able to surpass its key rival Tesla in deliveries.\n\nMoreover, in spite of a slowdown in China\u2019s economy, electric vehicles remain a bright spot. In the first quarter of 2024, BYD along with many of its EV peers were able to deliver solid double-digit sales and delivery growth. Unfortunately, the hyper-competitive environment in China\u2019s EV space caused BYD to suffer on revenue growth and margins in Q1. However, BYD\u2019s relatively low valuation coupled with its efforts to expand in Southeast Asia and the Middle East will provide secular tailwinds for years to come.\n\nCurrently, BYD boasts a resounding \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating from several Wall Street firms.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), which is the owner of e-commerce platforms Pinduoduo and Temu, makes the last entry on this list. The e-commerce platform has made a lot of headlines in recent months as it continues to siphon market share away from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Pinduoduo competes directly with Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce division and allows consumers to purchase a variety of consumer products as well as agricultural produce on the platform. Temu is a discount online retailer that allows consumers to buy products and have them directly shipped from China. This platform has a growing presence across the United States, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nPDD\u2019s low-cost services have helped it during a time of an economic slowdown in China. For the holding company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report for 2023, revenue more than doubled, increasing 123% on a year-over-year basis. Similarly, net income skyrocketed 143%.\n\nStrength in the company\u2019s geographically end-markets will help drive the company\u2019s growth in the future. Out of the 43 Wall Street analysts covering PDD, 8 have given it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating while 34 have given it a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and one analyst rated PDD as a \u201cHold.\u201d\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Over the past year Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock lost one-third of its value but in recent weeks is running hot again. Shares are up 26% from their 52-week low.\n\nAlthough the Chinese e-commerce giant remains over 60% below its all-time high hit back in 2021, is this the inflection point investors have been waiting for? There is good reason to believe it is. Let\u2019s dig in to find out why.\n\nToo Many Distractions\n\nAlibaba took its eye off the ball. It tried to be all things to all people. Beyond just its e-commerce platform, the company founded by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma put its finger into numerous pies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt operates a cloud computing business similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) web Serivces. Alibaba Health is a digital health care and pharmaceutical company.\n\nIt developed an launched an intelligent personal assistant, AliGenie, similar to Alexa. Cainiao is Alibaba\u2019s logistics arms. It also operates DAMO Academy, a research and development institute.\n\nTo say the least, Alibaba has a lot of balls to keep up in the air while juggling intense competition in online shopping.\n\nAnd that was likely its biggest failing. By not focusing on its core business, Alibaba allowed competitors like PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu and Pinduoduo to steal market share. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has also proved to be a more nimble competitor.\n\nFocusing on What Is Important\n\nAlibaba now has a new management team in place that is focused on fighting back to regain momentum and market share. It is placing renewed emphasis on its flagship Taobao and Tmall apps with greater attention being placed on Chinese consumers (Alibaba also operates several marketplaces in international markets).\n\nPart of that effort, according to chairman Joe Tsai, is a recently created capital management committee dedicated to divesting noncore assets, including several Alibaba\u2019s physical retail businesses.\n\nAccording to Tsai, as of February, the e-commerce giant has already \u201cexited $1.7 billion in noncore investments.\u201d\n\nManagement is also attempting to restore value to shareholders by increasing its stock buyback program by $25 billion.\n\nGreenshoots Are Appearing\n\nThe results are beginning to gain traction. Although there remains a lot of work to accomplish yet, Alibaba is seeing growth where it counts.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Ronald Keung says domestic parcel volumes jumped over 20% in April compared to a year ago and surged over 30% over China\u2019s Labor Day holiday that began May 1. He says sales at both Taobao and Tmall were running far ahead of the national average.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt will not show up right away in Alibaba\u2019s financials, but investors can expect to see more of it in the back half of 2024.\n\nWall Street is becoming more upbeat about China stocks in general and Alibaba in particular. UBS analysts lifted the largest stocks in the sector to \u201coverweight\u201d because the fundamentals and earnings of the businesses remain solid despite concerns over real estate and macroeconomic concerns in the country.\n\nThe stocks in the space also have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the government investing in those businesses to help stabilize the stock market.\n\nSupport From All Sides\n\nBrendan Ahern, chief investment officer for the KraneShares investment management firm, says China\u2019s stock market doesn\u2019t have \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d similar to U.S. markets that halt trading during excess volatility.\n\nAs a result, the government acts as a buyer of last resort. Recently the government has been buying up shares of mainland stocks, particularly megacap companies.\n\nThis is providing a floor of support to stocks like Alibaba, and likely helps account for the turnaround in its shares since mid-April. The stock is up almost 20% over the past month.\n\nImproved fundamentals, a renewed focus on its core business, growing sales and government support suggest Alibaba stock is ready to move higher. While it has made strong gains in just a short amount of time, there is plenty of runway for future growth.\n\nThe stock trades at 15 times trailing earnings, just 10 times estimates and Wall Street sees BABA stock growing profits 10% annually for the next five years.\n\nAlibaba is a discounted stock ready to rise. It\u2019s the inflection point investors were waiting for.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding on Tuesday posted a greater-than-expected decline in profit for the fourth quarter due to its equity investments, sending its stock price plunging in New York.\n\nIts net income for the quarter ended March was 3.3 billion yuan ($453 million), down 86% compared to the same time last year and missing analyst estimates. Alibaba said this was primarily due to a lower market value of its equity investments.\n\nRevenue however beat estimates and was up 7% to 221.8 billion yuan ($30.73 billion), as the company in recent months refocused its efforts to grow its e-commerce business amid growing competition from rivals such as Pinduoduo and Douyin as well as a slowing Chinese economy.\n\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Alibaba CEO, in an earnings call.\n\nQuarterly revenue for its e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall grew 4% compared to the same time last year.\n\nRevenue for its cloud unit rose by double-digits year over year, with artificial intelligence-related revenue from external customers growing at triple digits, the company said. It did not provide detailed figures for its cloud business.\n\nAlibaba also said Tuesday that it aimed to convert its secondary listing in Hong Kong to a primary listing by the end of August this year.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares declined over 7% in New York Tuesday following the results.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s stock price has fallen over 70% from its peak in October 2020. The Hangzhou-based e-commerce firm has grappled with investor confidence in recent years, following a regulatory crackdown in the technology industry and rising competition in the e-commerce industry.\n\nThe company last year underwent a major restructuring and split its businesses into six units, with the aim of maximizing shareholder value. The units would be able to raise their own capital and eventually go public.\n\nHowever, plans to take Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm and cloud business were eventually scrapped amid what Alibaba said were \u201cchallenging IPO market conditions.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. reported a 6.6% rise in revenue after its main e-commerce and cloud businesses managed only modest growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts Five Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy\n\nRevenue for the three months ended March rose to 221.9 billion yuan ($30.7 billion), compared with analysts\u2019 estimates for 219.8 billion yuan. Net income dived a worse-than-expected 86% after accounting for losses from publicly traded holdings. Its shares slid about 4% in pre-market trading.\n\nInvestors are closely watching results from Alibaba, a barometer of Chinese consumer sentiment, amid persistent worries about a loss of business to rivals from PDD Holdings Inc. to ByteDance Ltd. The choppy economic recovery is also roiling the company as it tries to revive growth after a years-long regulatory crackdown that kneecapped China\u2019s private sector.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company announced a $4 billion dividend for the fiscal year. Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. both reported results on Tuesday, offering clues to whether the Hong Kong equity rally has legs. Alibaba, which owns slices of public companies including SenseTime Group Inc. and Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., didn\u2019t disclose which specific losses hammered net income, which came in well below expectations. Its main Chinese commerce division managed just 4% revenue growth, while the cloud arm grew 3%.\n\nAlibaba Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu and Chairman Joe Tsai, longtime lieutenants of Jack Ma who took the helm from Daniel Zhang in September, are spearheading a turnaround of the e-commerce pioneer. They nixed major initiatives conceived under Zhang including listings logistics arm Cainiao and the $11 billion cloud unit, then decided to refocus on what they dubbed the customer experience and innovation.\n\nWu took the helm after a period of unprecedented turmoil at Alibaba, which contended with Covid, Beijing\u2019s internet crackdown and then a Chinese economic downturn in rapid succession.\n\nMa weighed in on Alibaba\u2019s turbulence last month, with a rare memo aimed at shoring up sagging morale among the company\u2019s 200,000-plus employees. He emphasized that growth was returning at the company, despite its recent flip-flops, while acknowledging past mistakes.\n\nWu this year took direct charge of the company\u2019s e-commerce and cloud services arm, both under pressure after a series of mis-steps and regulatory scrutiny. It\u2019s tried to enhance customer service, beef up its product lineup and introduced features such as easy returns. On the cloud front, the once-promising division is slashing prices to regain clients from state-backed companies such as China Telecom Corp. and the likes of Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nStory continues\n\nAway from the business, it\u2019s hiving off non-core assets like stakes in streaming platform Bilibili and electric-vehicle maker XPeng Inc. to raise capital. It\u2019s then funneled some of that cash into AI research and fast-growing startups like MiniMax.\n\n(Updates with shares from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges How the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Asian Stocks Set to Ride the Region\u2019s Boom to New Heights",
        "content": "Wall Street investors have been paying close attention to the growth in Asia. In 2023, despite various challenges in the region, especially in China\u2019s real estate sector, stocks in a number of countries saw double-digit returns. The high-performing stocks came esepcially from Taiwan, Japan, India, South Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Therefore, in this article, we spotlight three Asian stocks to buy in May.\n\nLooking at global growth numbers, we note that by 2030, Asia is expected to contribute well over 55% of the global gross domestic product (GDP). Research suggests that the region\u2019s growth trajectory is driven by a combination of factors, including urbanization, technological advancements, and government support for entrepreneurship and innovation. Against this backdrop, many investors are increasingly turning their attention to Asian stocks to buy, which may offer a unique blend of growth, value, and diversification benefits. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nJapan-based Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), our first pick among Asian stocks to buy, is a titan in the region\u2019s automotive sector. As a result, TM stock offers a compelling mix of brand strength, geographic reach, and robust financial standing. Some investors have concerned about the company being a late comer in the rush towards electric vehicles (EVs) compared to some rivals. Yet, the company\u2019s recent focus on hybrid technology and its \u201cmulti-pathway\u201d approach to electrification shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Asian automotive giant announced the financial results for fiscal year 2024 on 8 May. Full year revenue of 45 trillion Japanese yens (JPY) was up 21.4% compared to 37 trillion JPY for fiscal year 2023. In addition, earnings per diluted share almost doubled. Investors noted the strong financial fundamentals, solid balance sheet, and efficient cash flow management.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts point out Toyota\u2019s management is investing in software-defined vehicles, generative AI, and electrification, including battery EVs and plug-in hybrids. The Japanese auto giant is also enhancing hydrogen mobility solutions, positioning itself at forefront of innovative automotive technologies.\n\nTM stock has returned about 19% year-to-date (YTD) and the dividend yield is a strong 2.1%. The shares are trading favorably at 9.25 times trailing earnings and 1 times sales. Wall Street remains bullish on TM shares while the 12 month median price forecast for TM stock stands at $246.56. Such an upward move in Toyota shares would mean an upside potential of over 12% from current prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nYum China (YUMC) YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up on our list of Asian stocks to buy is Yum China (NYSE:YUMC). The company operates popular restaurant chains like KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell across mainland China. Wall Street notes that Yum China has not only capitalized on the interest in Western fast-food concepts in Asia but has also tailored its offerings to mesh seamlessly with local food tastes and preferences. This established player in Asian stocks boasts a strong track record of growth and offers a dividend for income-oriented investors.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 was particularly strong for Yum China, with system sales growing by 6% year-over-year (YOY), building on a 17% growth from the previous year. Revenue for the quarter reached a record $3 billion, and the core operating profit grew by 1% to $396 million. Earnings per diluted share also increased 4% YOY to 71 cents.\n\nAt present, the company has over 20,000 stores across mainland China. Looking ahead, Yum China aims to expand its footprint by another 20,000 in the next two years. Management is expected to focus more on lower-tier cities, which benefit from affordability of housing and living costs. Moreover, the rapid development of new shopping malls and commercial developments across China may provide fertile ground for new restaurant openings.\n\nHowever, despite the significant growth drivers China offers, so far in 2024, YUMC stock has declined over 11%. We should remind readers that the current dividend yield is 1.7%. Meanwhile, Yum China shares are changing hands at 18.9 times trailing earnings and 1.4 times sales. Finally, the 12-month median price forecast is at $53.60 suggesting an upside potential of\u00a0 over 40%.\n\nSPDR S&P Emerging Asia Pacific ETF (GMF) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nThe Asian region is a hub for numerous global economic powerhouses, including some of the fastest-growing economies worldwide. Our next pick of among Asian stocks is an exchange-traded fund, namely the SPDR S&P Emerging Asia Pacific ETF (NYSEARCA:GMF). This fund offers investors a strategic entry into this dynamic market without having to choose individual Asian stocks to buy.\n\nThe GMF fund was launched in March 2007. Its diverse portfolio of over 1300 stocks is heavily weighted towards information technology (25%), financials (18%), and consumer discretionary (15%) sectors. It has significant holdings in China (37%), India (28%), and Taiwan (26%). This dominance of Chinese stocks exposes investors to robust exports and one of the world\u2019s largest consumer markets as China\u2019s middle class expands.\n\nThe top 10 businesses comprise about a quarter of the net assets of around $350 million. Among these holdings are industry giants such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Reliance Industries (OTCMKTS:RLNIY) and HDFC Bank (NYSE:HDB).\n\nSo far in 2024, GMF has advanced over 5%, reaching a 52-week high on May 10. Trading at 14 times trailing earnings and 1.8 times book value, the fund still offers an attractive valuation level. Moreover, it has a 2.6% dividend yield, providing additional income potential. Finally, investors should note an annual expense ratio of 0.49%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 14.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $30.59 billion, suggesting a 1% rise from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.24 per share, indicating a fall of 20.5% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. The figure has moved 3.4% north over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nEarnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same once, the average surprise being 10.3%.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and EPS Surprise Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-eps-surprise | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nAlibaba\u2019s China commerce retail business is expected to have been impacted by macroeconomic headwinds prevailing in China.\r\n\r\nSluggish consumer discretionary spending is likely to have been another negative for the business in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThese factors are expected to have hurt the performance of the Taobao and Tmall Group in the fiscal fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nRising expenses related to new initiatives are likely to have been concerning for the company. The impacts of the sluggish Sun Art business, and stiff competition from domestic and foreign e-commerce companies are expected to get reflected in the upcoming results.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the growing momentum across the International commerce business is expected to have aided the company\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter performance.\r\n\r\nRobust Trendyol e-commerce business is likely to have contributed well to the performance of the International commerce retail division in the quarter under review. Strength across Lazada and AliExpress is likely to have been another positive.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum across cross-border-related value-added services is expected to have aided growth in Alibaba\u2019s International commerce wholesale business.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum across the company\u2019s Local Services Group, owing to strength in Ele.me and Amap businesses, is anticipated to have been a positive.\r\n\r\nAlso, strength in the Cainiao logistics business and the cloud division is expected to have driven top-line growth in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nAlibaba\u2019s strong cloud services portfolio, powered by advanced technologies like AI, generative AI, Machine Learning and the Internet of Things, is expected to have aided it in addressing the rising demand for cloud architecture.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alibaba this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here, as elaborated below.\r\n\r\nBABA currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +4.96%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some stocks worth considering, as our model indicates they have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA has an Earnings ESP of +2.50% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA\u2019s earnings is pegged at $5.49 per share, suggesting a significant jump from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure of $1.09 per share.\r\n\r\nAbercrombie & Fitch ANF has an Earnings ESP of +5.10% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\r\n\r\nAbercrombie & Fitch is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 29. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANF\u2019s earnings is pegged at $1.54 per share, indicating a significant jump from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure of 39 cents.\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale COST has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 30.

This compares to the last year\u2019s $1.50 per share and $29.15bn.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Taobao online shopping and Tmall B2C online retail platforms may have seen a strong sequential increase in gross merchandise value.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as UK business output and wages rise\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe platform has lowered costs as Chinese consumers seek discounts and lower-cost shopping but analysts are concerned this risks hitting margins.\n\nIt is also facing increasing competition from low-cost platforms, such as PDD Holding's (PDD) Pinduoduo and ByteDance-owned Douyin, Reuters reported.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nBitcoin is struggling to gain momentum as the global cryptocurrency market cap decreased by 1.1% to approximately $2.23tn overnight\n\nThe cryptocurrency was trading at around $62,504 on Monday and struggled to make any significant gains after it surged on the back of the approval of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite the slump, crypto investors were surprised by news that two Bitcoin wallets holding a combined 1,000 Bitcoin \u2014 worth $61m at current prices \u2014 have suddenly awoken after a 10-year hiatus, with the owners withdrawing almost all the funds available.\n\nNearly 1.8 million Bitcoin addresses have remained dormant for over a decade, according to a recent analysis by Chainalysis and Fortune.\n\nSoftBank (9984.T)\n\nSoftBank made a quarterly profit of 231.1bn yen (\u00a31.2bn) as the Japanese tech conglomerate benefitted from a boom in valuations driven by the AI hype.\n\nThe Tokyo-based company reported a second straight quarter of profitability in a result which was well ahead of analyst estimates, compared to a loss of 57.6bn yen (\u00a3295m) in the first three months of last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn February, chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto said the company was on a return to a \"growth trajectory\".\n\nThe Vision Fund investment unit booked an investment loss of 96.7 billion yen, missing estimates for a profit of 185.1 billion yen.\n\nRead more: Real UK wages rise as output per worker falls\n\nIn recent months, SoftBank has stepped up investments in AI-related hardware, taking controlling stakes in some cases.

        "content": "SEOUL, May 13 (Reuters) - South Korea's government signed an agreement on Monday with the local units of Alibaba's AliExpress and PDD Holdings' Temu to promote product safety, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said.\n\nThe agreement comes after heightened regulatory scrutiny of AliExpress, Temu and other Chinese e-commerce platforms as they significantly expand their user base in South Korea.\n\n\"Recently conducted safety inspections on products such as those for children sold on the AliExpress and Temu platforms detected a large amount of substances harmful to the human body, seriously threatening consumer safety\" and making the agreement necessary, trade watchdog KFTC said.\n\nRay Zhang, CEO of AliExpress Korea, and Qin Sun, co-founder of Temu, were present at the signing ceremony on Monday.\n\nUnder the agreement, KFTC will collect data on harmful products and provide them to AliExpress and Temu, which will inform sellers and consumers. The government will also check whether harmful products have been blocked from sale by the platforms.\n\nIt is the first time Temu has signed such a voluntary agreement anywhere in the world, the KFTC said, although other areas such as the European Union and Australia have histories of regulating dangerous products sold on online platforms through such agreements.\n\nSouth Korea's e-commerce market punches far above its weight as the fourth-largest in the world according to Euromonitor data, only behind China, the United States and the United Kingdom and bigger than Japan's market, despite having only the 29th largest population in the world.\n\nThe number of AliExpress and Temu users in South Korea has ballooned to 8.87 million and 8.29 million, respectively, as of March 2024, ahead of domestic shopping platforms such as 11st's 7.4 million users, according to the KFTC.\n\nThe growth rate is especially fast for Temu, which entered the South Korean market in July last year.\n\nSouth Korean e-commerce purchases from overseas have jumped to 6.8 trillion won ($4.97 billion) in 2023 from 5.3 trillion won in 2022, according to Statistics Korea.\n\n($1 = 1,368.5200 won) (Reporting by Joyce Lee Editing by Ed Davies)\n\nView comments",

Alibaba and JD.com have responded to this trend but they risk lower margins by doing so.\n\nThis low-cost battleground presents a challenge for Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com. Both have traditionally sought to move up the consumer value chain by selling increasingly premium products, such as Apple iPhones, Estee Lauder skincare and Tiffany & Co jewellery, but are now forced to defend that space while also offering a wider array of cheap products to stem market share leakage.\n\n\"As long as consumers remain highly cost-conscious such policies are likely to further slow revenue growth and erode profit margins,\" said S&P Global analyst Cathy Lai, adding that both Alibaba and JD.com are moving more into the unbranded goods territory that has been Pinduoduo's stronghold.\n\nAlibaba \"cannot ignore PDD, but nor can it quell the competitive threat by wholly adopting PDD's strategy. JD.com is in a similar position,\" she said.\n\n\u201cUnder its user first strategy, Taobao and Tmall Group proactively and aggressively invested in product supply, competitive pricing and quality service to meet all tiers of consumer demands,\" Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall Group said in statement responding to Reuters request for comment.\n\nJD.com did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year Alibaba's platforms, as well as JD.com pledged billions of yuan to subsidise discounts and coupons across regular sales events.\n\nThat effort resulted in mixed returns. In the September to December quarter last year, which included the year's biggest sales festival of Singles Day, revenue at Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall Group increased only 2% year-on-year while JD.com rose only 3.6%.\n\nFor the March quarter this year, analysts expect overall revenue at Alibaba, 65% of which is generated by its domestic e-commerce arm, to grow 5.3% year-on-year while JD.com will rise by about 6%, according to LSEG data. That is roughly in line with growth trends in recent quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn contrast, PDD Holdings revenue grew 123% in the December quarter, though this figure includes its fast-growing international platform, Temu, as well as domestic platform Pinduoduo, which generates the vast majority of PDD's revenue. Douyin, which does not regularly disclose sales data, was tipped to grow 60% for 2023, according to research firm eMarketer's estimates.\n\nChina's e-commerce companies are again entering a major discounting period, with weeks-long sales for major mid-year event 618, named for the date of JD.com's founding on June 18, to begin at the end of May.\n\nAdding to the current competitive environment facing Alibaba and JD.com, brands are spending more on live-streaming on sites such as Douyin and away from sites such as Tmall, said Jacques Roizen, managing director of China consulting at Digital Luxury Group.\n\nThe impact of the continuous discounts will \"kill\" the profits of brands such as cosmetics makers L'Oreal and Estee Lauder, which garner as much as 30%-40% of their China sales from e-commerce, Roizen said.\n\n\"At some point the brands are going to realize that they're not making any money (on low-price platforms),\" he said.\n\n\"But instead of taking the opportunity to counteract as a more premium, elevated, trustworthy platform, (Alibaba) decided to double down on discounts and promotion and guaranteeing the best price and all that stuff.

        "content": "Stocks rallied during a quiet week for economic data on Wall Street.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose just under 1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped almost 2%. The S&P 500 ended Friday back above 5,200 for the first time since early April. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 2% on the week and has closed higher for eight straight sessions.\n\nIn the week ahead, a crucial April inflation reading and an update on retail sales will highlight the economic calendar. Initial jobless claims will also be in focus after the weekly data set hit a surprise nine-month high in the first week of May.\n\nOn the corporate side, Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and Alibaba (BABA) lead a quieter week of quarterly reports as earnings season slows down.\n\nPrice check\n\nStickier-than-expected inflation reports headlined the first quarter of economic data, prompting investors to scale back expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nOn Wednesday, investors will get their first look at whether this trend continued into the second quarter with the release of the April Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street expects an annual gain of 3.4% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, a decrease from the 3.5% headline number in March. Prices are set to rise 0.4% on a month-over-month basis, in line with March's rise.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.6% year over year, a slowdown from the 3.8% increase seen in March. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the prior month.\n\nMorgan Stanley's economics team led by Ellen Zentner wrote in a research note that it believes inflation's descent \"begins\" with the April CPI report, led by easing price pressures in car insurance, rent, and healthcare. This, Zentner's team argues, could keep three Fed interest rate cuts on the table this year.\n\n\"Weaker monthly prints ahead with faster disinflation starting in [the second half of 2024] provides the Fed the confidence it needs that inflation is on a sustained path toward target,\" the Morgan Stanley team wrote.\n\nThis would likely be a welcome sign for markets, according to Fundstrat's head of research Tom Lee.\n\n\"We think April CPI could push higher the number of Fed cuts [priced into the market],\" Lee wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This, Lee said, would be a \"positive for stocks.\"\n\nEntering the week, markets are currently pricing in less than two interest rate cuts this year, per Bloomberg Data.\n\nStory continues\n\nRetail reading\n\nWith the Fed holding interest rates high for longer, economists continue to watch closely for any signs that the resilience in consumer spending is dwindling.\n\nA fresh reading on that trend is set to greet investors on Wednesday with the April retail sales report. Economists expect that retail sales increased 0.4% in April from the prior month, down from a 0.7% increase seen in March.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching results from Home Depot (Tuesday) and Walmart (Thursday) for signs of how the US consumer is holding up. Thus far, results from corporates have provided mixed results on how Americans are spending.\n\n\"Spending data have continued to surprise to the upside, but we get the sense households are increasingly prioritizing purchases,\" Wells Fargo's team of economists wrote in a weekly research note. \"Although volatile, non-discretionary categories have outpaced discretionary on trend for the past year. Industry comments included in Q1 earnings releases also emphasized a consumer trading down in search for value.\" Customers buy vegetables inside the Walmart Supercenter in North Bergen, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023, in New Jersey. (AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nEarnings update\n\nWith 92% of the S&P 500 done reporting first quarter earnings, the index is pacing for its highest year-over-year earnings growth since the second quarter of 2022. As of Friday afternoon the S&P 500 is on pace for earnings growth of 5.4% in the first quarter, notably above the 3.2% expected entering bank earnings in early April.\n\nFactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters points out that the index is actually doing even better when removing a massive earnings miss from just one company. Bristol-Meyers Squibb (BMY) reported a first quarter loss, dragging down the S&P 500's total performance this quarter. Excluding the healthcare company, the S&P 500 is pacing for 8.3% growth, per Butters.\n\nStocks aren't cheering hot data\n\nSince inflation began spiking in 2021, the stock market has gone through fits and starts in how it reacts to economic data. And that's carried on in 2024.\n\nIn a weekly note to clients, Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert examined how stocks are reacting to hotter-than-expected economic data. Investors started the year cheering the data as they priced in a \"soft landing\" for the US economy, where inflation would return to the Fed's 2% target without an economic downturn. At that time, the S&P 500 moved higher with Citi's Economic Surprise Index, which gauges whether data is coming in better than consensus expectations.\n\nBut after recent hot inflation data, markets have been more skittish as investors have increasingly priced in \"no landing,\" where inflation doesn't come down to the Fed's target but the economy keeps growing.\n\nThis had led to the market perceiving good economic news to be bad news for inflation, and therefore bad for the market's rate cut hopes. Subsequently, the correlation between the S&P 500 and economic surprise has headed toward negative territory.\n\n\"This suggests hot macro data has increasingly threatened the soft landing narrative that may be needed to push markets higher from these elevated valuation levels,\" Chronert wrote.\n\nIf inflation data returns to showing further cooling, the question is whether good economic growth news will be once again welcome by the market.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, April (3% previously)\n\nEarnings: BuzzFeed (BZFD), Petrobras (PBR), Stone (STNE), Tencent Music Entertainment (TME)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, April (88.2 expected, 88.5 previously); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, April (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, April (+2.2% expected, 2.1% previously)\n\nEarnings: Alibaba (BABA), Home Depot (HD), Canoo (GOEV), Rumble (RUM), Sony (SONY),\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, April (+0.4% expected, +0.4% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, April (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); CPI, year-over-year, April (+3.4% expected, +3.5% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, April (+3.6% expected, +3.8% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, April (+0.6% previously); MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending May 10 (+2.6%); Retail sales, month-over-month, April (+0.4%% expected, +0.7% previously); Retail sales ex auto and gas, April (+0.1% expected, +1% previously); NAHB housing market index, May (51 expected, 51 previously)\n\nEarnings: Cisco (CSCO), Dole (DOLE), Monday.com (MNDY), Super League (SLE)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending May 11 (233,000 previously); Housing starts month-over-month, April (8.6% expected, -14.7% prior); Building permits month-over-month, April (+1.6% expected, -3.7% prior); Philadelphia Business Outlook, May (8.7 expected, 15.5 prior); Import prices, month-over-month, April (+0.2% expected, +0.4% previously); Export prices, month-over-month, April (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); Industrial production, month-over-month, April (+0.2% expected, +0.4% previously)\n\nEarnings: Walmart (WMT), Applied Materials (AMAT), Baidu (BIDU), JD.com (JD), John Deere (DE), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), Under Armour (UAA)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Leading index, April (-0.2% expected, -0.3% previously)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Game-Changing Stocks to Unlock Life-Changing Wealth",
        "content": "Finding game-changing stocks in today\u2019s relatively overvalued and volatile market isn\u2019t as straightforward as it was when initial rate cuts drove top stocks to rock bottom prices. While many quickly point to tech stocks as the main wealth-unlocking stocks in today\u2019s economy, forward-thinking investors recognize the importance of diversifying across industries, geographic locations, size, scale, and more.\n\nIdentifying wealth-unlocking stocks also requires thorough due diligence to confirm that a company has a strategic vision and actionable plans to achieve its goals. Financial fundamentals and strength are crucial today; even the best strategies are futile if the company risks bankruptcy.\n\nThese game-changing stocks span a diverse range of sectors and value propositions, yet they all stand on solid financial footing and boast brighter long-term prospects than much of the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) image of a cloud surrounded by various symbols related to internet connectivity and interaction\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-purchaser eCommerce continues to soar in popularity, as demonstrated by giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT), a lesser-known but significant player, targets the massive B2B market, creating a comprehensive platform for businesses to source products and manage all associated logistics.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing, and payment processing. GigaCloud addresses these challenges by providing a complete suite of scaled B2B eCommerce solutions, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and critically, secure cross-border payment processing.\n\nGigaCloud\u2019s financial metrics are particularly striking. Despite a low price-to-earnings ratio of just 16.6\u2014less than the tech sector average of 36x\u2014the company has doubled its earnings per share over the last few quarters. and has robust free cash flow.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) occupies a unique position at the intersection of semiconductor stocks and wealth-unlocking stocks, a standout in a sector where many options are becoming increasingly expensive. The company specializes in developing semiconductor photomasks, a critical niche within the semiconductor sector with significant future implications.\n\nPhotronics\u2019 semiconductor photomasks enhance the precision and accuracy necessary for patterning microchips, advancing cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which demand increasingly complex and precise circuitry. Moreover, these photomasks contain fine details crucial for miniaturizing transistors and components, executing Moore\u2019s Law by shrinking complex technology. Trading at just 14x earnings, Photronics\u2019 blend of compelling value propositions and affordability places it at the vital nexus of current and emerging technologies, making it a prime candidate among game-changing stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX) a hand holding a lightbulb on a green background to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) is far less speculative than the others but still one of those wealth-unlocking stocks. The company trades at appealing low multiples \u2014 just 8x forward earnings and 0.5x sales \u2014 and maintains a low profile in the green tech and sustainable driving sectors. The company manufactures a range of automotive parts designed to reduce emissions and support zero-emission technologies, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nAmid dwindling consumer interest in pure-electric vehicles, highlighted by the rising sales of hybrid and gasoline vehicles over electric ones, Garrett Motion represents a practical investment for those focused on sustainability but skeptical about the swift global adoption of EVs.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock recently fell following an earnings report that revealed a 6% drop in quarterly sales, though its annual sales remained consistent and both margins and free cash flow remained strong. Despite being overlooked due to the market\u2019s fascination with rapid-growth opportunities, Garrett Motion is poised for recognition as economic shifts favor small-cap value stocks over current mega-cap market leaders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 30 richest people in Asia in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Richest People in Asia in 2024.\n\nAsia\u2019s Economic Outlook and Billionaire Economy\n\nAsia's compelling economic growth and wealth landscape has consistently seized global attention. Asia\u2019s richest person is Mukesh Ambani and he has long sustained his position, with a net worth of $110.2 Billion, as of May 7. According to Hurun Research\u2019s 2024 Global Rich List, Mumbai has emerged as Asia\u2019s billionaire hub, surpassing Beijing for the first time. Mumbai now has 92 billionaires while Beijing has 91, despite China\u2019s overall count of 814 billionaires compared to India's 271. Mumbai is the third leading city in terms of the total number of billionaires worldwide, with New York leading with 119 billionaires followed by London with 97. Other Asian cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and New Delhi are among the top cities in the world with the most billionaires. Beijing has 91, Shanghai has 87, Shenzhen has 84, Hong Kong has 65, and New Delhi has 57 billionaires.\n\nAsia is the wealthiest region in the world. According to the Global Wealth Report of 2023 by Credit Suisse, the total wealth of Asia-Pacific, including China and India, stood at around $177.82 trillion in 2022, while North America\u2019s total wealth was $151.17 trillion and Europe\u2019s wealth was around $104.41 trillion. The wealth per adult in Asia-Pacific in 2022 was around $61,154, excluding China and India. In 2022, the wealth per capita in China and India was $75,731 and $16,500, respectively. Major economies including Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates add to the total wealth of the Asia-Pacific. These countries are also some of the richest countries in Asia by GDP per capita.\n\nChina and India are two of the largest economies in the world in 2024. According to the economic outlook by the Asian Development Bank, the growth in East Asia rebounded from 2.9% in 2022 to 4.7% in 2023, as China removed all the pandemic restrictions. However, China has suffered an economic slowdown followed by the property market crisis and deflation threats. China is one of the countries with dangerously low inflation. The growth in developing Asia will remain healthy at 4.9% in 2024 and 2025, despite the slowdown in China. Moreover, the growth rate in the Caucasus and Central Asia increased from 5.2% in 2022 to 5.3% in 2023.

        "content": "After Charlie Munger\u2019s passing, investors began increasing speculation about Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) succession plan. Buffett\u2019s top two prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are reported to be increasingly contributing to Berkshire\u2019s investment execution, but their specific investment strategies or moves tend to be concealed within Berkshire\u2019s more comprehensive reporting; i.e., there\u2019s no annotation within any SEC filings stating which investment officer executed which trade.\n\nStill, we can look to history for hints about which trades made them rich beyond Berkshire. Doing so can reveal which sectors, trade multiples, and risk tolerance each prefers. Likewise, this could reveal one of the many directions Berkshire could take in the near future.\n\nWells Fargo (WFC) Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grass\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nTodd Combs is a man of many talents \u2014 a former hedge fund manager, current GEICO CEO, and one of Berkshire\u2019s most trusted investment managers. He\u2019s also one of two candidates positioned among analysts\u2019 top picks to replace Warren Buffett. Given his background, it\u2019s little surprise that Combs loved financial service stocks and all the \u201cboring but big\u201d companies Buffett tends to favor. And Combs loves few financial stocks as much as he does Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). He\u2019s been buying the stock since 2010 and likely made a tidy sum on the investment in the meantime.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWells Fargo is shaking up as we speak and just appointed former JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) exec Fernando Rivas as co-CEO of its investment banking arm (Combs is also a board member for JP Morgan). Wells Fargo\u2019s performance is already stellar, having returned 25% since January and more than 50% over the past year. Hence, Combs\u2019 conviction and continued optimization at Wells Fargo points to big things ahead for the stock favored by this Warren Buffett prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nCogent Communications (CCOI) A photo of the cogent logo inside a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nTed Weschler is the other potential heir apparent to Warren Buffett\u2019s current position. Among other notable achievements, most know him for whopping gains in his personal retirement account generated solely through publicly traded company investing. That strategy is opposed to Peter Thiel, who took advantage of insider access to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to turn stock options worth pennies into billions.\n\nOne of Weschler\u2019s biggest wins was an investment in Cogent Communications (NASDAQ:CCOI), one of the earlier internet consumer service providers in the US. In the 2010s, he turned a $159,000 investment into more than $51 million in just eight years. This shows two of Weschler\u2019s investment traits: his willingness to take risks on emerging trends (buying Internet stocks in the 2003 post-Dot Com era) and his skill in double-downing down when the investment turns in his favor.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s definitely a difference between Cogent Communications and Wells Fargo. Depending on which of the two gets the top spot (if either), Berkshire\u2019s trajectory could vary considerably.\n\nDaily Journal Corporation (DJCO) As inflation increases, bank stocks are where to be\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you\u2019re nervous about its future and want to \u201cdiversify\u201d into a more Berkshire-esque company before Buffett departs his role, you can always buy into Daily Journal Corporation (NASDAQ:DJCO). Charlie Munger, Buffett\u2019s former second-in-command, founded and formerly owned it. He structured similarly to Berkshire. Today, the conglomerate owns and invests similarly to Berkshire\u2019s best \u201cvalue first\u201d days.\n\nDaily Journal\u2019s top four holdings, endorsed by Munger, include Wells Fargo, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB). The company\u2019s shares have surged nearly 40% over the past year. In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway has seen a return of 25% during the same period, suggesting Munger\u2019s approach may be more attuned to value-driven economic conditions than Warren Buffett\u2019s. At the same time, it\u2019s a great way to honor Charlie Munger\u2019s legacy while acknowledging the strengths of the value-centric investing strategy across history.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Burberry, Vodafone, BT and Walmart",
        "content": "Luxury goods brand Burberry presents results this Wednesday. Above, British model Cara Delevingne at a Burberry show in Kensington Gore, west London.  (Joel Ryan, Associated Press)\n\nEarnings season continues, and investors have some high expectations for some of the major companies reporting next week such as Vodafone and Burberry.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nVodafone (VOD.L) \u2013 Reports on Tuesday 14 May\n\nVodafone shares have struggled and they rank among the worst performing FTSE 100 names over the past 5 years. So why would investors keep tabs on the telecoms operator when it presents its full-year results next Tuesday?\n\nChief executive Margherita Della Valle took the helm in January 2023 and last May launched a major overhaul which has seen the company try to merge its UK assets with those of Three and sell both its Italian and Spanish operations in two deals with a combined value of \u20ac12bn (\u00a313bn, .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Vodafone\u2019s recent third-quarter results provided some optimism for investors to cling to, but wider issues remain,\u201d Matt Britzman, equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\nInvestors should focus on the timing on the sale of the Spanish and Italian businesses and any updates on the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s investigation into the proposed merger of Vodafone\u2019s UK assets with those of Three.\n\n\u201cThe regulator, thus far, does not seem to welcome the plan. Margherita Della Valle hopes these deals will complete the reorganisation that she targeted back in May 2023 and will leave the company with a new, five-pronged reporting structure, of Germany, UK, Other Europe, Turkey and Africa,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\n\u201cAlso watch out for any comment on the proposed \u20ac2bn share buybacks after completion of each of the Spanish and Italian deals,\u201d they noted.\n\nOver the past year, Vodafone shares rank 92nd within the FTSE 100. In terms of share price change and over the past five years, they rank 93rd, thanks to a fall of more than 50%, according to AJ Bell.\n\nBurberry (BRBY.L) \u2013 Reports on Wednesday 15 May\n\nLuxury goods group Burberry will tell investors if London is still missing out to Paris and Milan as a tourist destination for high-spending shoppers as it presents its full-year results on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAJ Bell tells us that analysts currently expect total sales of \u00a32.9bn, a 1% drop on a constant currency basis, and an adjusted operating profit of around \u00a3405mn.\n\nThat is with a forecast \u00a3120m hit to sales and a \u00a360m hit to profits from currency movements. Adjust for that and operating profit is seen reaching \u00a3465mn for a margin of 15.8%.\n\n\u201cBurberry\u2019s shares have more than halved in the past year, to leave them back near the lows plumbed during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 (although the \u00a310 mark provided support then, as it did in 2016 and 2012, so it will be interesting to see if that level is breached or holds this time around),\u201d Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth wrote.\n\nInvestors should focus on comparing momentum in the third quarter compared to that shown earlier in the year. Any updates on the company\u2019s capital allocation policy will be of interest as analysts now expect Burberry to cut its total dividend to 52p a share from 61p a share.\n\nBT (BT-A.L) \u2013 Reports on Thursday 16 May\n\nBT shares are currently back at levels first seen in the immediate aftermath of the company\u2019s stock market flotation in late 1984 \u2014 when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Nigel Lawson was chancellor of the exchequer.\n\nIncreased competition, regulation and debt leading to minimal profit progression, has lead to a sharp decline in the stock, as well as dividend cuts.\n\nNew boss Allison Kirkby reaffirmed full-year guidance, alongside the third-quarter update back in February, as Openreach continues to build out Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) to improve the nation\u2019s broadband infrastructure, and as EE adds business and retail customers alike.\n\nBT is expecting growth in both sales and adjusted EBITDA for the year to March 2024. Consensus forecasts are looking for 2.1% sales growth to \u00a320.9bn and a 2% increase in adjusted EBITDA to \u00a38.1bn, ahead of a 0.8% gain and 1.4% gain to \u00a321bn and \u00a38.3bn respectively in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company also expects capital investment of \u00a35bn in the year to March, compared to \u00a35.3bn a year ago, and free cash flow of between \u00a31.0bn and \u00a31.2bn, down from \u00a31.3bn.\n\nAnalysts think capex will be flat and free cash flow up modestly in the coming year.\n\nNo change is expected in BT\u2019s annual dividend of 7.7p a share and the firm does not run a share buyback programme.\n\nWalmart (WMT) \u2014 Reports on Thursday 16 May\n\nWalmart will report earnings before the bell on Thursday and for the April-ended quarter analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect adjusted profit of 52 cents a share, up 6% year over year. Revenue is forecast to rise 4.5% to $159.2bn.\n\nDoug McMillon, president and chief executive officer, and John David Rainey, executive vice president and chief financial officer, will host a call on the day to discuss the results and answer questions.\n\nIt comes as holiday-quarter earnings and revenue for the January-ended quarter accelerated from the prior quarter, up 7% and 6%, respectively. Meanwhile, global e-commerce revenue increased 23% and topped $100bn. In the US alone, e-commerce revenue rose 17%.\n\nIt also recently announced plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio for $2.3bn, or 11.50 a share, and said it would open or expand more than 150 stores in America over the next five years.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 13 May\n\nCerillion (CER.L)\n\nSoftbank (9434.T)\n\nSuzuki Motor (7269.T)\n\nBridgestone (5108.T)\n\nTencent Music (TME)\n\nFerrovial (FER.MC)\n\nHochtief (HOT.MU)\n\nTuesday 14 May\n\nFlutter Entertainment (FLTR.L)\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nVirgin Money UK (VMUK.L)\n\nCurrys (CURY.L)\n\nSony (SONY)\n\nTencent (0700.HK)\n\nAlibaba (BABA)\n\nBayer (BAYN.DE)\n\nHome Depot (HD)\n\nWednesday 15 May\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nExperian (EXPN.L)\n\nImperial Brands (IMB.L)\n\nJD (JD)\n\nCommerzbank (CBK.DE)\n\nTUI (TUI.L)\n\nUbisoft (UEN.DE)\n\nCisco (CSCO)\n\nThursday 16 May\n\nUnited Utilities (UU.L)\n\nPremier Foods (PFD.L)\n\neasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nBaidu (BIDU)\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT)\n\nUnder Armour (UAA)\n\nFriday 17 May\n\nLand Securities (LAND.L)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nWatch: Stocks are thankful for strong earnings season amid inflation<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^DJI</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^IXIC</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^GSPC</a>) as inflation is anticipated to remain high.</p>\\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really that broadening out effect that we think is gonna take hold as we get deeper into this quarter,\u201d Freedman explains.

        "content": "Finding opportunities amid volatility is crucial for those pursuing growth and stability when uncertainty clouds the market. The first company, a fintech giant, leads with increasing revenue growth, transaction volume, and strategic international expansion. The second one is a formidable force in the e-commerce space, holding onto its market dominance in China.\n\nMoreover, the fourth one shows off a solid order book and a dedication to quality in the face of difficulties, while the third one comes into the limelight with a growing Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) sector and strategic content pipeline growth. The sixth company\u2019s global expansion and healthy comparable sales growth underline its resilience, while the fifth company\u2019s steady revenue growth and strong loyalty program solidify its position. The seventh company\u2019s innovative and widely used products in the semiconductor industry have increased revenue and market share, demonstrating its adaptability and strength.\n\nThese cheap companies offer investors attractive chances because of their solid fundamentals, calculated moves, and potential for development in various industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUndervalued Stocks Near Yearly Lows: PayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (PYPL) reported 9% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in constant dollars or 10% of 7.7 billion for Q1 2024. Total payment volume hit $403.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14% in dollars, and payment transactions grew 11% to 6.5 billion.\n\nAdditionally, development outlooks, especially on the continents of Europe and Asia, show a 17% YOY growth in international TPV on a currency-neutral basis, also confirming PayPal\u2019s strong global presence.\n\nAt the bottom line, non-GAAP EPS surged 27% from the past year to $1.08, while GAAP EPS was up 18% to 83 cents. In Q124, at a dearer valuation, PayPal repurchased nearly 25 million common shares for $1.5 billion. Thus, the significant rise of both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS attests to PayPal\u2019s inherent ability to translate top-line expansion into a more resilient bottom line. It\u2019s just a great way to create value for the shareholder.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaobao and Tmall Group (TTG) constitute Alibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) primary e-commerce business activities.\u00a0This\u00a0has seen consistent, massive growth. Despite the fierce competition in the industry, Alibaba continues to hold the top spot among Chinese consumers. Moreover, TTG has announced a\u00a0robust gross merchandise volume (GMV) increase YOY.\u00a0This\u00a0is primarily due to successfully implementing competitive and user-focused pricing strategies. The volume of orders and the number of active purchasers have increased significantly.\u00a0This\u00a0demonstrates the platform\u2019s continued popularity and customer confidence.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the platform\u2019s position in the market\u00a0is further reflected\u00a0in the size of its merchant base, which\u00a0is growing at a\u00a0double-digit rate. This development pattern demonstrates Alibaba\u2019s capacity to draw in and keep merchants, which\u00a0is essential for preserving a wide range of products. Alibaba understands that maintaining its competitive advantage requires investing in\u00a0key\u00a0competencies.\n\nIn short, to improve the shopping experience for customers, the company is prioritizing investments in\u00a0important\u00a0areas.

International markets were\u00a0fundamental\u00a0to counterbalance local decreases in subscriber growth.\u00a0Indeed, Warner Bros. Discovery profited from the expansion of streaming advertising despite difficulties in the markets for linear advertising. Revenues from D2C advertising surged by more than 50% in Q4 over Q3. Growth in ad-lite subscribers and great Max engagement both contributed to this acceleration.\n\nMoreover, Warner Bros. Discovery concentrated on improving revenue and segmentation by introducing new ad-supported products, among other measures. Worldwide expansion and strategic alliances, such as the introduction of Max in\u00a0important\u00a0markets like Europe and Latin America, also aided growth and revenue diversification.\n\nFinally, the company focuses on restoring the popularity of beloved properties like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and Superman. It channels investments into new spin-offs, sequels, and collaborations with influential artists to capitalize on the intrinsic worth of these properties and promote long-term growth.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nDespite temporary difficulties, Boeing\u2019s (NYSE:BA) backlog of over 5,600 commercial aircraft increased to $529 billion, suggesting a\u00a0substantial\u00a0market for its goods. Boeing\u2019s goods are trusted by the firm, as seen by the 125 net orders it received in the first quarter, including large orders from important clients like American Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines.

        "title": "The 3 Best Chinese Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "The last couple of years were forgettable for Chinese stocks to buy, but its prospects are now rising. Investment banks are bullish on the potential of Chinese stocks to outperform on the back of multiple tailwinds. Year-to-date (YTD) gains in the iShares MSCI China ETF are ticking higher than the broader market, a trend that\u2019s likely to continue for a while.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, Chinese stocks\u00a0were\u00a0pummeled\u00a0by regulatory crackdowns across various sectors. Fears over government intervention and the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China caused investing sentiment in Chinese equities to reach multi-year lows.\n\nHowever, the situation is\u00a0completely\u00a0different in 2024, with analysts pointing to a strong rally in Chinese stocks. According to\u00a0Goldman Sachs analysts,\u00a0a potential 40% increase in Chinese A-share valuations is possible. Similarly, UBS upgraded its outlook on the MSCI China Index (NASDAQ:MCHI) and Hong Kong stocks to overweight. Hence, with a more robust risk appetite and a more conducive investing climate, here are three Chinese stocks to wager on now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese tech giant\u00a0Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) has\u00a0been a\u00a0difficult\u00a0stock to back in recent years. Its stock has nosedived over the past three years, shedding 65% due to regulatory roadblocks in China and broader economic uncertainties. Consequently, BABA stock is now an eye-watering 74% below its all-time high price of $317.14. However, with the tailwinds in the Chinese economy and BABA\u2019s strategic initiatives to boost growth, BABA stock presents itself as an excellent value play.\n\nBABA faces stiff competition in\u00a0its domestic eCommerce market yet remains highly lucrative. According to Statista, the Chinese eCommerce market\u00a0is expected\u00a0to grow by 10% through 2029. Moreover, BABA has effectively diversified its eCommerce business to target the international market. In its most recent quarterly results, its consolidated\u00a0international growth jumped 44% to $4.02 billion.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s proactive approach to the cloud computing\u00a0market is another linchpin for\u00a0its long-term success. Estimates indicate that China\u2019s public cloud market will double to $137.1 billion by 2028 from $69 billion in 2024. The advent of AI\u00a0is set\u00a0to revolutionize the cloud market, and Alibaba is seizing this opportunity.\u00a0It recently implemented a significant price reduction for more than 100 core public cloud products, a move aimed at fueling\u00a0AI growth in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nBYD (BYDDF) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is a Chinese EV giant that stands head-and-shoulders above its competition. It\u2019s been hot on the heels of EV pioneer Tesla, eventually surpassing it in vehicle deliveries last year. Moreover, despite the downturn in the EV space, its recent performances have solidified its leadership position in the niche.\n\nBYD has triumphed in the intense price war within the EV market over the past few years.\u00a0This\u00a0is\u00a0largely due\u00a0to its unique battery technology, comprehensive production approach, and the benefits of its massive operational scale. In a recent press release, the EV juggernaut said it delivered\u00a0a whopping\u00a0936,446 total passenger vehicles YTD. EV sales made up roughly 18%,\u00a0a figure that\u00a0continues to rise in contrast to the predominantly higher plug-in hybrid sales.\n\nFurthermore, BYD\u00a0announced its latest pickup truck last month, the \u201cShark.\u201d It\u2019s a direct competitor to Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, with many showing a preference for the Shark. Also, BYD has been making inroads in autonomous vehicle technology, having launched an AI-powered solution\u00a0to conditionally automate driving. It seems like BYD is telling Tesla, \u201cAnything you can do, I can do better.\u201d\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nAI took the stock market to breathtaking heights last year. However, with investors pricing in several years of growth, they\u2019re now looking for tangible results. Companies making headway in developing and monetizing AI will likely emerge as long-term winners. In that context,\u00a0Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)\u00a0 seems to be the most compelling AI story\u00a0at this point.\n\nIts 2024 Baidu AI Developer Conference unveiled numerous developments and updates, further establishing its dominance in the AI sector. The most obvious one was that its AI chat tool in Ernie Bot\u00a0now has more than 200 million users. Moreover, over 80,000 clients used Qianfan, its foundation cloud-powered model platform, to develop 190,000 AI applications.\n\nFurthermore, it launched a suite of zero/low-code development tools to enable users to develop AI agents, apps, and models through natural language.\u00a0 Also, it released five new iterations of the Ernie Chatbot to quicken response times while lowering inferencing costs effectively. These powerful developments are essentially part of Baidu\u2019s strategy to make AI technology more accessible by effectively reducing costs while boosting computational efficiency.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "*\n\nHangzhou's move could lift local property market, say analysts\n\n*\n\nSome cities may follow in Hangzhou's footsteps, say analysts\n\n*\n\nChina's biggest cities not expected to drop all curbs soon\n\n(Adds comments, details, buyers' quotes)\n\nBy Liangping Gao and Ryan Woo\n\nBEIJING, May 9 (Reuters) - China's eastern metropolis of Hangzhou, among the country's most thriving cities, on Thursday said it will lift all home purchase restrictions to shore up its real estate market, raising the prospect of other cities following suit.\n\nAs of May 9, Hangzhou's government will no longer vet the eligibility of potential buyers, the city housing authority said in a notice.\n\nHangzhou is capital of the wealthy Zhejiang province and boasts some of China's most desirable and expensive real estate. That led local authorities to impose home purchase curbs to deter speculation.\n\nHome demand has sagged across the country since 2021, hitting even China's traditionally hot markets such as Hangzhou, as a debt crisis among property developers and a continued decline in prices chilled buyer sentiment.\n\nChinese authorities have been ramping up measures to prop up the troubled sector, but many of the policies have been piecemeal in nature or have only a limited, short-term impact.\n\nIn Hangzhou, new home prices edged up 1.0% year-on-year in March, the slowest pace in nearly six years, according to the latest data from China's statistics bureau.\n\nIn April, the city's new home sales stood at 310,000 square metres, slumping 75% year-on-year, a survey from real estate firm CRIC showed.\n\nOn April 30, a meeting of Communist Party leaders called for measures to support the property sector, saying it would improve policies to clear mounting housing inventories.\n\nA day earlier, the southwestern city of Chengdu, home to 21.4 million residents, dropped all home-buying limits.\n\nHangzhou is the first city to completely abolish purchase restrictions after the meeting, said analyst Yan Yuejin at E-house China Research and Development Institute.\n\nThe city's decision will be \"very inspiring\" for other cities that still have curbs on home purchases, and a wave of cities will see unprecedentedly large-scale policy easing starting in May, Yan said.\n\nThe city of 12.5 million people is China's answer to Silicon Valley, being home to technology majors including Alibaba Group and NetEase. It has been a magnet for tech talent from all over China, further elevating housing demand.\n\nThe policy change is to meet that demand and promote the healthy development of the real estate market, the housing authority said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe initial public reaction on social media platform Weibo was less than enthusiastic.\n\n\"What's the point of cancelling the purchase restrictions? Hangzhou's (high) property prices make it unaffordable for us to buy still,\" one netizen commented after the announcement.\n\n'INEFFECTIVE'\n\nBeijing and Shenzhen have announced easing measures to allow some residents to buy new flats in certain districts.\n\n\"Relaxing purchase restrictions has proven ineffective at reviving demand,\" said Joe Peissel, an economic analyst at Trivium China.\n\n\"That's because there are massive excess supplies of housing \u2013 both new builds and secondhand units \u2013 that weigh on prices and deter buyers from re-entering the market.\"\n\nSome so-called tier-one cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen are still enforcing strict home purchase restrictions.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the tier-one cities, which also include Guangzhou, to relax all their purchase restrictions anytime soon.\n\nGuangzhou recently eased restrictions on large flats.\n\n\"There is not going be a blanket drop for restrictions in all tier-one cities, but certainly they will continue to be relaxed until there is a sustainable rebound in demand,\" said Peissel.\n\n\"Prices need to fall much further before the property market reaches a new equilibrium and homebuyers have the confidence to re-enter the market,\" Peissel said.\n\nDuring the five-day May Day holiday, China's average per-day home sales by floor area plunged 47% from a year earlier, figures from the China Index Academy showed, among the country's largest independent real estate researchers.\n\nThe volume of sales was also down around 30% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019 for the same period.

        "content": "May 8 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's bourse operator said on Wednesday it plans to launch by the end of the year weekly options for 10 locally listed stocks, including HSBC Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, in a bid to offer investors additional risk-management tools.\n\nOptions are derivatives that offer the right to buy or sell particular securities, and can be used by investors to manage risks or execute trading strategies.\n\nThe 10 stocks also include the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX), Tencent Holdings, JD.com, Baidu and BYD Co, HKEX said in a statement on its website.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nHong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index has gained more than 7% so far this year, showing signs of life after four consecutive years of losses amid concerns about China's economic health and geopolitical tensions.\n\nAuthorities have stepped up efforts to lure back foreign investors and drum up confidence in the Asian financial hub.\n\nWeekly stock options can better meet investors' trading needs, HKEX said. Such contracts can be used by investors to manage positions in response to short-term or specific events such as corporate results.\n\nKEY QUOTE\n\n\"The new additions will add to the attractiveness and diversity of our derivatives market, further supporting investors' risk management needs,\" Brian Roberts, HKEX head of equities product development, said in the statement.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nThe planned instruments would be the city's first weekly options based on single stocks.\n\nHong Kong in 2019 introduced weekly options based on the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index , and such instruments have since become one of the fastest-growing product types.\n\nHKEX's derivatives market set a record by average daily volume in 2023 and the momentum has continued into 2024, according to the bourse.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The bounceback in Chinese stocks from their multi-year lows risks running out of steam unless the nation\u2019s tech giants can deliver on their earnings next week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial Israel Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short One Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire Einhorn Says Markets Are \u2018Broken.\u2019 Here\u2019s What Data Shows\n\nIndex heavyweights Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. both publish results next Tuesday, followed by JD.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. two days later. Those four firms alone represent more than a quarter of the MSCI China gauge.\n\nThe earnings scorecards come at a crucial time for the nation\u2019s key stock gauges that recently entered a bull market but are still some 40%-to-60% below their highs set in early 2021. A key question is whether the rebound \u2014 driven in part by cheap valuations and a rotation away from Japan \u2014 is durable or will once again be punctured by disappointing results.\n\n\u201cIf we do see these earnings coming through, the momentum will carry on,\u201d said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer at Matthews Asia in Hong Kong. \u201cAt the moment, we have signs that earnings are being downgraded less.\u201d\n\nChinese tech companies are something of a bellwether for the nation\u2019s entire stock market as they have tentacles stretching through the economy from their online sales, advertising and mobile games. The rebound in their shares \u2013 mainly due to the renewed interest from global funds in China\u2019s biggest and most liquid stocks \u2013 faces an earnings test as many are now technically overbought.\n\nTencent is expected to report a 6% increase in revenue for the quarter through March, while Alibaba\u2019s sales are forecast to rise by 5.6%, according to average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe early earnings data haven\u2019t been entirely favorable. Chinese firms have so far delivered a \u201csizable miss\u201d in first-quarter results, though there\u2019s been a sequential improvement from the previous three months, Morgan Stanley said in a client note last week.\n\nMSCI China Index members that have already announced first-quarter numbers have recorded an average 3% decline in earnings per share from a year earlier, with real estate, utilities and materials firms the worst performers, JPMorgan Chase & Co. also said last week.\n\nThere\u2019s still room for optimism though as tech companies were some of the best performers last year in boosting profits. Forward earnings estimates for an MSCI Index of 100 Chinese tech firms climbed about 20% in 2023, even as forecasts declined for other industries, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe sector is also still relatively cheap even after the Hang Seng Tech Index\u2019s 13% gain since the end of March. While the forward price-to-earnings ratio has risen to 16 times, it\u2019s still below the one-year average of 18, and well short of the five-year mean of 26.5.\n\nTraders have been quick to jump on positive business developments. Tencent\u2019s shares have been boosted by news the company is set to release the long-awaited Chinese version of Nexon Co.\u2019s Dungeon & Fighter mobile game this month, a title that will help revamp its aging portfolio. The stock of Xiaomi Corp. climbed to a two-year high after the smartphone maker announced better-than-expected initial orders for a new electric vehicle.\n\nStill, investors say they need to see sales growth to add to their conviction toward tech. Results from both Tencent and Alibaba missed analysts\u2019 estimates for the fourth quarter, and there\u2019s concern about China\u2019s disappointing retail-sales data published last month.\n\n\u201cThe overall backdrop of the internet industry hasn\u2019t been consistently strong,\u201d said Vivian Lin Thurston, a fund manager at William Blair Investment Management in Chicago. E-commerce firms, as a proxy for China\u2019s overall retail market, are unlikely to see a robust recovery just yet, she said.\n\nSkeptics also say the profitability gains have been mostly fueled by cost cuts rather than rising sales or greater pricing power.\n\n\u201cEven though there\u2019s always room for cost reduction, it\u2019s not a sustainable source of earnings growth,\u201d said Nicholas Chui, a fund manager at Franklin Templeton Investments in Hong Kong. \u201cRightfully, investors are on the lookout for more repeatable sources.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That\u2019s a Good Thing Chris Dixon\u2019s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto\u2019s Grifty Reputation\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy now according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts.\n\nAs companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season.\u00a0While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term \"AI\" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.\n\nWithin that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company\u2019s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a \"trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure\" to transform computing from \"general purpose to accelerated.\"\n\nSince then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:\n\n\"So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.\n\nAnd, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward.\n\nFor Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that \"AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that \"60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) \"deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.\"\n\n\"And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\"\n\nSo, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with. A couple of notable names are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top analyst AI stock picks, we ranked the top 35 holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF by their average analyst share price target upside and selected the top AI stocks.

        "content": "The ultimate goal of investing is to find possibilities poised for significant development. Michael Burry, a well-known investor, has recommended these three equities as strong candidates for profitable investments. Each firm represents a separate sector: retail, healthcare, and consumer discretionary.\n\nThe first is a massive\u00a0worldwide e-commerce company that stands out for its unwavering commitment to user-centric methods and aggressive pricing structures. Its remarkable Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) growth and rapidly increasing user engagement point to enormous potential for further growth.\n\nThe second, a mainstay\u00a0of the healthcare sector, demonstrates adaptability and a variety of income sources. Its revenue growth across several divisions shows stability and long-term survival, especially amid obstacles like market pressures and cyberattacks. The third one is a success story on the retail front, taking advantage of the rising demand for low-cost goods. The company may have long-term top-line growth and profitability. This is due to careful cost control and a concentrated strategy to boost price penetration.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese stocks are appealing due to their proactive approaches and historical success. Every business exhibits flexibility to prosper in the face of unpredictability.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe user-first and competitive pricing techniques employed by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) in Taobao and Tmall Group have led to a robust GMV rise in the company year-over-year (YoY). Solid growth in the number of orders placed and the number of active purchasers point to high user engagement and transaction activity. The platform is becoming increasingly merchant-friendly at a double-digit growth rate, boosting its competitiveness and range of products.\n\nAdditionally, with a 44% increase in international digital commerce sales YoY, Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) has experienced significant revenue growth. This\u00a0includes AliExpress and Cainiao. The rise has\u00a0been attributed\u00a0to improvements in the shopping experience and the rise of cross-border offers across all of AIDC\u2019s retail platforms. Cainiao\u2019s creation of cross-border logistics fulfillment solutions and a worldwide smart logistics network has boosted revenue and created synergies with cross-border e-commerce.\n\nFinally, with\u00a0over 60% YoY order growth on AliExpress, AIDC\u2019s business strategy and supply chain services upgrade have propelled fast expansion, reflected\u00a0in the AE Choice model. Therefore, by decreasing barriers for merchants, delivering a differentiated variety to the platform, and providing trusted cross-border shipping and other services, the model optimizes\u00a0the supply\u00a0chain and the consumer experience.\n\nStory continues\n\nCVS Health (CVS) The logo for CVS Pharmacy is displayed on a retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe Health Care Benefits Segment of CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) had a revenue increase of almost 25% YoY (Q1 2024), with sales reaching $32 billion. The expansion of Medicare, individual exchanges, and commercial group products were the main drivers of the income rise.\n\nFurther, the number of medical members also rose. This\u00a0was\u00a01.1 million in a row, up to 26.8 million. The revenue in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment reached around $29 billion, up about 3% YoY. In detail, increased prescription volume, immunization contributions, and pharmacy medication mix\u00a0drove\u00a0up income.\n\nMoreover,\u00a0CVS Health\u2019s revenue growth\u00a0across several business categories demonstrates the breadth of its line of business. CVS Health showed resiliency by generating revenue growth despite difficulties like the cyberattack on Change Healthcare and headwinds in the Medicare Advantage market.\n\nLastly, CVS Health concluded the quarter with over\u00a0$1.9 billion in cash, which\u00a0indicates the company\u2019s steady liquidity position. Overall, long-term\u00a0growth may stem from the company\u2019s fundamental capacity to adjust to unfavorable situations and\u00a0maintain\u00a0sales momentum.\n\nBig Lots (BIG) Retail workers checking produce at a grocery store.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nSurpassing their initial aim of one-third of sales, Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) has made\u00a0great\u00a0progress in growing the penetration of discount products. These products comprised approximately 60% of sales in Q4. The firm wants to increase the percentage of sales from discounts to 75%. For example,\u00a0extremely low\u00a0prices on food, hair care, bedding, laundry, and kitchenware\u00a0have shown\u00a0good\u00a0sell-through rates. This\u00a0is a sign of consumer\u00a0demand\u00a0and the ability to drive growth in sales on par.\n\nMoreover, Big Lots has exceeded its guidance by saving over $140 million in selling, general, and\u00a0administrative expenses over the year,\u00a0demonstrating its effective cost management and productivity growth. Compared\u00a0to the previous year, the corporation cut CapEx by about 60% and inventories by approximately $200 million. Liquidity has\u00a0been further boosted\u00a0by\u00a0monetizing\u00a0assets valued at over $300 million.\n\nLooking forward, the Big\u00a0Lots\u2019\u00a0approach has five main pillars. These are owning deals, expressing unwavering value, boosting retail relevance, gaining lifelong consumers through omnichannel initiatives, and boosting productivity. Overall, these initiatives may bring in additional gains in gross margin and comparable sales in 2024.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in BABA and CVS.

        "content": "The Chinese economy and many Chinese companies have struggled on a general scale over the last few years. The slowdown was primarily due to tightening government regulations and property pricing halting the expected recovery after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in 2023.\n\nWhile these macroeconomic conditions create uncertainty and scare away many investors, they offer a unique opportunity to find Chinese stocks that are performing exceedingly well but still receive low valuations. These three stocks offer investors the perfect chance to capitalize on these low prices and enjoy the fruits of these successful companies\u2019 labor.\n\nLet\u2019s learn more about the exciting products and services, smart investments and diverse revenue streams that give these undervalued stocks the best chance to weather the macroeconomic storm.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese tech company with diverse offerings and services. It operates in several different markets, including mobile gaming, music streaming, messaging and cloud-platform services.\n\nTencent generates a considerable portion of its revenue through its widely popular mobile games, such as PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings. The number of Tencent mobile and PC games that surpassed the Chinese average daily user count of 5 million for mobile and 2 million for PC increased to 8 games in 2023 from 6 in 2022.\n\nTencent\u2019s gaming segment is estimated to account for a little less than half of the company\u2019s revenue, which reached $86.0 billion in 2023. However, the company also has a wildly successful messaging platform, WeChat, with over 1.3 billion monthly active users.\n\nTencent plans to monetize further and improve profits from WeChat by focusing on advertising for many other services. Tencent has gaming and advertising to continue to drive profits but also has a foothold in cloud services and business software, giving it much-needed diversity to survive and grow long-term.\n\nOverall, the company\u2019s excellent prospects and $41.4 billion gross profit for 2023 make its 16.71 P/E ratio too good to be true. Investors should look no further for an undervalued Chinese stock to buy this month.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is another promising Chinese tech company with an established reputation. It is one of China\u2019s most popular search engines and has an exciting cloud platform, giving it great potential to perform. Baidu has also expanded its investment base, starting a $145 million venture capital fund for generative AI start-ups last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some investors are hesitant due to Baidu\u2019s close relationship with the Chinese government, there is less reason to fear the risk of delisting when the stock is valued relatively low. Baidu trades at a P/E ratio of 18.3, and while it had a modest 9% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023, the company has a fantastic potential upside.\n\nRecently, Baidu\u2019s AI chatbot tool \u201cErnie\u201d was reported to have reached over 200 million users and is frequently compared to ChatGPT. The potential that such a popular and advanced tech tool brings to Baidu\u2019s future is undeniable.\n\nWhile Baidu\u2019s appeal to American investors carries some risk, if you can stomach it, it is one of the best buys in Chinese stocks. Its potential to continue to grow as a search engine giant, along with several other revenue streams trading at a low valuation, is undeniable.\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings (NYSE:BABA) is another tech company with a wide range of services and platforms and phenomenal growth potential. Alibaba is not only one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world but also provides media, entertainment, and cloud platform services.\n\nIn Alibaba\u2019s most recent earnings, the company reported $62,904 million in revenue for fiscal 2024, an 11% year-over-year increase. Free cash flow reached $11,556 million, representing an increase of 46% year-over-year.\n\nThe stock is performing exceedingly well, considering its P/E ratio of 17.3. It is, without a doubt, undervalued from a purely financial perspective. Alibaba also has a history of making intelligent investments to secure its future, investing $1 billion in its partners to support the ecosystem of its up-and-coming cloud platform.\n\nFuture growth is almost inevitable, and the Chinese government and economy are factors to consider, but this should not make you count this excellent tech stock out for good.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It allows users to make payments with apps from their home countries via Alipay\u2019s QR code network and local partners abroad.\n\nDouglas Feagin, Senior VP at Ant Group, emphasized that travelers prefer using their trusted home-country e-wallets instead of unfamiliar foreign apps, CNBC\u00a0reports.\n\nWith this in mind, Alipay+ connects 88 million merchants across 57 countries and regions to over 1.5 billion consumer accounts from 25+ e-wallets and banking apps. They partner with digital payment services like Singapore\u2019s SGQR and South Korea\u2019s ZeroPay.\n\nAnt\u2019s early global strategy, focused on Southeast Asia, saw investments in Singapore\u2019s 2C2P and South Korea\u2019s Kakao Pay, which now facilitate their international growth.\n\nThe company also expanded into emerging markets like Sri Lanka and Cambodia. It established European partnerships, such as with Italy\u2019s Tinaba and Nexi, and in the Middle East through Dubai Duty Free.\n\nThey are focused on large tourism markets like Japan, Thailand, and Singapore while targeting European, Latin American, and Middle Eastern regions to continue growing their merchant coverage.\n\nPrior reports indicated\u00a0Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) enhancing its cross-border remittance capabilities by joining forces with Alipay. This partnership builds on their existing relationship and allows users to transfer and receive money to their digital wallets nearly instantly.\n\nMeanwhile analysts remained positive over Alibaba\u2019s positioning as a key China e-commerce player\u00a0as it looks \u00a0to pivot toward building on robust growth in cross-border volumes, and driving revenues in the public cloud market.

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +13.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share, indicating a change of -23.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. This estimate has changed -9.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.29 indicates a change of -1.2% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for BABA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $130.77 billion and $139.99 billion estimates indicate +3.7% and +7.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $36.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.46%. The EPS surprise was -2.2%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In the current stock market, companies poised for a notable turnaround frequently present prospects for profitable investments.\u00a0This\u00a0is a fascinating story of three undervalued comeback stocks offering unique investment potential. Like high-yield assets, these businesses show encouraging signals of growth and recovery despite confronting their unique set of obstacles.\n\nTo start, the first one\u00a0is poised\u00a0for greater profitability and market dominance due to the strong revenue growth in its divisions, driven by the expansion of cross-border fulfillment solutions. Next, the second one\u2019s increase in active customers highlights effective user acquisition and retention tactics and points to a promising future for market expansion.\n\nFinally, the third one\u2019s outstanding metrics for member and product growth demonstrate its capacity to draw in and keep clients for various financial products, establishing it as a major force in the fintech sector. Thus, the third company\u2019s robust capital ratio and good financial stability support growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese factors not only provide confidence but also lay a robust platform for expansion ambitions. The companies\u2019 competitive advantages further bolster this confidence, making their growth potential even more promising.\n\nComeback Stocks: Alibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpanding cross-border fulfillment solutions is the primary driver of Alibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) Cainiao division\u2019s notable revenue growth. Strong demand and adoption are reflected in the 24% revenue growth year-over-year (YOY), mainly attributable to the revenue from cross-border logistics services.\n\nAdditionally, Cainiao\u2019s enhanced cost efficiency and rising revenue are represented in a positive adjusted EBITDA instead of a loss in the prior year. The positive adjusted EBITDA shows that the increased profitability and financial performance can\u00a0be attributed\u00a0to effective cost-control methods.\n\nMoreover, Ele.me\u2019s stellar lead and Amap\u2019s explosive growth drive Local Services Group\u2019s robust revenue growth. The Local Services Group is generating\u00a0substantial money based on its robust expansion.\u00a0The Local Services Group performs better overall because Ele.me\u2019s\u00a0enhanced unit economics and growing scale led to fewer losses in Alibaba\u2019s home operations.\n\nFinally, the Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) has seen a\u00a044% YOY increase in international digital commerce sales, which suggests that Alibaba\u2019s global digital commerce operation has grown significantly.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD (NASDAQ:JD) had a spike in the number of active users in Q42023, suggesting consistent expansion in its user base. The acceleration suggests that\u00a0user acquisition or retention activities have significantly increased. This increase implies that JD\u2019s client acquisition and retention methods are working. Based on that, JD might continue to offer growth in active consumers over the long term.\n\nFurthermore, users\u2019 shopping frequency on JD increased in Q4 and for the entire year. The rise in devoted current users and Plus members is responsible for increased shopping frequency. Hence, the\u00a0stronger\u00a0order volume grew from improved user engagement, reaching double-digit YOY growth in Q4 and accelerated for three straight quarters.\n\nFinally, JD Plus\u2019s membership base continued to increase rapidly in Q4.\u00a0With that, Plus members\u2019 Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) contributed quicker than the overall GMV. This demonstrates the appeal and utility of a JD Plus subscription. Therefore, net Promoter Scores (NPS) for\u00a01P and 3P firms significantly improved in Q4 due to customer experience enhancement initiatives such as free delivery, rapid refunds, and best price guarantees.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi logo sign on headquarters facade. Social Finance is an online personal finance company.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast on the list of comeback stocks to buy is SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI). SoFi\u2019s member and product growth indicators demonstrate the company\u2019s capacity to draw in and hold onto consumers, a considerable pattern propelling its growth. In Q12024, SoFi\u2019s membership base grew rapidly, with 8.1 million users, a 44% YOY increase.\n\nFurthermore, throughout the quarter, the firm signed up 622,000 new subscribers.\u00a0Indeed, the solid surge in membership attests to SoFi\u2019s robust brand attractiveness, successful marketing approaches, and capacity to draw clients across its range of product offerings.\n\nMoreover, members\u2019 product adoption showed a robust increase, with\u00a0989,000 new products\u00a0added in Q1. Ninety-three percent of these new product additions were in the Financial Services category, suggesting that cross-selling and user interaction are rising on the platform.\u00a0The solid increase in new product offerings indicates SoFi\u2019s ability to successfully monetize its membership base by offering various financial services and products. Thus, with a total capital ratio of 17.3%, SoFi has high financial stability and capital sufficiency.\n\nOverall,\u00a0the notable increase in customer deposits indicates that the firm is becoming less\u00a0dependent on pricey outside funding sources, improving its capital position and flexibility.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in BABA, JD and SOFI.

        "title": "Alibaba Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "content": "Alibaba Group(NYSE: BABA) has had a rough time recently, with the stock down nearly 60% over the past five years. However, billionaire co-founder Jack Ma recently praised the company and its restructuring efforts. Ma said that while mistakes have been made in the past, the decision to split the company into six divisions has led it to become more agile and customer-focused.\n\nLet's look at Alibaba's prospects and if the stock is currently a buy, sell, or hold.\n\nA free-cash-flow machine\n\nDespite its struggles, the one thing Alibaba has consistently been able to do is produce a tremendous amount of cash flow. For its fiscal third quarter, ended in December, it generated operating cash flow of $9.1 billion and free cash flow of $8 billion. Through its first nine months of the year, the company produced $22.4 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nStrong cash flow is important as it gives companies a lot of flexibility. They can reinvest it to reinvigorate growth in the company, or use it to make acquisitions. The cash can also be used to buy back shares.\n\nAlibaba has been aggressive on the share repurchase front, announcing a $25 billion share buyback program in conjunction with its fiscal Q3 results in February. The company quickly acted on the repurchase authorization, buying back $4.8 billion in shares in the first three months of 2024. Alibaba has now repurchased $23.3 billion in shares over the past two years.\n\nAlibaba is also looking to invest in its two core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing, to reignite growth. For its e-commerce business, Alibaba is looking to invest in price competitiveness, service, and user experience. Improving product supply and adding more branded and direct-from-manufacturer products to its platform will be a key initiative that will include offering flexible models to suppliers so they can offer their products at the best prices.\n\nThe company is also investing in the customer experience from presale to logistics. In addition, Alibaba is in the early days of testing its own internally developed large language model (LLM) for artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve its search and advertising capabilities.\n\nFor its cloud computing business, Alibaba is looking to move customers away from low-margin project-based contracts toward its public cloud offering. The company is increasing investment in AI-related hardware and software and scaling out infrastructure to support AI-driven computing power demand. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStill some risks ahead\n\nChinese companies are more limited with AI given U.S. bans on the latest GPU technology from Nvidia and others, so Alibaba may not see the same immediate benefit that U.S. cloud computing companies like Microsoft and Alphabet are seeing. At the same time, Alibaba cut cloud computing prices to lure AI developers to its data center offering. So while AI has some long-term potential, it could be a bit of a headwind in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba's e-commerce business, meanwhile, has also had to invest in price given the strength of rival PDD Holdings and its popular Pinduoduo platform that has been rapidly taking share. PDD's success has led the Chinese e-commerce market to become even more competitive, although Alibaba's T-Mall and Taobao platforms are still two of the strongest e-commerce sites in the country and tend to do well at the higher end.\n\nA lackluster Chinese economy coming out of pandemic lockdowns has also weighed on Alibaba's results. The Chinese economy did pick up in the first quarter, and the Chinese government has indicated it will take measures to support the economy. Any rebound in the Chinese economy should be good for Alibaba, although risks remain.\n\nA very cheap stock\n\nOne of the big things that sticks out with Alibaba is its valuation. Trading at just about a 9x forward P/E ratio, the stock is very cheap for a company that has grown its revenue by 9% over the past nine months and is generating a lot of cash flow. BABA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNow, a cheap valuation is not reason enough to buy a stock, as it could be a value trap. However, Alibaba is a cheap stock of a leading Chinese company that generates a prolific amount of cash that it is using to buy back shares and invest in its business to reignite growth. While the stock does come with risks, its upside over the next several years looks intriguing given these characteristics. As such, Alibaba stock is a buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "If you're an investor on a budget who's looking for deals, there are some great options out there right now. You don't need to break the bank to own shares of promising companies. While many top stocks are trading at sky-high valuations, there are multiple stocks that you can buy at dirt-cheap valuations today.\n\nThree stocks that have underperformed the S&P 500 and its 7% gains this year but could be formidable long-term investments are Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: BABA), Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA), and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). Here's a closer look at why you'll want to consider buying these stocks right now.\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings\n\nChinese stocks come with inherent risks, which is why many investors are hesitant to buy them. In the past, there have been concerns about whether Chinese stocks may get delisted from U.S. exchanges, and whether the Chinese government may impose regulations that affect their growth prospects.\n\nSo far, those risks appear to be a bit overblown. And if you're willing to take on a bit of uncertainty, you can get a promising growth stock in Alibaba Group Holdings. The Chinese tech company has a diversified business that includes e-commerce, cloud, media, entertainment, and other segments.\n\nIn the last three months of 2023, the company reported revenue of $36.7 billion, which grew at a rate of 5% year over year. It generated growth in all its key segments. And the Chinese economy looks to be in solid shape, with gross domestic product for the first three months of 2024 growing at a rate of 5.3% -- higher than analyst expectations of 4.6%.\n\nAlibaba offers investors a great way to invest in the Chinese economy. With a low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 9, which is based on analyst expectations of future earnings, Alibaba makes for an enticing buy right now. You can buy the stock for around $75 per share.\n\nComcast\n\nAnother solid growth stock you can buy for less than $100 is Comcast. It's currently trading at less than $40, so you can buy two shares of the media company with $100 and still have cash left over. And like Alibaba, it's trading at a forward P/E of around 9.\n\nThe company recently reported earnings for the first three months of the year. They weren't all that exciting, but they were solid nonetheless. Sales of $30.1 billion rose by just over 1% year over year, and earnings per share came in at $0.97 -- up around 7% from the same period last year. Comcast's streaming service, Peacock, has also been doing well with paid subscribers rising by 55% versus a year ago, reaching 34 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the longer run, there could be more room for growth as Comcast leverages its strong brands. Universal, a subsidiary of Comcast, is planning to launch the Universal Epic Universe theme park next year, which will feature the Harry Potter, Super Mario, and How to Train Your Dragon franchises.\n\nWith a low valuation, some enticing growth potential, and a dividend yielding 3.2%, Comcast makes for an underrated investment to add to your portfolio right now.\n\nFord Motor\n\nRising inflation hasn't been making automotive stocks hot buys of late. Ford's stock is up just a modest 5% this year, and at a price tag of around $13, you can easily add multiple shares of the company to your portfolio for less than $100. Its forward P/E of 6 makes it the cheapest stock on this list.\n\nThe company offers investors a cheaper way to invest in electric vehicles than rival Tesla, which, despite its fall this year, still trades at a staggering forward P/E of more than 60. Ford has been losing money on EVs, but its more diversified business gives investors a more balanced auto stock to buy and hold.\n\nFord's revenue for the first three months of 2024 totaled $42.8 billion, rising by a modest rate of 3% year over year. Net income of $1.3 billion declined by 24% as the company has battled rising expenses. But its adjusted per-share profit of $0.49 beat analyst expectations of $0.42.\n\nFord remains a top automotive stock, and it can make for an excellent long-term investment. It also pays investors an attractive dividend that yields 4.7%.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 25 richest billionaires in technology industry. To skip our detailed analysis of the technology industry, go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires in Technology Industry.\n\nTechnology Market Outlook\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, 2023 experienced a technological comeback and generative AI was one of the major drivers of the tech industry. Generative AI is the technology that powers large language models such as ChatGPT and Adobe Photoshop's new AI image filler, Generative Fill. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the AI market was valued at $40 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 42%. The increasing demand for generative AI products will add nearly about $280 billion of new software revenue. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are four of the biggest tech companies investing heavily in generative AI and are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of AI, as per\u00a0 Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIn a report, Deloitte highlighted that global IT investments are projected to experience a double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services in 2024. AI-related investments are expected to reach $200 billion globally by 2025, primarily led by the US. Almost all enterprise software firms will embed generative AI into at least some of their products in 2024, as per Deloitte. The shift towards generative AI will likely help software companies reach an average revenue of $10 billion by the end of 2024. For the firms working on the hardware front, Deloitte estimates their revenue to surpass $50 billion in 2024, driven by the chips and servers market.\n\nOn April 28, Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk, on X posted that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will spend around $10 billion in combined training and inference AI during 2024. Musk further said, \u201cAny company not spending at this level, and doing so efficiently, cannot compete.\u201d\n\nThe technology industry is diverse and has vast market segments. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global IT market was valued at $8.50 trillion in 2023 and is expected to reach $9.03 trillion in 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. By 2028, the IT market is anticipated to reach $12.41 trillion, growing at a compound growth rate of 8.3% from 2024 to 2028.\n\nMajor Players in The Technology Industry\n\nSome of the major players in the tech space include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let's discuss some recent updates by these companies.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) has become one of those few companies achieving the $2 trillion market capitalization mark. The company reached the $2 trillion market capitalization following its first quarter earnings beat. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the earnings for the first quarter of 2024.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is planning for the next wave of AI investment. Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cIt was a great quarter led by a strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we've gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue.\n\nNow, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation and search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech giant that is massively expanding in AI services. On April 29, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that it is collaborating with German mass media firm, Axel Springer SE. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Axel Springer SE have expanded their partnership across advertising, AI, content, and cloud computing. The collaboration between the two firms aims to leverage cutting-edge innovation to evolve independent journalism worldwide. Here is what Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO, Satya Nadella, said regarding the partnership extension:\n\n\u201cThis new generation of AI is transforming nearly every aspect of work and life, including how people search for and consume content online. Our expanded partnership with Axel Springer brings together their leadership in digital publishing with the full power of the Microsoft Cloud \u2014 including our ad solutions \u2014 to build innovative AI-driven experiences and create new opportunity for advertisers and users.\u201d\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world.

        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) closed the most recent trading day at $75.51, moving +0.88% from the previous trading session. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.34% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.23%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.33%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 2.7% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 4.37%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.05%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Alibaba will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on May 14, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Alibaba to post earnings of $1.20 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 23.08%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $30.83 billion, up 1.7% from the year-ago period.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Alibaba. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 9.8% lower. Alibaba presently features a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alibaba has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.03 right now. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.6.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 35, which puts it in the top 14% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Alibaba (BABA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alibaba (BABA).\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy, representing 81.3% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alibaba, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs BABA a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 9.8% over the past month to $8.39.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Alibaba. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alibaba with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If any company reflects the state of China\u2019s economy, it would be e-commerce and cloud-computing firm\u00a0Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Perhaps Alibaba stock is a bullish bet on China\u2019s economic recovery, just as much as a wager on Alibaba as a company. In that light, there are definite risks to investing in Alibaba, though there are also potential rewards.\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously discussed, Alibaba is very reasonably valued and offers some portfolio exposure to generative artificial intelligence. I\u2019m not against investing in Alibaba for the long term. Today, however, I\u2019m suggesting keeping your Alibaba share position small, if you choose to take a position at all.\n\nAlibaba and China\u2019s Uneven Recovery\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting one stock represents the entirety of China\u2019s economy. However, if you own Alibaba stock, and perhaps also add some Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock, you\u2019ll practically have a do-it-yourself China exchange-traded fund.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and supply-chain constraints have caused ongoing problems for each of these China-based businesses. Certainly, China\u2019s uneven recovery has weighed on Alibaba\u2019s financial results. Alibaba founder Jack Ma remains confident; he assured,\u00a0\u201cWe are\u00a0starting to operate on the diseases of a big company.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all fine and well, but Alibaba and other technology-focused China-based businesses have to contend with governmental interference. Remember, if you own Alibaba stock as a proxy for China\u2019s economy, then your portfolio will be exposed to China\u2019s problems.\n\nAmong those problems is China President Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on the nation\u2019s biggest businesses. Beijing\u2019s (i.e., the Chinese government\u2019s) restrictive policies have weighed heavily on companies like Alibaba, Nio and Tencent.\n\nGood News and Bad News From China\n\nOn the economic front, there\u2019s good news and bad news for China and, by extension, for Alibaba. The good news is that China\u2019s first-quarter 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.3% year over year. Economists had only expected China\u2019s GDP to grow 4.5% YOY.\n\nHowever, Beijing could introduce new, restrictive policies at any given moment. Furthermore, not all of the data from China is positive. For example, China\u2019s industrial output increased 4.5% YOY in March, while economists had expected 5.5% growth.\n\nChina\u2019s retail sales grew 3.1% YOY in March, and this result fell short of the economists\u2019 prediction of 4.5% growth.\n\nZichun Huang, an economist with Capital Economics, concluded that China\u2019s economic recovery \u201cclearly remains fragile.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Alibaba\u2019s investors will need to closely monitor the ongoing developments in China. It won\u2019t be enough to just study Alibaba\u2019s earnings reports; I wish it could be as simple as that, but it\u2019s not.\n\nAlibaba Stock: Consider Your Position Sizing\n\nI\u2019m not trying to dissuade you from investing in Alibaba. It\u2019s a huge, famous company, and Ma\u2019s confidence should provide some encouragement.\n\nOn the other hand, China\u2019s problems will also be Alibaba\u2019s problems. If Beijing inhibits the country\u2019s economic growth, Alibaba and its stakeholders will have major problems.\n\nSensible investors should understand the political/macroeconomic risks and only own a few shares of Alibaba stock. If you\u2019re not prepared to conduct your due diligence on China\u2019s economy, you don\u2019t have to invest in Alibaba at all.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "title": "3 Comeback Stocks to Buy on the Cusp of Explosive\u00a0Gains",
        "content": "The past few years have been a rollercoaster ride for investors, with many quality stocks declining substantially from their peaks and yet to regain lost ground. However, solid businesses with strong fundamentals rarely disappoint in the long-run. Though temporarily beaten down, these companies are likely to make a full recovery and deliver substantial returns, for those with the patience to hold through the storm.\n\nWhile timing the exact bottom is impossible,\u00a0there are bargains emerging\u00a0among stocks that still have big growth runways ahead along with bargain-basement share prices unlikely to plunge much further. Of course, with the possibility that markets are at a turning point, it makes sense to remain prudent and avoid overexposure. But for investors comfortable with some modest risk in exchange for multibagger upside over the coming years, here are three promising comeback stocks to consider.\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is one of the many fintech firms\u00a0that have been\u00a0struggling to get their stock prices up. SQ stock has been trading around $70 (\u00b1$20) for almost\u00a0the last\u00a0two years. However, the company\u2019s core business has shown no substantial slowdown in growth, and management appears to be executing very well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlock is one of the companies that\u00a0was seen\u00a0as a high-growth alternative to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), with\u00a0the drawback being that this company did produce the kind of profits PayPal did. This drawback is\u00a0also\u00a0no longer a cause for concern, since Block recently turned profitable and is growing its\u00a0profits\u00a0rapidly.\n\nBlock grew revenue by 25% in\u00a02023 with net income for the whole year turning positive, at just $9.8 million. Net income\u00a0is expected\u00a0to rise significantly higher in the coming years. Additionally, the company\u2019s earnings per share are expected\u00a0to\u00a0rise\u00a0from just $1.80 in 2023 to $6.40 in 2026.\u00a0This\u00a0means this fintech play is\u00a0not only high growth but also\u00a0highly profitable.\u00a0Software companies that can churn out good profits and double-digit growth\u00a0often\u00a0trade near\u00a010-times forward sales. Block is a steal in comparison.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is another company that has disappointed shareholders. Regardless, the reason behind Alibaba\u2019s underperformance is pretty\u00a0obvious.\u00a0This company has been under attack by Chinese authorities, and investors are now considering the company\u2019s very\u00a0sluggish growth.\u00a0Moreover, it is\u00a0important\u00a0to\u00a0keep in mind\u00a0that the broader Chinese market has been trending lower. The Hang Seng Index\u2019s returns have been a joke compared to the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, or any other major index from most countries. It is understandable why many investors steer clear from Chinese stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, I still think that the upside potential here is very significant\u00a0and\u00a0BABA stock is likely bottoming out at these levels. China\u2019s e-commerce market is still projected to grow at a 10%-plus compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2029, so I believe Alibaba has the potential for valuation expansion over time. Jack Ma also stepped down from being Alibaba\u2019s CEO, and China\u2019s recent\u00a0bout\u00a0of stimulus measures has helped the stock market pull a slight recovery recently.\u00a0If\u00a0we see sustained recovery for Alibaba, it could turn out to be one of the best comeback stocks on this list.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis\u00a0is another Chinese company, but the growth story with this company has been entirely different. Moreover, this stock is not as beaten down as the other ones, but I still see explosive growth potential ahead. The company operates Pinduoduo in China and Temu outside of China.\n\nYou have likely heard of Temu, as that app is now one of the most popular apps on Apple\u2019s app store due to its bargain pricing. This popularity is only getting better with time.\n\nThe growth here has been stellar, too. PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) grew revenue by 89.7% year-over-year in 2023\u00a0and\u00a0net income jumped 90.3%. Analysts expect revenue to grow another 49.3% in\u00a02024\u00a0along with 30% earnings per share growth. You\u2019re paying just 15-times forward earnings for the stock. That\u2019s dirt cheap, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Many undervalued stocks have declined significantly during the market selloffs in late-2021 and throughout 2022. While the broader market has recovered, these beaten-down stocks continue to trade sideways, with some even drifting lower. However, their underlying businesses have often continued to see growth, despite their stagnant share prices.\n\nThese undervalued stocks resemble coiled springs ready to rebound. If they can deliver any positive surprises or if sentiment shifts, they could break out and deliver multi-bagger returns. Their cheap valuations provide a floor limiting further downside. With upside potential and limited downside risk, it might pay to consider these names. Here are three such undervalued stocks I\u2019m watching right now.\n\nRingCentral (RNG) A man wearing a headset speaks to someone on a computer.\n\nSource: LDprod / Shutterstock.com\n\nRingCentral (NYSE:RNG) is a company that provides internet-based communication services. The company offers phone calls, messaging, and video meetings in one place. RingCentral also provides features like call routing,\u00a0call\u00a0forwarding, auto-attendant, and voicemail.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIndeed, this company is very similar to Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM).\u00a0One similarity is that the stock is trading\u00a0sideways,\u00a0much like Zoom has been.\u00a0The pandemic caused companies like Zoom and RingCentral to boom. But as the pandemic started to wane, both companies plunged and have been rangebound.\n\nHowever, I believe this stock represents a solid buying opportunity since it actually\u00a0trades lower than it did\u00a0before the Coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0Companies in this space have excellent growth potential\u00a0going forward. The work-from-home trend is not dead, and with AI and other metaverse trends starting to accelerate, we could see more demand in the coming years for RingCentral and Zoom.\n\nI believe RingCentral has more upside potential of the two since it has been historically more cyclical and\u00a0still is\u00a0expected to grow sales at 8% annually going forward.\u00a0You\u2019re paying just 8.5-times forward earnings for RNG stock. That\u2019s a steal in my books.\n\nBombardier (BDRBF) Image of white paper airplanes on horizontal trajectory with one red paper airplane rising upward, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pasuwan\n\nBombardier (OTCMKTS:BDRBF) is a Canada-based maker of business jets. It designs and sells aircraft and aircraft parts all over the world. It also provides new aircraft, specialized aircraft solutions, and pre-owned aircraft. In addition, Bombardier offers services after the sale, including parts, service centers,\u00a0smart\u00a0services, training, and technical publications.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand has been booming for the company\u2019s business jets, and the\u00a0near-term performance of the stock\u00a0has been stellar.\u00a0As I have said before, Trump\u2019s tax cuts have made it possible for individuals to write off business jets as business expenses.\u00a0This\u00a0has created a boom in that sector\u00a0which\u00a0has continued to drive profits for Bombardier and other private jet companies.\n\nBombardier\u2019s stock is down 5% over the past year,\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0has climbed 53% since October due to its jet demand outperforming expectations.\u00a0The company grew its first-quarter backlog by 5% year-over-year to $14.9 billion, despite global demand for jets cooling down.\n\nJD.Com (JD) the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a building\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany of you may run away from this pick, but I believe it is\u00a0a good\u00a0time to scoop up cheap Chinese stocks. Chinese tech stocks have seen a fire sale over the past couple of months, and I believe it is prime time to buy these stocks at a discount before they take off.\n\nChina\u2019s tech crackdown\u00a0along\u00a0with a slowing\u00a0economy\u00a0caused these stocks to tumble substantially from their peaks. However, with new stimulus measures, the CCP appears to now be more worried about the stock market\u2019s underperformance doing long-term damage to China\u2019s credibility as a place to invest.\n\nI expect further rate cuts in China along with more stimulus measures that should allow JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) and other peer companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) to start growing again. JD is likely bottoming out at these levels.\n\nChina\u2019s e-commerce market\u00a0is still expected\u00a0to grow at a 10.1% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2029, so I have no doubt that JD.Com can restart growth and surprise analysts, given enough time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Chinese tech giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) rose 5.5% over the weekend after it agreed a mapping deal with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in China.\n\nBaidu will offer its Chinese maps to Tesla as it develops full self-driving (FSD), its plan for autonomous vehicle technology. Baidu already offers a car using the feature.\n\nBaidu stock opened trading on April 29 at $104.88. Shares remain down 9% so far in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaidu Stock: A Chinese Tech Star\n\nBefore China\u2019s tech crackdown in 2020, Baidu was one of China\u2019s three largest cloud companies along with Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Baidu was building hyperscale data centers like those of American companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nIts main niche at the time was search, giving it another close Google comparison. It remains China\u2019s dominant search company with 60% of the market.\n\nWhile the tech crackdown has done tremendous damage to Baidu stock, the company remains a global tech player. Last year it launched an AI chatbot called Ernie. It has more AI patents than any other Chinese company.\n\nBaidu has been promising self-driving vehicles even longer than Tesla, but has won more government cooperation than the American company.\n\nIn 2015, a senior Baidu vice president promised self-driving by 2020. In 2022, Baidu launched the Apollo RT6, an autonomous car with a detachable steering wheel. Baidu won a permit to run robotaxis in Beijing last year.\n\nThe deal with Tesla is not unique. Baidu is also working on self-driving with Kia, a unit of Korea\u2019s Hyundai (OCTMKTS:HYMTF).\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Tesla\u2019s deal with China is a two-way street. Baidu will be a global competitor as self-driving technology is rolled out.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a LONG position in GOOGL.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.comPublishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "title": "Got $1,000? 3 Stocks to Buy Now While They're On Sale",
        "content": "There's never really a bad time to buy a good stock. But there are certainly better times than others to step into quality names. That's when they're down for reasons that aren't apt to last.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three stocks to consider buying while they're on sale. Given the growth prospects for each company, their shares are likely to recover sooner rather than later.\n\nUber Technologies\n\nUber Technologies(NYSE: UBER) is the top name in the ride-hailing business -- at least within the United States, where it controls roughly three-fourths of the market.\n\nLaunched as a crowd-sourced, pseudo-taxi service in 2010, the company has mainstreamed the once-weird idea of third-party drivers using their own vehicles to ferry other people around. Last year, it provided over 9.4 billion rides, generating more than $37 billion worth of sales in the process. Perhaps most importantly, Uber turned a little over $1.1 billion of that revenue into net income. Not bad, particularly for a business premise that plenty of people said would never fly.\n\nThe highest-growth days of the ride-hailing market are in the rearview mirror. That doesn't mean there's not more growth in store, though. Market research outfit Technavio expects the worldwide ride-hailing market to grow at an annualized pace of nearly 13% through 2029, jibing with numbers from Straits Research and Acumen Research & Consulting.\n\nWhere the market might be underestimating Uber, however, is on another front. Using its existing technology and network of contracted drivers, Uber is now delivering lots of online restaurant orders through its Uber Eats platform. The company's also getting its feet wet in the same-day retail-delivery arena, picking up and dropping off goods bought from brick-and-mortar stores' shopping websites.\n\nRevenue stemming from this delivery business accounts for roughly 30% of its current top line, in fact, yet this may still only be scratching the surface of this business' potential. IMARC Group believes the same-day logistics market is set to grow by an average of 15% per year through 2032.\n\nUber stock's not been a great performer of late. It's down 16% from March's high, and still knocking on the door of new 52-week lows. Keep it in perspective, though. This pullback is mostly just a cooling off of a very big run-up from October's low. This year's and next year's anticipated revenue growth of more than 16% should turn shares around soon enough. Ever-improving profit margins are bolstering this brewing turnaround.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba\n\nAlibaba(NYSE: BABA) -- often likened to Amazon -- was once on top of the world. The parent to China's online shopping malls Tmall and Taobao was firing on all cylinders. Founder and then-CEO Jack Ma was bigger than life. And investors couldn't get enough of the stock.\n\nAs is so often the case, though, time and size caught up with this company. Alibaba is now scrambling to cut its bloated costs. Layoffs have been heavy, and while neither has happened yet, plans to spin off its cloud computing arm and logistics business are still on the table as cost-culling measures.\n\nChina's economy has also struggled to shake off its pandemic-prompted slump worsened by Beijing's heavy-handed, lingering lockdowns. Let's also not forget that in 2020, Beijing began a brutal regulatory crackdown on most of China's major technology companies. Alibaba was no exception.\n\nAll this combined is why BABA shares are down 77% from their late-2020 peak, trading within sight of multi-year lows. The dry spell has lasted so long that many investors may now be struggling to remember a time when the stock's been worth owning.\n\nThe thing is, this overwhelming pessimism is precisely why now's the time to take your swing. What most investors may not be seeing is that China's slowly but surely working its way out of its economic malaise.\n\nAlthough March's retail spending was disappointing, it was still up 3.1% from a very tough comparison to last March's retail sales surge of 10.6%. The country's first-quarter GDP growth of 5.3% topped expectations of 4.6%, and accelerated from its Q1 pace of 5.2%. Bank of America says China's full-year GDP should grow by 5%, while analysts believe Alibaba's 2024 top line is going to improve on 2023's tally by nearly 9%.\n\nThere's still plenty of work to be done. Investors, however, are underestimating how strong the tailwind is getting, and how much reach Alibaba still has.\n\nDraftKings\n\nLast but not least, add DraftKings(NASDAQ: DKNG) to your list of stocks to buy while they're on sale. OK, it's not a sharply discounted price. DraftKings shares are only down 18% from March's high. But that may be about as cheap as they're going to get. This stock's pullbacks have been relatively short-lived since the beginning of 2023, yielding to the bigger-picture gain that's been underway since then.\n\nDraftKings is one of the U.S.'s most prolific sports betting apps. Started as a fantasy sports platform, it was already well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity created by the Supreme Court's 2018 lifting of the federal sports-wagering ban. Since then, 38 states have officially legalized betting on sports, with 30 of those states permitting this wagering via the internet or a mobile app. More states and new internet-based betting permissions are in the works too, setting the stage for the industry's continued growth.\n\nThat's only part of DraftKings' growth story. The other part is customer cultivation. It takes time to reach and teach customers. And even once they're reached, they're not immediately as profitable as they'll eventually be.\n\nThe company's making progress here. Its per-customer acquisition costs have fallen more than 40% over the course of the past two years, improving gross profit margin rates in the process.\n\nDraftKings also reports that revenue roughly quadruples between the first year and the fourth year its offerings are available within a particular state. These metrics should continue improving the longer the company operates, and the bigger it gets -- and it is getting bigger. This year's projected revenue growth of 31% is just a taste of what's likely waiting for DraftKings shareholders.\n\nThat growth is apt to persist for a long while too.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best e-commerce stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our analysis of the e-commerce and online retail industry, go directly to the 5 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nE-commerce had been steadily on the rise for a while, but with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns worldwide, consumer adoption skyrocketed: year-over-year growth of e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales surged by 1.6 times in China, 3.3 times in the United States, and 4.5 times in the United Kingdom. In the United States, e-commerce sales penetration more than doubled to 35% in 2020 compared to the previous year, a rate of growth typically seen over a decade. With global internet accessibility and usage continuing to rise, with over five billion users worldwide, the number of online shoppers is steadily growing. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) tops the global chart for online retail websites in terms of traffic. The e-commerce behemoth, renowned for its diverse offerings including e-retail, computing services, consumer electronics, and digital content, recorded 6.1 billion direct visits to its .com website in December 2023. On the other hand, in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Asia's largest online commerce provider, takes the lead.\n\nDespite the resurgence of brick-and-mortar shopping, e-commerce is projected to represent 41% of global retail sales by 2027, a significant surge from its 18% share in 2017, according to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group. Based on a global survey conducted in the second quarter of 2023, the study delves into e-commerce trends from the onset of the pandemic to the previous year. The survey included responses from 410 retail and 415 consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies worldwide, with revenues ranging from $50 million to over $10 billion. The respondents from both industries were categorized as \"winners\" (businesses experiencing post-pandemic growth exceeding 30% per annum and anticipating similar or higher growth by 2027) or \"laggards\" (organizations reporting post-Covid growth of 10% or less per annum and expressing uncertainty about their future e-commerce expansion). Among the surveyed companies, winners accounted for 27% of retailers and 20% of CPG companies, while laggards comprised 21% of retailers and 25% of CPG businesses.\n\nSee also: 12 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy.\n\nIn addition, according to speculations by e-commerce company Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), global e-commerce sales are projected to reach $6.3 trillion worldwide in 2024, marking a 9.4% annual increase\u2014the second-highest growth rate between 2021 and 2027. This trend indicates a continued rise in online sales, with projections showing even further expansion. By 2025, global e-commerce sales are forecasted to reach $6.9 trillion, followed by an additional $600 billion increase in 2026 to $7.5 trillion, and eventually surpassing $8 trillion by 2027. A significant trend propelling this expansion in the e-commerce landscape is the increasing prevalence of mobile device usage. Recent data indicates that the number of online shoppers worldwide grew by 8.3% in 2022, reaching 4.11 billion individuals, with nearly 60% of online spending attributed to mobile devices. Mobile commerce sales are expected to continue growing, with total sales from mobile devices projected to reach $2.5 trillion in 2024, up from $2.2 trillion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough consumers are returning to physical stores, e-commerce sales are expected to surpass the $6 trillion mark this year, with 20.1% of all retail sales occurring digitally. In addition, data from Emarketer indicates that excluding China, the global e-commerce share will be 12.4%. In light of this, the robust performance of stocks such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) can serve as a compelling incentive for investors exploring opportunities in the online retail sector. These companies are frequently viewed as among the best e-commerce stocks to invest in currently. 10 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nPachai Leknettip/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best e-commerce stocks to buy according to analysts, we used a stock screener to list down a number of e-commerce stocks, ranking the firms by their average analyst share price target upside.\n\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 10.53%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $183.62\n\nTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT), an American retail corporation headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, operates a chain of discount department stores and hypermarkets. The majority of its e-commerce net sales are generated within the United States. Target.com, the company\u2019s online platform, offers a diverse range of products spanning various categories, including Hobby & Leisure, Fashion, and Electronics.\n\nOn March 13, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) announced a quarterly dividend of $1.10, payable by June 10 to the shareholders of record on May 15. As of April 14, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.67%.\n\nAs of the end of December 2023, 58 out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had invested in the company. The largest shareholder of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is Ric Dillon\u2019s Diamond Hill Capital through its $401 million investment.\n\nMuch like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) ranks as one of the best e-commerce stocks to buy.\n\n9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 11.85%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $308.67\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a financial services firm that provides debit cards, credit cards, and associated services. Visa (NYSE:V) distinguishes itself in the e-commerce realm with its robust global payment network, which underpins secure and swift online transactions.\n\nOn January 27, investment advisory firm Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock and elevated the price target to $319 from $304.\n\nFor their fourth quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 162 out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had bought and owned Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\u2019s shares. Chris Hohn\u2019s TCI Fund Management owned the biggest stake that was worth $4.3 billion.\n\n8. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 12.82%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $210.00\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a prominent American multinational technology company, encompasses a diverse range of business interests, including e-commerce, cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The company's e-commerce platform offers a wide array of products, including gourmet food, groceries, apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, and more.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database, which monitors 933 elite hedge funds, reveals a positive sentiment towards Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Q4. The number of hedge funds with investments in the stock rose to 293, up from 286 in the previous quarter.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMy previous analysis (Q4 2022 letter) highlighted the significant growth in\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment expenses since 2015, masking the true earnings potential of its retail business. Though initially costly, the recent restructuring into regional fulfillment centers has yielded lower fulfillment costs and faster shipping times, leading to increased purchase frequency, especially among Prime members.\n\nFollowing the regionalization effort, over the last couple of years, Amazon prioritized cost control and reduced capital expenditures. At a high level, the North American segment\u2019s operating income swung from a $240 million loss in 2022 to a healthy $6.4 billion profit (6% margin) in 2023. Combined with continued strength in AWS and advertising, Amazon\u2019s free cash flow (as reported, excluding equipment finance leases and principal repayments) surged from negative $13 billion to positive $36 billion.\n\nAmazon stands out for pioneering the public market strategy of prioritizing long-term growth through sustained low margins and reinvestment, with the ability to later \u201cturn on the taps\u201d for profit. While many public tech companies have tried to replicate this approach, Amazon\u2019s scale and execution capabilities make it one of the few that have successfully pulled it off.\u201d\n\n7. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 14.05%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $76.47\n\nEtsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), headquartered in Brooklyn, New York, operates two-sided online marketplaces connecting millions of creative buyers and sellers worldwide. Its primary marketplace, Etsy, focuses on unique and creative goods, and the company also oversees Reverb, Depop, and Elo7. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)\u2019s marketplaces have approximately 8.8 million active sellers and over 97 million active buyers.\n\nAccording to the Insider Monkey Database, 36 out of the 933 tracked hedge funds held stakes in Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) as of the end of the fourth quarter. Bares Capital Management remained the most significant stockholder with stakes worth $330.71 million.\n\n6. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 17.01%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $82.84\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stands as a pivotal provider of internet infrastructure for commerce, equipping businesses with tools to launch, expand, promote, and manage retail operations across various magnitudes. With its platform and services utilized by millions of businesses spanning 175 countries, Shopify plays an instrumental role in supporting a diverse spectrum of enterprises.\n\nIn its analysis of 933 hedge fund holdings for Q4 2023, Insider Monkey unearthed 68 investments in the firm. Notably, the largest investor in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) among these is Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell\u2019s Arrowstreet Capital, holding 20.9 million shares valued at $1.6 billion.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its 2023 annual investor letter:\n\n\"Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is an all-in-one e-commerce platform that empowers businesses of all sizes to build, manage, and grow their online stores. Founded in 2006, Shopify now holds a commanding >10% market share in US e-commerce.\n\nThe value of Shopify lies in its simplicity for merchants to easily start and scale their business, so much so that merchants fall in love with their solutions and never want to leave, no matter how big they get. They understand that as they grow and confront new challenges, Shopify will solve their problems so they can take their business to the next level. That is the power of Shopify's flywheel.\n\nWe have owned Shopify\u2019s stock since 2022. Our average cost basis is $60. Following our purchase, the stock hit a low of $26 in October 2022. Just 15 months following those lows, Shopify stock is now trading at $80 (a 200% rebound) as investors celebrated the decision to sell its capital intensive logistics business, which was largely expected to cost billions of dollars to build out \u2014 a move that enables Shopify to retain its original, asset-light business model. Additionally, while many tech companies struggled in the face of macroeconomic challenges, Shopify defied expectations by maintaining robust revenue growth in 2023. Revenue increased by 25% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, with gross profit growing by a healthy 36%. We are now sitting on a +35% unrealized gain on our position after owning the stock for almost 2 years. Not a bad return, but what a wild ride it has been. Just another example that volatility is the price of admission in this business.\"\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) joins the ranks of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) as one of the best e-commerce stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks 11 Best Italian Stocks To Invest In 2024 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Alibaba\u2019s Risky Gamble: Can the E-Commerce Titan Bounce Back from Its Missteps?",
        "content": "Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is an example of a stock that took its eye off the ball and struck out big. Now it is scrambling to regain its footing. Alibaba\u2019s ongoing restructuring has failed to win over the market, resulting in a 9% year-to-date decline in its stock, a 22% decline over the last 12 months, and a more than 31% drop from its 52-week high.\n\nAlthough founder Jack Ma endorsed the Chinese online retailer\u2019s turnaround plans, investors might not want to rush in. Alibaba is a behemoth. Righting the ship is going to take time.\n\nA Closer Look at Alibaba Stock\n\nTrying to be all things to all people doesn\u2019t always pan out, especially under China\u2019s political system. It\u2019s the problem of trying to run a capitalist business in a communist economy. The two are often at odds and the government doesn\u2019t like to be shown up.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba ran into that during the pandemic when Ma criticized regulators for stifling innovation. They came after the e-commerce giant hard. Ma was called before the regulators, an anti-monopoly probe was launched into Alibaba, and Ma\u2019s Ant Financial had its much-anticipated IPO scrapped. Ma went into hiding.\n\nOthers found out the hard way as well. Chinese property developer Ren Zhiqiang made the mistake of referring to President Xi Jinping as a \u201cclown.\u201d He ended up being charged and convicted of corruption before getting sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n\nYou\u2019re always operating with one eye looking over your shoulder. That may have been what kept Alibaba from seeing the competition coming.\n\nJuggling Too Many Plates\n\nAlibaba has its fingers in a lot of pies. It has replicated the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recipe of offering logistics services, local consumer services, digital media and entertainment.\n\nThere is also Alibaba Health, an on and offline healthcare products and services business; Alibaba Cloud, its cloud computing division; and Global Digital Commerce, where it operates marketplaces like Lazada and Aliexpress in various international markets.\n\nThese far-flung businesses require a lot of time and attention that Alibaba apparently couldn\u2019t spare. Its primary e-commerce operations fell behind PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), which runs Temu and Pinduoduo. PDD took from Alibaba the title of China\u2019s most valuable online-retail company.\n\nByteDance\u2018s Douyin video platform is transforming into a viable e-commerce platform and is growing faster than either Alibaba or JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). Alibaba Cloud is the online retailer\u2019s second biggest revenue source, but suffered outages at the end of 2022 that affected large swaths of the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba attempted to spin off a number of its units into standalone businesses, but most of those ended up getting canceled. Most recently it scrapped its logistics business IPO due to unfavorable market conditions.\n\nA New Direction\n\nThe e-commerce giant now has a new CEO, Eddie Wu, who will direct Alibaba\u2019s focus back to its bread-and-butter operations. It is focusing on offering consumers low prices again and will use its market-leading position in artificial intelligence to improve offerings throughout all of its businesses.\n\nIt was this restructuring that Ma endorsed. He said it was important for Alibaba stock for the company to admit the mistakes it had made in the past, but to also move past them for the future.\n\n\u201cThis year, amid the many doubts and pressures on the company internally and externally, I saw the birth of a strong and brave Alibaba team,\u201d Ma wrote to company employees.\n\nThose doubts and pressures still exist. Admitting there is a problem is only the first step towards redemption. Alibaba still needs to pull it off. Until it shows concrete results, investors should not full embrace the retailer\u2019s stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned -1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has lost 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share, indicating a change of -23.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. This estimate has changed -9.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.29 indicates a change of -1.2% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $130.77 billion and $139.99 billion estimates indicate +3.7% and +7.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $36.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.46%. The EPS surprise was -2.2%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "10 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 undervalued cyclical stocks to invest in according to analysts. To skip the detailed analysis of current market conditions and cyclical stocks, go directly to the 5 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts.\n\nThe stocks that follow the patterns of the economy are known as cyclical stocks. Investors usually prefer these stocks during robust economic conditions and ignore them during downturns. However, this is just a general definition and every economic cycle is different. For example, energy is usually considered a cyclical sector, yet it was the best-performing sector in 2022 when inflation reached record highs, averaging 8% in 2022. By the end of the year, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) had gained nearly 58% while the S&P 500 experienced its worst year since 2008, declining by 18.1%.\n\nIn 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the S&P 500 had a tremendous run, gaining nearly 25%, and 11%, respectively. However, we have been recently seeing some signs of correction as it has declined by over 4.6% month-to-date on April 18. The conflicts in the Middle East and higher-for-longer interest rates leading to US treasury bonds reaching their 6-month highs of 4.67 % on April 16, may lead some cautious investors to opt for some low-volatility or counter-cyclical stocks. Nevertheless, the strong earnings season and easing inflation could prove to be beneficial for the more cyclical stocks.\n\nGlobal Growth Forecasts Raised\n\nDespite the recent declines in the market, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes that the global economy is still showing resilience. On April 16, it raised its global growth forecasts by 0.3% from October levels. The IMF now predicts global growth to be 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, similar to the levels experienced in 2023. It believes in \u201cstronger activity\u201d from the U.S., China, and other large emerging markets. Nevertheless, weaker activity is predicted in the Euro area. Furthermore, the IMF predicts the median inflation to come down to 2.8% by the end of 2024 and 2.4% in 2025, compared to 4% by the end of 2023.\n\nPerformance of Our Prior Cyclical Recommendations\n\nWe previously provided a list of the best cyclical stocks on November 2, 2023, and our top two stock picks were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Both of these companies have outperformed the broader market between November 2 and April 18 and also on a year-to-date basis. Since November 2, 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is up nearly 30% and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is 35% higher, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 16% gains. On a year-to-date basis, the former is up over 19.5% and the latter has gained nearly 24% on April 18. Furthermore, analysts are still highly bullish on both these stocks and believe in significant upside potential for both.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been covered by 42 Wall Street analysts and all of them rate the stock a Buy. Their average price target of $212.36 shows an 18% upside from its current levels on April 18. On April 18, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria maintained a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock with a $235 price target. The analyst believes that the company's expansion plans look promising with plans to add 45 million square feet of new space this year, focusing on delivery and fulfillment centers, especially in California and Phoenix. This expansion, along with increased delivery stations, strengthens Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) competitive position against USPS, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX). The investment management firm, Polen Capital, also believes in the company and predicted significant margin expansion in its first quarter 2024 investor letter. The firm made the following comments:\n\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is our largest position. Much of our investment thesis is based on solid and durable earnings growth from its three biggest businesses (e-commerce, AWS, and advertising) and disciplined expense management that has supported robust margin expansion and earnings growth. It was only about a year ago that Amazon\u2019s margins bottomed at 1.9%. They are now back to roughly 8%, and we think they can expand significantly.\u201d\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was covered by 26 analysts over the last three months and 23 of them maintain a Buy-equivalent rating on the company and the average analyst price target shows a 14% upside at the time of writing on April 18. On April 11, JPMorgan resumed coverage of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) with an Overweight rating and raised its price target to $140 from $120. The firm acknowledged challenges such as declining pay TV subscribers and advertising difficulties faced by the company\u2019s traditional business segments,\u00a0but suggests that the company can navigate these hurdles through substantial cost restructuring efforts, especially within its linear networks. The Walt Disney Company\u2019s (NYSE:DIS) CEO, Bob Igor, is also very optimistic about the future of the company and made the following comments at its latest earnings call:\n\n\u201cJust one year ago, we outlined an ambitious plan to return to a period of sustained growth and shareholder value creation, and our strong performance in this past quarter demonstrates that we have turned the corner and entered a new era. As previously noted, we're focused on transitioning ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, building streaming into a profitable growth business, reinvigorating our film studios, and turbocharging growth in our parks and experiences.\u201d\n\nEven though the market saw some pullback in recent days, experts still believe that these minor corrections do not significantly define the broader view of the market and are still bullish. For such conditions, some of the most undervalued cyclical stocks to invest in according to analysts include ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). 10 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scoured through the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to find stocks in all the cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary, energy, financials, and materials, and more, with price-earning ratios of under 15 and market capitalization of over $10 billion. Next, we shortlisted our list to 25 stocks with Buy or better ratings and further narrowed down our list to 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price targets on April 18. The analyst ratings were taken from TipRanks and the stocks are listed in ascending order of their average price target upside potential.\n\nHedge fund sentiment around each stock has also been added. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts\n\n10.

Commodity prices are inherently uncertain, but we continue to view ALB-as a winner in this growing industry and favorably positioned on the cost curve. Our long- term view of ALB is not affected by short-term supply- demand dynamics for the commodity.\u201d\n\n9. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)\n\nPE ratio as of April 18: 13.18\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 35.46%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 45\n\nMGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is an owner and operator of casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts.

Casino and online gaming company MGM saw double-digit revenue growth and strong 2023 bookings in Las Vegas in the first half, which moderated in the second half but remained solid. A cybersecurity attack negatively impacted 3Q results, but MGM does not expect the $100 million hit to have a material effect on its financial condition and operational results for the year.

        "title": "Alibaba Is Counting on These 2 Strategies to Regain Its Glory. Can It Pay Off for Investors?",
        "content": "Once an investor darling, Alibaba Group(NYSE: BABA) has fallen from grace. A series of challenges, such as the crackdown by the Chinese government, slower growth, and a massive management shuffle, have left shareholders in confusion and disappointment.\n\nStill, the tech giant has not given up on its turnaround efforts, and the appointment of the new management team could get the company back on track. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRecapturing the hearts of its end users\n\nMost investors identify Alibaba as the biggest e-commerce company in China, serving a country of more than 1.4 billion people via its flagship Taobao and Tmall apps. Many also know that the tech giant expanded into other areas like cloud computing, fintech, and logistics.\n\nHowever, few know that Alibaba began as a cross-border business-to-business platform, helping Chinese merchants sell their manufactured products to overseas customers, who then sell these products in their markets (such as the U.S. and Europe). In fact, Alibaba's mission to make it easy to do business anywhere originated from this early venture.\n\nAlibaba's approach to its Chinese e-commerce business, which it set up a few years later, was very similar to its earlier venture -- which was to help merchants sell their products online -- but this time the focus is local consumers. That approach was successful because it solved supply issues by making a wide selection of goods available online. So, although end consumers benefited from that effort, they weren't Alibaba's primary focus then.\n\nYet Alibaba's focus on merchants meant that it has not paid enough attention to the needs of end users. That neglect allowed latecomers like Pinduoduo to fill the gap. Besides, the rapid development of the e-commerce industry in China also led to a complete change in the supply and demand equation, where the bottleneck has now shifted to the demand side. That shift was costly to Alibaba as its edge had been in solving the pain points on the supply side.\n\nFortunately, Alibaba (and its new management team) has recognized these shortcomings and committed to putting end users first to rekindle growth. The team is focused on improving critical aspects such as providing customers with low prices, making Taobao a universal and all-inclusive app and leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to build the next-generation e-commerce platform. It has also entirely replaced its e-commerce business's leadership team, which reports directly to Eddie Wu, the new CEO.\n\nIn short, Alibaba is shifting its attention to remain a relevant player in the competitive e-commerce industry in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeveraging AI for the future\n\nOne of the biggest trends in recent years is the artificial intelligence revolution, which has transformed our world at an unprecedented pace (and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future). For example, the proliferation of generative AI services -- the most popular being ChatGPT -- has demonstrated how AI could impact businesses and individuals.\n\nThere will be winners and losers as companies navigate this new era of change, the former actively embracing the latest technology and the latter being unwilling to adapt. Alibaba aims to be the former group, leveraging AI to redefine its prospects.\n\nTake its cloud computing business, Alibaba Cloud, for example. It is well positioned to benefit from the pent-up demand for computing power and data storage capacity needed for companies to train and operate their AI models. As the most significant player in China with a 39% market share, Alibaba Cloud has the economies of scale to provide these services at low costs.\n\nThe cloud provider can provide AI to help companies scale up their AI infrastructure. For example, companies can leverage Alibaba Cloud's customizable generative AI models to help them build, train, and operate their purposed-built AI tools -- such as AI bots, image and text generators. These new services could kick-start Alibaba Cloud's revenue growth again, which was just 3% in the nine months ending Dec 31, 2023.\n\nLikewise, AI will help Alibaba improve its e-commerce business. For instance, Alibaba can leverage AI to improve customer experience in areas like personalization, which will help it improve the overall shopping experience. On the merchant front, Alibaba can provide AI-enabled tools to help them better serve consumers' needs and improve their productivity, such as by using AI tools to write product descriptions and generate images.\n\nAlibaba is betting heavily on AI to return to its historical growth trajectory. To this end, it has the resources -- massive data sets, plenty of cash, and access to the latest technology -- to help it develop an edge in AI in the coming years.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nLike most companies, Alibaba has made mistakes that impacted its competitive edge.\u00a0However, the tech giant's management has recognized its shortcomings and is working to get back on track. It also aims to leverage AI to help reach new heights.\n\nInvestors should closely monitor the company's progress across these two fronts in the coming quarters.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "15 Fastest Declining Countries in Asia",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 fastest declining countries in Asia. If you want to skip our discussion on the population trends in Asia, you can go directly to the 5 Fastest Declining Countries in Asia.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region is home to a population of over 4.8 billion people as of 2020. The region is home to China and India, which are the two most populous countries in the world, with over 1.4 billion people each. According to recent data from the United Nations (UN), the region's population is growing by 0.64% per year, but this growth rate is slowing down. The composition of the total population is expected to shift in the future due to different speeds of population growth in the subregions. For instance, in 1980, 42% of the region's population lived in East and North-East Asia, but by 2050, only 31% of the population will live there. Instead, almost half of the region's population will live in South and South-West Asia by 2050. The Pacific is the fastest-growing subregion, and its share of the total population is expected to grow from 0.8% in 1980 to 1.1% in 2050.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that despite having a shrinking population with negative or bare minimum population growth, several countries in our list of the fastest declining countries in Asia are also among the top 10 fastest growing economies in Asia. These include China and Armenia. Despite efforts to control population growth, economic activity in these countries continues to boom. This is primarily because the total population in these areas still remains substantial, providing a large labor force and consumer base to drive economic growth.\n\nChina is the fastest-growing Asian country based on GDP. However, due to strict policies for population growth, including the one-child policy in the past, the Chinese population has seen a major decline in recent years. This decline was first noticed in 2022, when there was a difference of 850,000 in the Chinese population from the previous year. This marked the first population decline in the country in over 60 years. The one-child policy was lifted in 2016 and replaced by a two-child policy.\n\nHowever, with the passage of time, Chinese authorities have had a shift in opinion about restrictions on fertility and reproduction and are encouraging people to get married and have more kids. This is because around 15% of the country\u2019s population is aged 65 or older, and the fertility rate stands at 1.45 children per woman. A stable population requires a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman, which China falls short of. According to the French Institute for Demographic Studies, if no changes occur, the Chinese population will drop to 1.3 billion by 2050 and may further decrease to less than 800 million in 2100.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan and South Korea are facing similar challenges. Japan and South Korea\u2019s population is decreasing rapidly every year. The fertility rates in both countries are low, with South Korea having 1.1 children per woman and Japan having 1.4 children per woman. The future looks concerning, with Japan's population expected to decrease to 104 million in 2050 and then to 72 million in 2100 from the current 126 million. Japan witnessed a record decline in 2023, with a staggering decrease of 837,000 people within a year. This roughly translates to losing 100 people an hour. Despite efforts to encourage high fertility, Japan has struggled to reverse its declining population growth since 2005. The government has expressed concerns about the impact of low fertility on its economy and social welfare systems.\n\nIn South Korea's case, the figures are expected to drop from 52 million today to 46 million in 2050 and then to 24 million in 2100. The primary cause for this drop in fertility rates and population growth rates is urbanization and modernization. This declining population trend is common in most high-income countries across the globe. This is because urbanization leads to long working hours and high living costs, which discourage people from starting families.\n\nDespite experiencing recent declines in population, some of the countries in Asia are projected to play important roles in the global economy in the future as well. For instance, China is forecasted to capture a significant share of 22.68% and achieve a GDP of $101 trillion by 2100. The Chinese economy is supported by various companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD). Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) offer two of the most popular e-commerce platforms in China. Meanwhile, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) operates as a multimedia company.\n\nHere's what Artisan Partners said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPretty much all of our holdings rose during the quarter. Only one stock declined by more than a couple of percent\u2014Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), which was down 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. This investment continues to be a disappointment. We estimate the shares are trading at around 5X EBITA\u2014a valuation normally reserved for a company with evaporating profits. While it\u2019s true Alibaba is underperforming its peers in the market, the fact is it remains the market leader in its core businesses, and the business is still growing. In the most recent quarter, revenues grew 9% and profits grew 26%. It\u2019s not evaporating.\n\nThe management seems to be making meaningful changes designed to enhance shareholder value, including structural changes to improve profitability and restore its competitive position. It is monetizing non-core assets and making improvements in capital allocation. A lot of good things are happening that are not yet recognized in the share price. There are reasons\u2014primarily geopolitical\u2014for this, but at the current valuation, we could easily see the shares double and they would still be cheap.\u201d 15 Fastest Declining Countries in Asia\n\nchristian-joudrey-9bdt03k4ujw-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the fastest declining countries in Asia, we consulted high-authority sources such as the World Bank, the United Nations, and the CIA. We used these sources to gather the latest population data for Asian countries and shortlisted 15 countries with declining population growth rates. All countries in this list have a population growth rate lower than the world average population growth rate. The countries are ranked in descending order of their annual population growth rate as of 2022, sourced from the World Bank. It is important to note that while some of these countries have positive population growth rates, they are still observing a decline in their total population as compared to previous years.\n\nYou can also check out the 50 Most Populated Countries in the World in 2024 here.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Olympics-Games' broadcaster embracing AI but remains wary of deepfakes",
        "content": "By Richa Naidu\n\nLONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - As part of a push by the International Olympic Committee to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) in Paris, the Games' broadcaster is stepping up its use of the technology -- but not without concerns about the risk of \"deepfakes\".\n\nOlympic Broadcasting Services (OBS), which produces the live television, radio and digital coverage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games that is then sold to clients, first began using AI at the PyeongChang Winter Games in 2018.\n\n\"In Paris we will take this to a completely different level,\" Yiannis Exarchos, OBS chief executive, told Reuters at an event in London on Friday to discuss the role AI will play at the Paris 2024 Games.\n\n\"There are a variety of applications, primarily to do with enhancing the experience of the viewer, but also creating significant efficiencies in the way we operate.\"\n\nExarchos said OBS had teamed up with Chinese retail giant and Olympic sponsor Alibaba to use AI for 360-degree assisted replays. It is also working with Swiss watchmaker Omega, the official timekeeper of the Paris Games, for \"enhanced data...whether that's additional explanations generated by AI or following athletes.\"\n\nOBS is also working with chip maker Intel to generate fast, AI-originated highlights. \"The Olympics has a huge amount of content so our broadcasters will be able to generate very, very fast highlights of different events per country, per athlete, per sport, per mood, and customize the experience for the audience whether it is traditional television or social,\" Exarchos said.\n\nAs use of AI continues to expand globally, deepfake technology to create digital fabrications has followed.\n\nDeepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness using AI techniques. They are usually extremely realistic, making it hard to distinguish between real and manipulated media.\n\nThis can and has led to impersonation, fraud, blackmail and the spread of misinformation and propaganda.\n\nWhen asked if he was worried that enhancing video could lead to fakes, Exarchos said he was very concerned about \"tampering with reality\" and was focused on protecting against deepfakes.\n\n\"We need to fully protect the integrity of competition... that would be a risk for sports,\" said Exarchos, who has led OBS since 2012.\n\nThe service's broadcasting clients include some of the biggest media companies in the world, including NBC.\n\n\"They (OBS's clients) recognize this risk exists... they are taking a number of measures to protect the Olympic content from any such possibilities,\" Exarchos added.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The concerns that fans have is very legitimate. I am a huge believer in the possibilities of technology but precisely because I understand how technology can be wrong, I think we all need to be vigilant. We need to go to trusted sources to get our information.\n\n\"In the Olympics we fully protect the authenticity of the video, so we do not tamper with it,\" Exarchos said, adding that the protection and management of the IOC-owned content is \"of utmost importance.\" (Reporting by Richa Naidu; Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "12 Best Diversified Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best diversified stocks to invest in. To know more about the top stocks, go directly to 5 Best Diversified Stocks To Invest In.\n\nForbes asked a group of experts about the changing global landscape and its effect on investors. These experts included Justin Onuekwusi (JO), Kasim Zafar (KZ), and EQ Investors. They discussed the impact of rising geopolitical tensions on investors in 2024 and shed light on the significance of geographic diversification. The US presidential elections can also introduce uncertainty into the markets, especially if the outcome is uncertain or if there's a perception that it could significantly alter economic policies. Diversification remains a key strategy for investors to mitigate the risks associated with such geopolitical uncertainties. By spreading investments across different geographic regions, asset classes, and industries, investors can potentially reduce the impact of any single event or market downturn on their overall portfolio.\n\nInvestment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has gained momentum, especially because of diversification. It has opened many opportunities for numerous investors that enable them to make informed decisions based on current market conditions. ETFs hold a collection of securities that offer investors benefit of immediate diversification by spreading investment across multiple assets. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) is one of the popular ETF that aims to replicate the performance of the entire S&P 500 index with low annual fees of only 30 cents against a $1000 investment. Moving forward, substantial potential for growth and innovation in ETF space is expected due to its ability to allow investors to tailor investments to their financial goals and risk levels. ETFs are traded on a stock exchange, unlike its chief rival mutual funds among retail investors. According to Morningstar, investors withdrew over $900 billion from mutual funds in 2022 and funneled about $600 billion into ETFs and PwC anticipates total global ETF assets could exceed $20 trillion by 2026. If you are a beginner investor, investing in ETFs is a good idea because you will generate the average performance of the market in your portfolio. If you'd like to generate higher than average returns, you need to identify stocks with large upside potential. Sites like Insider Monkey is a good starting point to identify such stocks. For example, hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here) and Insider Monkey shares the list of these stocks periodically.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an era where investors are predisposed to geopolitical unrest because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing power rivalry between US and China, it is imperative to adopt more diversified and flexible investment strategies. Diversification is a viable option for investors to help insulate portfolios, especially during times of economic recession and geopolitical unrest.\n\nWarren Buffett, in his recent annual letter, mentioned that his sprawling conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway possesses the largest net worth among all American businesses, amounting to around 6% of the combined net worth of all S&P 500 companies. The conglomerate\u2019s stock has surged approximately 16% in 2024, more than double the S&P 500\u2019s return, following a similar 16% increase in 2023 and the market value has gone up to $900 billion. Warren Buffett\u2019s investment philosophy is against the common practice of over diversification. He has emphasized enough on the importance of quality over quantity in investment choices and suggested a deep conviction and understanding of a few chosen companies for significant health creation.\n\nLooking forward to 2025, investors, in view of diversification, may allocate funds to assets such as bonds, Public Provident Fund, gold, real estate and bank deposits that are more secure investment alternatives. The 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds needs to be modernized as the unprecedented spike in inflation and interest rates in 2022 clobbered stocks and bonds. Therefore, investors might contemplate reallocating 10% portion from 60% of which is allocated for stocks to secure asset classes offering higher yields such as banks are offering 5% to 5.5% on high yield accounts.\n\nAnalysts have predicted continued acceleration in S&P 500 earnings, forecasting 3.9% year-over-year growth in Q1, followed by a further increase of 9% in Q2 of 2024. And a substantial growth of 20.8% in earnings has been witnessed in the technology sector, driven by the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a remarkable increase of 265% in revenue for Q4.\n\nSome of the best diversified stocks to invest in based on hedge funds\u2019 assessments are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). For this, we decided to take a look the 12 best diversified stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the best diversified stocks to invest in, we filtered companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq having multiple product lines and several revenue streams.

        "content": "Joe Tsai, Co-Founder of Alibaba, Says That There's A 'Wealth Effect' From Property Downturn\n\nAlibaba co-founder Joe Tsai said that he's noticed that a wealth effect from a property downturn tends to make consumers more hesitant to spend their money \u2014 here's why.\n\nIn an interview with Norges Bank Investment Management, Tsai spoke about all things wealth, including consumer confidence during property downturns. He provided context on the Chinese economy, explaining that it makes up about 31% of global production, but its consumers participate in around 14% of global consumption. Compared to the U.S., with consumption over 70% in the global economy, Tsai feels that \"Chinese consumers need to come into more significance and rival that of Western developed markets.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nTsai explained that when the housing market experiences a property downturn, it can erode consumer confidence, especially if money and investments are tied up in that property. The wealthy spend less because they don't feel as wealthy. Tsai claims that average property prices have come down by 30% in China, which can be scary for real estate property investors and consumers.\n\nIn contrast, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that median sale prices for U.S. homes reached record highs in February 2024. Home prices are rising faster than people\u2019s wages and mortgage rates have reached 23-year highs. According to data from Realtors.com's 2024 housing market report, rates have increased by 2.9%.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. housing market fewer people were buying houses. Rising house prices, high mortgage rates and a lack of supply were major contributors. As the U.S. tries to avoid a recession, interest rates will probably remain high. People fear that a crash in the housing market is imminent, although experts say that a lack of inventory makes a drop unlikely.\n\nRick Arvielo of New American Funding said, \"You're not going to see house prices decline. There's just not enough inventory.\"\n\nTsai said that young people worry more about getting jobs than purchasing property. He explains that this fear is real. He points out that his own company is not hiring and that he believes people are not certain of their future stability, especially college graduates.\n\nTsai explains that while Chinese citizens have high savings and household cash is strong, consumer confidence is low. In the U.S., consumer confidence can be influenced by the general elections in November. Depending on the outcome of the elections, consumer confidence could improve or decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?

        "content": "While you should never invest based on any one metric or person\u2019s guidance, a possible exception can be made for Michael Burry stocks. Granted, you still need to conduct your own due diligence. Still, the reclusive hedge fund manager tends to win big with his contrarian trades.\n\nOf course, we all know Burry from his exploits featured in the book and film \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d However, the investment genius \u2013 who also holds a medical degree from Vanderbilt \u2013 has made many other picks as well. Indeed, he was investing in meme stocks before that term even materialized. In other words, he knows how to read the market.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to say that he\u2019s 100% correct \u2013 no one has that kind of record. However, he definitely knows his stuff. Below are several Michael Burry stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nBased on the latest 13F disclosure documents, technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) represents 5.2% of the hedge fund manager\u2019s portfolio. Now, whether it ranks as one of the Michael Burry stocks or not, GOOGL is a compelling enterprise. Primarily, its ownership of the internet through its Google search engine (along with the ecosystem) makes Alphabet a formidable investment.\n\nTo be sure, GOOGL probably won\u2019t make you rich overnight. However, it\u2019s a solid idea for the long haul thanks to its consistency. Last fiscal year, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.7%. Its best performance was in the first quarter, when it posted earnings per share of $1.17 against a target of $1.07.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are targeting EPS of $6.82, a significant bump from last year\u2019s result of $5.80. On the top line, they\u2019re looking at revenue of $342.8 billion, up 11.4%. In fairness, GOOGL is a bit pricey at 6.39X trailing-year revenue. Still, it carries a strong buy rating with a high-side price target of $185.\n\nCitigroup (C) The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.\n\nSource: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn intriguing idea among Michael Burry stocks, Citigroup (NYSE:C) makes up 5.4% of the hedge fund manager\u2019s portfolio. The financial sector has operated under a skeptical cloud considering last year\u2019s regional banking crisis. However, the series of better-than-expected jobs reports could favor the major financial institutions. More people having jobs means that rate hikes might not be coming soon, potentially improving lenders\u2019 profitability.\n\nCitigroup in particular has benefited from its consistent performance. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 17.4%. Notably, the company\u2019s Q1 print was impressive, producing EPS of $1.58 against a consensus view of $1.23.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are now looking at EPS of $5.77. That\u2019s a solid improvement over last year\u2019s print of $5.52. On the top line, revenue could hit $80.41 billion, up 11.2% from 2023\u2019s tally of $72.32 billion. Also, the high-side sales estimate calls for $81.2 billion.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s worth noting that Citigroup offers a forward yield of 3.72%.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOperating under the infrastructure software industry, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments worldwide. It\u2019s one of the Michael Burry stocks possibly due to underlying artificial intelligence investments. Oracle\u2019s cloud service is incorporate generative AI to offer utility across a wide range of use cases.\n\nRight now, ORCL represents 5.6% of Burry\u2019s portfolio. Admittedly, it\u2019s not the most exciting idea in terms of financial performances. However, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 3.23% in the past four quarters.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS of $5.59, above last year\u2019s result of $5.12. On the revenue front, they believe the company is capable of ringing up $53.25 billion. That\u2019s up 6.6% from last year\u2019s haul of $49.95 billion. Notably, for fiscal 2025, the consensus projection calls for sales of $57.7 billion.\n\nOverall, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $138.61 price target, implying almost 17% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

Some would also call the company controversial for effectively dominating the business landscape, putting smaller companies out of business. Still, Wall Street isn\u2019t a place to make friends. It\u2019s also one of the Michael Burry stocks, representing 4.8% of his portfolio.\n\nWhile AMZN is no longer the exciting new tech name to speculate on, it still offers tremendous relevance. Perhaps most notably, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales has steadily increased since Q2 2022. That\u2019s despite the consumer headwinds of inflation and elevated borrowing costs. So, that puts Amazon in the driver\u2019s seat. Last fiscal year, its average positive earnings surprise shot up to 55.15%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.13 on revenue of $641.35 billion. That\u2019s a notable improvement across the board compared to last year\u2019s results of $2.90 EPS on sales of $574.78 billion. To no one\u2019s shock, experts rate AMZN a unanimous strong buy.\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (SBLK) a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean representing TOPS stock\n\nSource: VladSV / Shutterstock.com\n\nA shipping company, Star Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) engages in the ocean transportation of dry bulk cargoes worldwide. Per the company\u2019s public profile, its vessels transport a range of bulk commodities, including iron ores, minerals and grains, bauxite, fertilizers and steel products. Should the global economy improve, SBLK could be one of the top-performing Michael Burry stocks.\n\nRight now, SBLK stock represents 4.9% of Burry\u2019s portfolio. Given the reclusive market expert\u2019s penchant for thought-provoking tweets (often with a downcast tone), the acquisition of Star Bulk is a curious one. Last fiscal year, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 7%. However, the performance is volatile, badly missing in Q2 while knocking it out of the park in Q1 and Q3.\n\nLooking ahead to end of fiscal 2024, analysts see EPS of $4.04. That\u2019s a significant increase from last year\u2019s result of $1.84. Also, the top line could expand 6.3% to $1.01 billion. And in the following year, revenue could hit $1.12 billion, implying nearly 11% up from projected 2024 sales.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Chinese e-commerce company, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) represents one of the two massive business-to-consumer online retailers in China by transaction volume and revenue. However, there are concerns about the underlying market\u2019s economy. As a result, JD stock suffered a decline of almost 8% since the beginning of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s down more than 33%.\n\nStill, I would classify JD.com as more of a classic example of Michael Burry stocks. Should China\u2019s economy perform better than expected, JD could rise substantially. Providing some hope for this narrative is the company\u2019s earnings performance last year. In the past four quarters, it posted an average positive earnings surprise of 20.13%. That\u2019s impressive.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $3.16, a solid improvement over last year\u2019s print of $3.06. Revenue may land at $160.13 billion, up 6.9% from 2023\u2019s tally of $149.84 billion. Experts also peg JD stock a moderate buy with a $37.97 price target, implying 51% upside potential.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother Chinese e-commerce and technology juggernaut, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is essentially its home nation\u2019s flagship enterprise. Invariably, then, it commands much attention from Wall Street. It also happens to be the top idea for Michael Burry stocks. Right now, it represents 6.1% of the investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\nFundamentally, it\u2019s another classic example of what Burry typically targets: underappreciated ideas with significant upside potential. However, prospective investors face notable challenges. In particular, BABA stock suffered a loss of 8% since the start of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, it has lost 28% of equity value. Whether it recovers depends of course on the trajectory of the Chinese economy.\n\nWith that in mind, the company provides some encouragement with generally solid performances. In the last fiscal year, its average positive earnings surprise came out to 8.38%. For the current year, analysts are seeking EPS of $8.64 on revenue of $130 billion. That\u2019s a solid improvement from last year\u2019s results of $7.64 EPS on sales of $121.63 billion.\n\nFinally, analysts rate BABA a strong buy with a $104.49 price target, implying almost 52% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba BABA launched an affordable logistics solution, namely Logistics Marketplace, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe new solution offers a point-of-contact for buyers and pre-vetted logistics service providers, enabling businesses to offer tailored solutions to their target customers. This service is meant for reshaping the supply chain strategies of various enterprises and reducing traditional logistics hurdles.\r\n\r\nThis solution allows buyers to compare real-time quotes from various logistics service providers, book tailored solutions, and view verified options like customs clearance, storage, combined shipments and drop shipping.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it includes \"Send Inquiry\" and \"Logistics RFQ\" features for sellers, streamlining their process of partnering with freight forwarders.\r\n\r\nHence, Alibaba is expected to gain solid traction across SMEs in the United States on the back of its latest move which will help these businesses to expand their global reach.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nStrengthening Logistics Services Aids Growth\n\nApart from the launch of Logistics Marketplace, Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm Cainiao announced the launch of a \"consolidated shipping\" service in the United States, bolstering its overseas logistics offerings.\r\n\r\nThe cross-border service packages multiple shopping orders from various Chinese e-commerce platforms and delivers them to U.S. customers via air and sea transport routes, reducing delivery times to as little as five days.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s launch of Cainiao Express, a new express delivery service, remains noteworthy. It aims to offer doorstep, half-day, same-day and next-day deliveries to select Alibaba-owned businesses.\r\n\r\nAlibaba Group also revealed its plans to invest $1.1 billion in South Korea over three years in its quest to build a logistics center and expand businesses across the country. The company further announced that it would invest $200 million this year for the development of the logistics center and $100 million for small and mid-sized firms.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors are expected to aid the company in capitalizing on the growth opportunities present in the global logistics market. Per an Allied Market Research report, the global logistics market is expected to reach $16.79 trillion by 2032, indicating a CAGR of 5.6% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects of Alibaba in the promising logistics market will likely strengthen the company\u2019s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA\u2019s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $130.77 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 3.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nHowever, Alibaba faces stiff competition from notable industry players like Amazon AMZN and JD.com JD in the logistics market space. Its shares have lost 11.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s return of 6.4%.\r\n\r\nAmazon introduced an end-to-end supply chain service called \"Supply Chain by Amazon,\" allowing third-party sellers to pick up inventory, ship across borders, handle customs clearance, store bulk inventory and deliver to customers.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the company launched Amazon Shipping, a ground shipping service for sellers, offering delivery on orders on Amazon.com, sellers' websites, and other channels, covering domestic shipments within the United States.\r\n\r\nJD.com, on the other hand, recently announced that its logistics arm, JD Logistics expanded its international express delivery service from Guangzhou and Shenzhen to nearly every district in China. The service offers efficient logistics solutions for various products, including documents and apparel, among others, with the United States, the U.K. and Germany as top destinations.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the company announced its partnership with Geopost to bolster its global logistics capabilities. The partnership will allow seamless C2C and B2C shipping services between China and Europe, providing comprehensive tracking, delivery and one-stop express solutions for individuals and businesses.\n\nZacks Rank & Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the same sector is The Gap GPS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "title": "3 Under-the-Radar Stocks Peter Lynch Would Love",
        "content": "One of the greatest investors of our time is Peter Lynch. He took Fidelity Magellan from $20 million in assets under management (AUM) in 1977 to $14 billion AUM in 1990 when he retired, a 29% annual average return over that period.\u00a0This has led us to create this list of under-the-radar stocks for investors.\n\nLynch also wrote two of the best value investing books that distilled his simple investment philosophy into an accessible medium. \u201cOne Up on Wall Street\u201d and \u201cBeating the Street\u201d are still important investment guides any investor can use today.\n\nIn short, Lynch didn\u2019t want to overpay for stocks, preferring to buy them at a discount. Yet he wanted businesses that exhibited financial discipline and saw profits grow over time. He also liked looking in out-of-the-way spots for his stock picks. Below are three Peter Lynch stocks that seem to tick all the boxes. Let\u2019s find out if they\u2019re right for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCactus (WHD)\n\nCactus (NYSE:WHD) is a small but growing player in the oilfield services industry dominated by the likes of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and SLB (NYSE:SLB). While it sells pressure control equipment for wellheads, recent periods have seen the oil and gas industry reduce the number of rig counts in operation despite soaring prices.\n\nThat\u2019s the new economics of the industry. Drillers like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are limiting capital expenditures to maintain profitability instead of going through a boom-and-bust cycle. Now they focus on their most profitable fields while seeking more measured expansion.\n\nIn the most recent survey, Baker Hughes reported 617 rigs in operation, three fewer than the week before and 131 less than last year. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude sells for $84 a barrel today, 6% above last year\u2019s price.\n\nTo compensate for these kinds of swings, Cactus acquired FlexSteel, a manufacturer of \u200b\u200bspoolable pipe technologies. It diversifies Cactus\u2019 operations while offering significant growth potential because of the complementary services it provides with Cactus\u2019s legacy product line and the inroads it has already made with industry majors.\n\nAt just 15 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates, a fraction of Wall Street\u2019s estimated earnings growth rates and just 11x the free cash flow Cactus produces, this is a stock that Lynch could love. If you are looking for under-the-radar stocks, start here.\n\nHudson Technologies (HDSN)\n\nI\u2019ve been watching Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) for some time now, and though early in my call on the inflection point for the stock (read, wrong), I still believe it is imminent.\n\nStory continues\n\nHudson is the biggest player in the green refrigerant market with a 35% share. In 2020, Congress enacted the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, a law that phases out virgin hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), so-called greenhouse gases that contribute to supposed global warming. By 2036, the federal EPA wants HFCs to be reduced by 85%. That forced reduction is going to lead to shortages of popular refrigerants like R-410A and R-134a could surface, affecting prices. The former is one of the most popular refrigerants in the country and is typically used in a home\u2019s central air conditioning system. The latter is used in most automobile AC systems.\n\nThat\u2019s where Hudson Technologies comes in. As the law cuts into available supplies, demand for reclaimed refrigerants will grow. Hudson saw business spike when the law was first enacted, but saw the fear gradually subsided when refrigerants didn\u2019t immediately evaporate. Because it is a phased-in law, the hysteria will mount once more as greater swaths of supply are removed from the market. Hudson stock should grow alongside the return of the industry\u2019s mounting concern.\n\nThe stock trades at eight times earnings estimates, at a fraction of earnings growth rates and just 8x FCF. Hudson isn\u2019t a household name yet but because of the government\u2019s actions, it likely will be soon. This is easily one of the top under-the-radar stocks.\n\nJD.com (JD)\n\nOkay, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) isn\u2019t the most obscure name in stocks but because it is an e-commerce platform in China it isn\u2019t front-of-mind with most people the way Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is. It also trades at massive discounts that are tough to ignore particularly with some large catalysts approaching.\n\nJD and sister online retailer Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) saw their shares crumble under relentless government attacks on technology stocks. The ongoing sluggishness of the Chinese economy also weighed heavily on their shares. Yet Beijing finally relented in its pursuit of corruption and is pushing for stimulus programs to bolster consumers. Bloomberg reports the government\u2019s budget plan for the coming year holds an even bigger stimulus package than many expect.\n\nThat could be perfect timing for JD.com\u2019s annual 618 annual shopping extravaganza. Named for the company\u2019s founding (June 18), last year it ran from the end of May to mid-June. Think of it as Amazon Prime Day on steroids. Analysts estimate JD sold around $60 billion worth of merchandise last year. It should launch again in the next month or so.\n\nJD.com stock goes for just seven times earnings estimates, a fraction of earnings growth estimates and an even smaller fraction of sales. This just might be the biggest no-brainer Peter Lynch stock on the list. Improve your portfolio with these under-the-radar stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in XOM and CVX stock.

        "content": "Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce firm\u00a0Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), isn\u2019t the company\u2019s decision maker anymore. Yet, Alibaba got a major shot in the arm when Ma released a memo to the company\u2019s employees. Not only that, but Ma has skin in the game, financially speaking, and you should too, if you see the value in Alibaba stock.\n\nAlibaba is making headway in China\u2019s market for generative artificial intelligence. Sure, there\u2019s room for Alibaba to grow and improve in that area. But then, the prospect of future growth is what makes BABA stock so compelling now.\n\nAlibaba Stock: A Cheap Gen-AI Play\n\nSome AI-related stocks are overpriced, but not Alibaba stock. Now, you might think Alibaba is only an e-commerce company, but Alibaba-backed Moonshot AI is gaining traction in China\u2019s gen-AI chatbot market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to AIcpb.com (per The South China Morning Post), Moonshot AI\u2019s Kimi gen-AI chatbot \u201csaw total traffic to its website and app reach 12.6 million views in March.\u201d That\u2019s \u201cmore than quadruple\u201d the figure from February.\n\nConsequently, Kimi became China\u2019s second-largest chatbot, replacing Alibaba\u2019s own AI chatbot, Tongyi Qianwen, in that spot. In first place, by the way, is Baidu\u2019s (NASDAQ:BIDU) Ernie Bot.\n\nEven though Alibaba is a serious playing in China\u2019s gen-AI chatbot war, the company\u2019s shares aren\u2019t overpriced at all. In fact, Alibaba\u2019s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 13.66x, versus the sector median P/E ratio of 17.29x.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Founder Is Also an Investor\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a good sign when a company\u2019s founder is also a shareholder. Ma reportedly purchased $50 million worth of Alibaba stock in the fourth quarter of 2023, so clearly, he still believes in the company.\n\nMa is Alibaba\u2019s largest single shareholder, and although he retired from the company in 2019, he\u2019s evidently excited about Alibaba\u2019s future prospects. Regarding Alibaba and AI, Ma remarked, \u201cThe AI era has just arrived. Everything has just begun, and we are in the moment!\u201d\n\nIn an internal note to Alibaba\u2019s employees, Ma expressed his optimism despite the company\u2019s challenges and growing pains. \u201cWe are starting to operate on the diseases of a big company,\u201d Ma observed.\n\nMa\u2019s commentary comes at a time when Alibaba is in a transitional period. From re-shuffling managers to considering the sale of non-core assets, Alibaba is undergoing what Ma calls a \u201cpath of reform and innovation.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Ma encouraged Alibaba to \u201c[a]dd oil\u201d as the gears of change do their strenuous work in 2024. In the end, Ma\u2019s confidence isn\u2019t everything to Alibaba, but it\u2019s certainly something.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba Stock: The Underpriced AI Investment You\u2019re Missing Out On\n\nAlibaba still has work to do if it wants to compete successfully in China\u2019s gen-AI chatbot market. However, Alibaba\u2019s low valuation suggests that the market doesn\u2019t fully appreciate the company\u2019s growth potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Ma is putting his money where his mouth is as he\u2019s a major Alibaba shareholder. So, if you\u2019re a value seeker who likes to find hidden treasures in the market, go ahead and pick up some Alibaba stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Top Dividend Stocks Set for 200%+ Gains by 2028",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are your best friend if you\u2019re looking to compound your money safely without worrying about the massive downside risk that often comes with buying into high-flying tech or growth stocks. However, not all dividend payers are boring old companies with no potential for capital appreciation. The current environment has caused many great businesses to trade far below their intrinsic value, and they also offer juicy dividends alongside their undervaluation. Buying them up now could see you realize triple-digit percentage gains if you hold them through the next four years or more, especially if you keep reinvesting those dividends.\n\nThese dividend stocks provide you with a margin of safety, income you can count on, and explosive upside potential once Mr. Market realizes how underpriced they are. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) Marijuana Cannabis Leaf Stock Market Symbol Company Business 3d Illustration. Cannabis stocks\n\nSource: iQoncept / Shutterstock.com\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) is a unique company that leases out space to cannabis growers. Earlier, it was seen as a riskier bet by some investors due to the financial struggles of cannabis companies. However, IIPR has proven the naysayers wrong, with over 90% of rents consistently paid on time by tenants. This is a testament to the rigorous vetting and careful selection of tenants by IIPR\u2019s management.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has recovered well from its 2021 plunge, up 34% in the past year. I believe the excessive fears around IIPR\u2019s business model have proven unwarranted. A key factor driving my bullishness is the company\u2019s exceptionally high dividend yield of 7.53%. This blows away almost all competing REITs\u2019 dividends. The company boasts an 83% FCF margin, allowing for significant growth in dividends. Over the past 3 years, IIPR has increased its dividend at a 17.3% annual rate, better than 84% of industry peers. Its 5-year yield-on-cost stands at a remarkable 41.5%, superior to almost 99% of REITs.\n\nWith a high-quality tenant base delivering reliable rental income, IIPR has the potential to continue increasing its dividend at an above-average pace. The stock offers a rare combination of substantial income today and exceptional income growth tomorrow. This is why I believe IIPR has the legs to deliver outsized 200%+ gains over the next four years. A potential catalyst is the federal legalization of cannabis, which could spur a major re-rating of IIPR\u2019s valuation multiples. Regardless, the company\u2019s impressive dividend growth merits a far higher valuation. For investors seeking oversized total returns with minimized risk, dividend stocks like IIPR are worth looking into.\n\nStory continues\n\nVolkswagen (VWAGY) A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.\n\nSource: multitel / Shutterstock.com\n\nVolkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) is another criminally undervalued company that I believe can stage a powerful recovery, potentially doubling or more by 2028. The stock has plunged 57% from its 2021 peak but has climbed 18% year-to-date in 2024. I expect this rebound to continue as auto sales volumes pick up globally.\n\nA major overhang on VWAGY is its massive debt load of $257 billion. However, the company can still generate profits thanks to its hefty margins and substantial $56.2 billion cash buffer. Once interest rates decline in Europe, Volkswagen\u2019s interest expenses should fall dramatically from the $3.6 billion paid in 2023. This influx of billions can re-ignite substantial growth.\n\nRate cuts are a question of when not if. Once they materialize, we could see a major re-rating of VWAGY as profits explode higher. Regardless, the current valuation is far too attractive to ignore. With a forward P/E of just 4.5x, shares are trading near trough levels and appear to be bottoming out.\n\nI believe accumulating VWAGY around current levels will pay off in a big way. This is an iconic auto brand with staying power, and the market is underestimating its ability to adapt and thrive in the years ahead. The hefty 6.2% dividend yield provides income while you wait for the market to realize how underpriced VWAGY is today. It is one of the best dividend stocks you can buy in the automotive sector.\n\nDollar General (DG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI have been pounding the table on Dollar General (NYSE:DG) ever since the stock plunged, and I\u2019m thrilled to see the story play out positively in 2024 so far. However, I believe the bulk of the gains are still ahead. DG continues trading at a substantial discount to its intrinsic value, in my view. We\u2019ve seen such low valuations about five years back, and snapping up shares for a multi-year position will likely turn out to be a very lucrative decision.\n\nBig-name retail brands with enduring appeal rarely disappoint when bought near historically low valuations. I believe acquiring DG below $150 per share is an incredible bargain that will pay off handsomely over time. Reaching $400-450 or more by 2028 is not unrealistic, in my view.\n\nAt today\u2019s prices, Dollar General is priced based on historical CPI growth rates, yet with margins below its long-term average. Its terminal growth is also below historical same-store sales growth. It\u2019s hard to ignore a stock trading at such a discount to its earnings power.\n\nFor investors seeking a \u201csurefire\u201d triple-digit return over the next four years, DG checks all the boxes in my view. The dividend isn\u2019t as high or reliable as some stocks, but capital appreciation potential more than makes up for it. I remain exceedingly bullish on dividend stocks like DG and believe long-term investors will be rewarded handsomely.\n\n&M European Value Retail (BMRRY) Retail workers checking produce at a grocery store.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nB&M European Value Retail (OTCMKTS:BMRRY) operates general merchandise and grocery stores under the B&M, Heron Foods, and B&M Express brands in the U.K., as well as B&M stores in France. The company has certainly been on a rollercoaster ride over the past four years. However, for investors with a long-term horizon, I believe BMRRY offers enticing upside potential.\n\nThe discount retail industry is poised for rapid growth amidst the challenging macroeconomic climate. BMRRY itself has demonstrated impressive growth, with revenue expanding at a 10.9% CAGR over the past 5 years. EBITDA growth has been even more remarkable, at a 15.5% CAGR over this period. Analysts expect high single-digit top-line growth to continue through 2028.\n\nEqually impressive is BMRRY\u2019s industry-leading profitability. Its 7% net profit margin handily beats 87% of retail peers. The company\u2019s 3-year dividend growth rate of nearly 30% also crushes 91% of competitors. It\u2019s one of those dividend stocks to consider.\n\nShares may not appear screamingly cheap today, but I see a 40-70% upside over the next four years as earnings expand. With strong execution, 200% gains are not out of the question in my view.\n\nJD.Com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) is just like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and like BABA, JD stock has been lackluster at best lately. However, the brutal decline has slowed, and shares have traded sideways for months now. Signs are emerging that China is softening its regulatory crackdown and loosening monetary policy. This could provide a catalyst for JD to deliver multibagger returns on its way up as the Chinese economy recovers.\n\nChina\u2019s e-commerce market remains massive with an expected 10% CAGR from 2024-2029. Gurufocus sees JD\u2019s fair value at $67 by the end of 2026, which seems reasonable to me if China continues opening up its economy. While JD may fall short of such explosive gains, I don\u2019t anticipate much further downside from current levels either. The stock already trades at basement valuations, providing a margin of safety.\n\nInvestors can collect a 3% dividend yield while awaiting China\u2019s reopening and any upside that brings for JD. With patience, I believe current prices will prove to be an excellent long-term entry point. This makes it one of those dividend stocks to buy.\n\nGlobe Life (GL) Stock market data on digital LED display. A daily market price and quotation of prices chart and candle stick tracking for Forex trading. Financial data on the digital screen as concept. Dividend stocks\n\nSource: Things / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobe Life (NYSE:GL) is a leading financial services and insurance company operating through wholly-owned subsidiaries. It offers life insurance, annuities, and supplemental health products. The insurance sector tends to be recession-proof and safe for long-term investors. GL proved a steady winner for years until plunging from $128 to $56 in under two months.\n\nThe drastic selloff stemmed from federal probes and short seller reports alleging mostly cultural issues. While troubling, the allegations were almost entirely non-financial. With the drama now exposed, I expect GL to address any legitimate cultural concerns. Either way, the stock looks like a bargain trading at 5.5x earnings with no imminent financial threats that I can see.\n\nGL has a solid history of buybacks and a 1.6% dividend yield. For investors with a multi-year horizon, I believe accumulating shares around current levels will pay off nicely as the business fundamentals reassert themselves.\n\nAmpol (CTXAY) Wealth And Financial Freedom Creation Through Dividend Reinvestment (DRIP) Plan With Well Known Safe Low Expense Ratio Index Funds. Dividend stocks\n\nSource: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmpol (OTCMKTS:CTXAY) is an Australian company operating in the refining, marketing, and distribution of petroleum products. The company has performed remarkably well over the past 18 months, and I expect this momentum to continue amid geopolitical tensions that are buoying oil prices.\n\nBeyond an attractive macro backdrop, CTXAY offers investors a juicy 7.1% dividend yield. Its 1.5% net margin also has substantial room for expansion, lagging 60% of oil and gas peers. If Ampol can improve operational efficiency and margins, shares could surge over the next several years.\n\nCTXAY appears significantly undervalued, trading at just 11.6x forward earnings. Gurufocus estimates its fair value at $100 currently and $195 by the end of 2026. For investors seeking big dividend income plus triple-digit upside, I believe CTXAY checks all the boxes. Oil stocks can be volatile, but the risk-reward here seems skewed decidedly in investors\u2019 favor over a multi-year investment horizon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Hidden treasures sometimes go overlooked in the busy world of financial markets. Here, attention is frequently drawn to the names with the most sparkle. The purpose of this piece is to highlight three of these less shiny treasures.\n\nThe first one sticks out for its unwavering dedication to pharmaceutical innovation. The company may grow long term with a strong pipeline driven by cutting-edge technologies like AI and a record year of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals in 2023.\n\nThe second, a giant of the e-commerce industry, is not just securing a place for itself in the cloud services industry but also paving the way for profitable growth. Furthermore, the company\u2019s platform-based foray into global e-commerce represents a promising diversification strategy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLastly, despite being frequently eclipsed by social media behemoths, the third one shows tenacity and profitability. Thanks to its consistent advertising income and user base increase, it remains a strong competitor in the interactive media space.\n\nTaken as a whole, these businesses represent triple-digit potential stocks that have been missed. Their adaptability, creativity and strategic vision present a chance to seize unrealized development in a competitive market environment.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nA record year for FDA approvals in 2023 signifies Pfizer\u2019s (NYSE:PFE) strong pipeline execution skills. This included nine approvals for novel molecular entities and many indications for already-approved drugs. By constantly introducing new drugs to the market and expanding treatment choices across therapeutic categories, this pipeline innovation prepares Pfizer for sustainable growth.\n\nMoreover, Pfizer has demonstrated its focus on hitting unmet medical demand and broadening its product portfolio by investing in research across therapeutic areas outside of cancer. These include vaccinations, internal medicine, metabolic illnesses, immunology and anti-infectives.\n\nFurther, Pfizer\u2019s\u00a0acquisition of Seagen greatly expands its cancer research capabilities and portfolio development potential. This supports the company\u2019s strategy to become a world-class leader in oncology. Pfizer may lead the worldwide cancer treatment market due to its portfolio and resource alignment with the high-growth oncology sector and the forecast of at least eight blockbuster drugs by 2030.\n\nFinally, Pfizer takes advantage of market possibilities by pushing important cancer catalysts, such as commercial launches and Phase 3 data readouts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba (BABA) A photo of the Alibaba (BABA) app on a smartphone.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) Cloud is prioritizing public cloud services. This strategic focus aligns with the boosted demand for cloud computing services, especially those provided by public clouds. Alibaba Cloud\u2019s adjusted EBITDA boosted by 86% year-over-year (YoY), even though its sales increased by only 3% YoY. This increase in profitability results from the cloud business\u2019s efficient cost control, optimized product mix and operational edge.\n\nWith a\u00a056% YoY rise in sales, Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) saw solid top-line growth, especially in its International Commerce Retail Business. Indeed, the expansion above highlights Alibaba\u2019s edge in growing its international e-commerce enterprise. This is propelled by platforms such as Trendyol and AliExpress. Moreover, Alibaba boosted its investment in AIDC throughout the quarter to maintain momentum and provide clients with services that set them apart, even in the face of losses in adjusted EBITA.\n\nFinally,\u00a0Cainiao\u2019s 24% YoY revenue growth was primarily attributable to higher sales of cross-border fulfillment services. This rise reflects the development of Alibaba\u2019s logistics network and its capacity to meet the rising demand for international e-commerce. As a result, Cainiao\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increased dramatically, turning a profit this year from the prior year\u2019s deficit.\n\nWeibo (WB) social media stocks weibo.com sign on window\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeibo\u2019s (NASDAQ:WB) advertising revenues were comparable to the pattern of its total revenues. With overall ad sales of $403.7 million in Q4 2023, there was 3% YoY and 4% sequential growth. This suggests that the advertising market is expanding favorably, boosting overall income.\n\nAdditionally, with a non-GAAP\u00a0operating margin of 31%, Weibo\u2019s operating income for Q4 was $145.9 million. Weibo can sustain a robust operating margin based on sharp cost management and operational efficacy. The non-GAAP operating income for 2023 was $592.1 million. This translates to a solid non-GAAP operating margin of 34%. Hence, this demonstrates high profitability, suggesting that Weibo can stay profitable despite difficulties with the top-line.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, Weibo\u2019s monthly active users (MAUs) increased to\u00a0598 million, an 11 million increase from 2022. Furthermore, the average number of daily active users (DAUs) increased by 5 million from 2022 to 257 million. To sum up, Weibo\u2019s growth potency may be attributed to the increasing MAUs and DAUs, indicating that the platform is still relevant and enticing to users.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PFE and BABA.

This discrepancy exists because inflation indexes measure ongoing growth, not actual price differences, leading to persistently low consumer confidence despite apparently positive inflation statistics.\n\nAt the same time, high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are becoming prohibitively expensive for retail traders, particularly as market volatility and general frothiness surge. This is where stocks priced under $50 come into play. They\u2019re generally cheap enough that a decent-sized share count is easy to accumulate. At the same time, each one is positioned for rapid growth due to specific favorable conditions and bullish momentum, paving the way for potential success.

With a solid foundation of government contracts and an expanding corporate portfolio, the artificial intelligence and machine learning company finally escaped its mid-teens rangebound trading after a strong earnings report propelled shares up by 30% since January.\n\nThat report also marked its fifth consecutive profitable quarter, recording earnings of 8 cents per share and a 14% revenue increase from government contracts at year\u2019s end. More notably, revenue from its commercial segment jumped by 36%. While past bearish sentiment often focused on its reliance on government contracts, Palantir\u2019s successful expansion into the corporate sector now distinguishes it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the per-share price is well under $50, the stock has remained stubbornly within the $20 \u2013 $25 range, possibly as part of CEO Alex Karp\u2019s beef with short sellers.

Unlike Alibaba, GigaCloud is not just about product sourcing; it offers a comprehensive vendor management platform designed to handle cross-border payments and other complex aspects of global eCommerce that often challenge small businesses.\n\nThe small business market remains largely untapped, and GigaCloud\u2019s solutions, including payment processing, shipment and freight management, AI-enabled fulfillment, and warehouse storage, provide a unique value proposition. This integrated service package is particularly valuable for entrepreneurs who struggle to compete with larger entities like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As companies like Amazon continue to increase fees and fulfillment rates, SMBs looking to maintain independence will increasingly turn to self-sourced/self-managed platforms like GigaCloud.\n\nNews Corp (NWSA) News Corp. (NWSA_ Building front\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNews Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) may initially seem out of place among other under-$50 stocks due to its roots in legacy media\u2014an industry not typically associated with high-flying prospects. Historically dependent on newspapers, books, and cable television, News Corp is distinguishing itself through a successful pivot to next-generation media formats.\n\nThis shift in News Corp\u2019s strategy is partly driven by Starboard Value, an activist investor firm that recently snagged a significant stake in the company. Following this investment, News Corp reported a 3% increase in quarterly revenue year-over-year and a 94% boost in net income. CEO Robert Thomson attributes these financial gains to the company\u2019s strategic emphasis on digital and subscription revenues, moving away from the less predictable advertising revenue model.\n\nThis strategy mirrors that of many software-based under-$50 stocks, which favor recurring revenue streams over sporadic, larger payments. For instance, News Corp is focusing on acquiring digital subscriptions rather than chasing high-budget advertising accounts, similar to how Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) now offers Photoshop on a subscription basis rather than as a costly one-time purchase.\n\nThis strategic pivot is bearing fruit, especially in niche areas like the Dow Jones segment and digital real estate services, both of which are performing strongly. Although News Corp currently places less emphasis on dividends to focus on adapting its operations for the digital era, it still offers a modest 1.65% total yield, striking a balance between operational changes and shareholder returns.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: Steelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSteelcase (NYSE:SCS), a high-end office furniture company, emerges as a standout under-$50 value stock that retail traders tend to skip over. The company is thriving post-pandemic as it adapts to the evolving work-from-home trends, underscored by its recent declaration of a $0.10 quarterly dividend, representing a 61% payout ratio and a 2.88% yield.\n\nSteelcase has rapidly regained its financial stability after a challenging pandemic period. Its latest quarterly report revealed a net income of $30.8 million, more than doubled from last year\u2019s figure. Furthermore, sales have maintained a steady pace of around $800 million over the past five quarters, showing that Steelcase is improving margins without sacrificing quality.\n\nIn reaction to the shifting work-from-home landscape, Steelcase is repositioning to target 5-7% annual sales growth and a 5% free cash flow margin (as a percentage of revenue) over the next five years. At the same time, the company has significantly cut its debt to better cope with the higher-rate environment, enhancing liquidity and reducing interest costs. These strategic initiatives mark Steelcase as one of the most promising stocks under-$50 stocks to buy now.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough Snap (NYSE:SNAP) contends with competitive pressures as younger users flock to newer apps, the under-$50 stock is far from defeated. Instead, it\u2019s buoyed by its virtual and augmented reality strides and a growing advertising platform.\n\nSnap aims to surpass 475 million daily active users in 2024, setting a target above Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The app\u2019s appeal is further enhanced by its vast array of augmented reality lenses, created by over 350,000 AR developers and totaling nearly 3.5 million lenses.\n\nFinancially, Snap\u2019s short-term prospects look promising, with advertising revenue expected to grow by more than 20% in 2024, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s forecast of 14% and aligning with Snap\u2019s ambitious goals. For the upcoming quarter, Snap anticipates revenue between $1,095 million and $1,135 million, marking a year-over-year increase of 11% to 15%. These positive indicators position Snap as a compelling choice among under-$50 stocks, especially for those bullish on long-term augmented reality trends.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: Braze, Inc. (BRZE) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nAdvertising technology is undergoing a quiet renaissance as digital consumer trends evolve and media becomes more centered around content creators. Venture capital is pouring into private AdTech firms, yet publicly traded Braze, Inc. (NASDAQ:BRZE) stands out as an under-$50 stock ideally positioned to capitalize on these emerging marketing trends. Braze enables brands to manage multichannel marketing across all major digital platforms, adopting a fresh and unique approach.\n\nUnlike traditional AdTech companies that target consumer segments through aggressive campaigns, Braze excels in navigating consumer engagement practices. It manages curated journeys that follow users across platforms and deliver a personalized and unique experience. This personalization fosters a mental connection between the user and the brand, effectively converting potential customers. This effective strategy is why well-known entities like Match (NASDAQ:MTCH), NASCAR, and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) flock to Braze\u2019s distinctive services.\n\nAlthough Braze is not yet profitable and trades at a premium today, despite its under-$50 pricing, the company is a pioneer in emerging advertising trends. Early entrants in such dynamic sectors often require time to build momentum and achieve profitability, so get in on the ground floor before it\u2019s too late.\n\nChegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs startups and established companies increasingly harness GPT-derived \u201cinnovations,\u201d Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) emerges as a robust EdTech contender, using artificial intelligence to transform traditional learning institutions and concepts. Although its shares currently trade nearly one-third lower than their January pricing, Chegg\u2019s solid fourth-quarter report has led to a new wave of analyst upgrades in anticipation of the first-quarter report due on April 29th.\n\nThe company already boasts a solid gross margin of 68%, with management predicting even higher margins for 2024 despite a slight dip in revenue and subscription rates in 2023. These forecasts come as the company invests heavily in R&D and related costs to develop new AI offerings and tailor them to evolving trends and technologies.\n\nCEO Dan Rosensweig has acknowledged the challenging balancing act, stating that the team \u201ccompletely reinvented the company by leveraging the advancements in artificial intelligence\u201d and that, as the initial AI hype wanes, \u201cleaders in their verticals like Chegg are taking control of their own destiny by building their own models [that offer] higher quality and lower cost.\u201d Chegg is finding its footing within the AI-enabled EdTech landscape. As more individuals and institutions adopt forward-looking technologies, this under-$50 stock is poised to potentially surge significantly in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Consumer stocks to buy now aren\u2019t just a fleeting trend. As the second quarter (Q2) rolls in, consumer stocks present themselves as excellent bets, offering the dual benefit of steady portfolio growth and attractive shareholder rewards.\n\nMoreover, we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters how the U.S. continues to exhibit robust signs of growth, outperforming analyst estimates. The robust consumer spending environment leads to higher profits and a more stable economic landscape. Despite the possibility of prolonged inflationary pressures, the resilience of the U.S. economy shines through. Its enduring strength underscores why consumer stocks remain compelling for those seeking security and growth amidst the market uncertainty. That said, here are three consumer stocks to buy now that embody the earlier discussion.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is one of the leading cosmetics businesses, thriving on the back of its unique blend of clean and vegan products with a remarkably affordable price point. It effectively caters to Gen Z\u2019s preferences, with its brand having established a dominant online and social media footprint. Its innovative approach has positioned it as one of the top growth stocks in its niche, with its stock gaining an eye-watering 475% in the past three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLooking ahead, its financial outlook remains exceptionally bright. It kicked into gear during the pandemic, delivering double-digit top-line growth, and has continued the momentum since then. Not only has it delivered double-digit sales growth in the past consecutive quarters, but it has also outperformed analyst estimates across both lines.\n\nIn the third quarter, its net sales surged 85% year-over-year (YOY) to $270.9 million while besting analyst estimates of $32 million. This momentum is projected to continue, with the company expecting net sales for the year to fall in the $980 million and $990 million range, marking an impressive increase of 69% to 71% compared to the prior year. Moreover, according to TipRanks analysts, ELF stock is a \u2018moderate buy\u2019\u00a0offering a healthy 28% upside from current price levels.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce giant that\u2019s flown under the radar in the past few years. Like its peers, the company has weathered its fair share of headwinds alongside the struggling Chinese economy. Current market conditions are far from conducive, but the company remains agile and has multiple long-term growth catalysts, which makes it an attractive bet. Additionally, BABA stock trades at just a forward 1.30 times trailing-twelve-month-sales (TTM), 69% lower than the sector median.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt boasts a massive cash reserve exceeding $91.6 billion, which positions it incredibly well to navigate economic turbulence. Its financial robustness allows the tech giant to push forward with aplomb and undertake potentially risky ventures without the pressure of external financing.\n\nFurthermore, the company continues to refine its core operations and revenue strategies through Taobao and Tmall while actively expanding into burgeoning markets and new business areas. Moreover, new segments, such as the Digital Commerce group and the Cainiao logistics arm, delivered 44% and 27% YOY growth, respectively, in its most recent quarter. Its move into digital commerce and logistics is particularly strategic, as it efficiently taps into the rapid e-commerce adoption across high-growth regions, including Southeast Asia and Latin America.\n\nIngredion (INGR) Ingredion Canada Inc head office in Brampton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIngredion (NYSE:INGR) manufactures diverse ingredient solutions catering to various sectors, from food to textiles. Over the years, it has operated a business that\u2019s exhibited consistent growth across both lines. This growth has been mirrored by its stock, which has gained over 21% in the past three years. However, its excellent dividend profile helps INGR\u2019s stock stand out. It yields a tremendous 2.83% while growing its payouts in the past 13 years, beating the sector median of two years.\n\nWhile top-line growth in recent quarters has been uninspiring due to multiple headwinds, the company has efficiently maintained its solid profitability profile. For instance,\u00a0its free cash flow margin of 6.40% beats the sector median by 30%, while its return on common equity is an eye-catching 20%.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s role in multiple growing market segments, I expect INGR stock to bounce back in a more conducive business environment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Got $1,000? These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Still a Bargain",
        "content": "Investors have moved heavily into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the last 18 months. The release of a vastly improved version of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 forced the shareholding public to rethink the power of AI, and some stocks experienced massive increases.\n\nHowever, the market did not treat all AI stocks equally, and some struggled because of the perception that they had or were going to fall behind. Some of these market perceptions were probably overly negative, creating an opportunity in three AI stocks, even for those with only a $1,000 investment budget. Let's take a look at why these three AI stocks are now a bargain.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), has long been synonymous with AI. Since it first began using machine learning to correct spelling in 2001, it has been a leader in the AI field. It also became an \"AI-first\" company in 2016, meaning that it integrated AI into all products from that point forward.\n\nStill, the release of an improved version of ChatGPT changed perceptions. Google Search competitor Microsoft's Bing began integrating ChatGPT into its search tool in 2023, leading investors to question whether Alphabet could maintain its lead in search. Additionally, the release of its competing product, Google Gemini, received mixed reviews.\n\nNonetheless, the company recently combined its AI research arms with Google DeepMind to consolidate its efforts. Moreover, it holds around $111 billion in liquidity. Hence, if it cannot innovate in the field, it can probably buy out a company that can. These resources should help the company stay competitive in the AI field.\n\nFurthermore, despite its \"struggles,\" its stock is up by almost 50% over the last year to just under $160 per share as of the time of this writing. Also, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27, it sells at a lower valuation than all of the \"Fab 4\" stocks (see chart below). With its valuation and tremendous optionality, the negative perceptions are likely a buying opportunity, not a harbinger of long-term decline for the company. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\n2. Apple\n\nAlthough investors may not think about it, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is an AI company. It invests heavily in AI-related research, and product features such as the iPhone's Siri, FaceID, and its keyboard are a few examples of AI-driven functionality.\n\nHowever, Apple has not released a \"major\" new product in several years, and its fastest-growing segment in terms of revenue is Apple Services. That strategy may have led to the perception that Apple is becoming less competitive on the technology front.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Benzinga, Apple plans to release some generative AI tools in June. Additionally, even when accounting for unrealized gains and losses, it held around $173 billion in liquidity as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 30). With such resources, it can likely find a way to compete in AI.\n\nAmid the pessimism, Apple stock lost value during 2024 and largely missed out on the AI-driven rally in 2023. But during that time, its P/E ratio fell to 28, making it cheaper than all of the Fab 4 stocks. If investors buy at today's price, around $175 per share at the time of this writing, they could earn significant returns as they see a clearer and more actionable generative AI strategy.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nIt is difficult to undercut Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) when it comes to cheap AI stocks. Alibaba's valuation has fallen to just 13 times earnings. It resembles Amazon by being the largest e-commerce company in China and also operating a cloud-infrastructure platform.\n\nHowever, it has become cheap for several reasons. Alibaba stock is an American depositary receipt (ADR), meaning Alibaba shareholders own shares in a proxy rather than the actual company. While that is a frequently used arrangement for international stocks, it becomes risky when relations with the company's government deteriorate.\n\nUnfortunately for American investors, tenuous U.S.-China relations led directly to a delisting threat in 2022 when the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) could not access the company's internal audits. While the U.S. and China resolved this issue, it reminded people of the risks of this stock.\n\nAdditionally, the issues have led to declines in the stock so severe that Alibaba stock is down from its initial public offering (IPO) 10 years ago and is going for around $70 per share at the time of this writing. BABA Chart\n\nStill, while Alibaba is risky, the stock price may mean that investors have gone too far in pricing in the risk.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Alibaba (BABA) reached $70.62, with a -0.94% movement compared to the previous day. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 1.2% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.65%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.79%.\n\nShares of the online retailer have depreciated by 2.9% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.91% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.85%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Alibaba will be of great interest to investors. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.56, showcasing no movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $30.96 billion, reflecting a 2.12% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alibaba. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Alibaba is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Alibaba is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.07. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 20.18.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 42, placing it within the top 17% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Stable Stocks for 50% Returns by Early 2025",
        "content": "Investors who seek 50% returns in less than 12 months generally will have many choices within stable stocks. The general maxim regarding risk and return applies here: Risky, unstable stocks tend to offer much higher return potential. It logically follows that stability and high returns don\u2019t\u00a0 often go together. This has led to this list of stable stocks for returns.\n\nThat\u2019s the point of this article. I\u2019ve used a screener tool to identify stocks that have a low beta and are also projected to increase by 50% or more in price.\n\nThe stocks discussed below generally represent more conservative and stable Industries. However, for various reasons, they are also primed to grow rapidly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at these stable stocks for returns which offer a potent combination of relative stability and high upside. They would make a nice addition to most portfolios.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) logistics stocks. supply chain stocks\n\nSource: Travel mania / Shutterstock.com\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a supply chain stock worth paying attention to. The company operates a less than truckload (LTL) freight shipping business.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line\u2019s most recent earnings report denotes softness within its sector. In all of 2023 revenues fell by 6.3% while net income fell by 10%. That said, the company began to head in the right direction toward the end of 2023. In the 4th quarter revenues increased very slightly despite a 2% decline in volumes. Thus, like many other firms, Old Dominion Freight Line is capable of passing on the higher prices to customers. It\u2019s one of those stable stocks for returns.\n\nThe company will need to do more given that net income declined by 0.3% in Q4. This screener suggests potential upside well above 50%. Old Dominion Freight Line\u2019s stability is evidenced by a beta of 1.03. The company has fourth quarter momentum on its side and a clear opportunity to continue appreciating in price.\n\nInsulet (PODD) Healthcare business graph data and growth, Medical examination and doctor analyzing medical report network connection on tablet screen. VANI stock\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock.com\n\nInsulet (NASDAQ:PODD) is one of many promising stocks within the burgeoning diabetes management industry. The company develops and sells automated insulin pod delivery systems that are paired with an automated glucose monitor. The market within which insulate operates is expected to essentially double in size between 2023 and 2030. Insulate will not be the only stock worth considering in this sector but it is one which offers relative stability paired with upside.\n\nLet\u2019s quickly look at those metrics that suggest its shares offer that combination. Share prices move essentially in line with the broader stock market based on its beta. Analyst target prices suggest that shares currently valued at $164 could increase by more than $100 in value.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find much fault in Insulet as an investment based on 2023 results. Revenues increased by 30% overall in 2023. Those results were even better in the fourth quarter with revenues increasing by nearly 38%.Perhaps even more importantly, Insulet became substantially more profitable last year. In 2022 the company reported $4.6 million in that income. That figure increased to $206.4 million in 2023.\n\nVinFast Auto (VFS) EvCard charging station. EvCard is China's first electric vehicle rental service. As of July 2017, it had around 6,000 cars and 3,000 stations in Shanghai. Chinese EV stocks\n\nSource: abolukbas / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is one of the better positioned companies and stocks on this list. The Vietnamese EV manufacturer represents multiple burgeoning sectors and is well regarded despite current issues affecting the electric vehicle industry overall.\n\nVietnam continues to emerge as a country for global supply chains as the China-U.S. rivalry heats up. The country has become a major export manufacturer and received fast growing foreign direct investment in recent years. It\u2019s part of the reason that VinFast Auto looks better than many of its contemporaries.\n\nIt\u2019s widely expected that the company\u2019s growth will see it through the current downturn that has plagued the EV sector.The company delivered nearly 35,000 vehicles in all of 2023, representing 374% growth. The company also gave guidance that it anticipates that it will deliver more than 100,000 vehicles in 2024. As the EV sector rebounds and those sales continue to increase shares have the potential to more than double and perhaps triple.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce giant and a stock that many have identified as one having high potential. It\u2019s well established that Alibaba often draws comparisons to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and I think that\u2019s a good place to start.\n\nAmazon is one of the most valuable firms globally with a market cap of roughly $1.8 trillion. Alibaba, on the other hand, carries a market cap of $188 billion. Amazon is expected to produce somewhere in the neighborhood of $640 billion in revenues in 2024. Alibaba is expected to produce approximately $140 billion. Amazon is roughly 10 times as valuable as Alibaba yet only produces approximately 4 to 5 times more sales. Does Amazon deserve a premium for having carved out such a strong business? Yes. Yet it\u2019s also easy to argue that Alibaba deserves more credit.\n\nThe company is also ramping up share buybacks with the intention of increasing share prices.\n\nChinese stocks have been troubled for the past few years but sooner or later Alibaba is going to rebound and produce strong returns.\n\nEnbridge (ENB) Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnbridge (NYSE:ENB) Is a pipeline transporter of oil and gas. In other words, it is a midstream energy stock and one worth considering for its stability and upside. The company operates the world\u2019s longest pipeline system with 9,299 miles of pipeline in the U.S. and 8,510 miles of pipeline in Canada.In bridges natural gas pipeline is much more extensive by mileage and moves roughly 20% of all gas consumed in the U.S.\n\nThe company\u2019s stability is evidenced by its most recent earnings report which reaffirmed its 2024 financial guidance. The company is particularly attractive given its position in relation to natural gas. Demand for LNG is high at present. Enbridge recently formed a joint venture in order to supply that high export demand. The JV will connect natural gas resources in the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. The stock also offers a high-yield dividend making it doubly attractive to income investors.\n\nIndie Semiconductor (INDI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIndie Semiconductor (NASDAQ:INDI) Is a chip company focused on the opportunity in the automotive sector. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and vehicle autonomy are a burgeoning market. It is expected that the ADAS market will grow at an annual rate of roughly 12% between this year and 2030.\n\nThe company, however, is growing at a much faster rate. Fourth quarter revenues eclipsed $70 million representing growth of 112% year over year. 2023 revenues increased by 101% reaching $223 million.\n\nThe company managed to win business by capturing in cabin monitoring program accounts with multiple large vehicle manufacturers. Meanwhile, Indie Semiconductor was also recognized by Morgan Stanley as the fastest growing Semiconductor company in the world over the past two years.\n\nThe company\u2019s net loss is also decreasing and reached $20 million in the fourth quarter. The company expects first quarter revenues to grow by nearly 40% making it a hypergrowth firm.\n\nTreace Medical Systems (TMCI) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nTreace Medical Systems (NYSE:TMCI) is a fast growing medical supply company in a niche area. The stock is expected to grow rapidly from its current price and position.\n\nThe company develops and sells systems that are used in the correction of foot issues. The medical terms for those procedures are called lapiplasty and adductoplasty. The terms refer to bunion correction and the correction of metatarsal bones, respectively.\n\nThe company just celebrated a milestone. Its Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System was used on the 100,000th patient. The company increased the number of train doctors for those systems by 20% during 2023. Average revenues For each correction kit sold reached $6,437, a record high. Revenues increased by 32% overall in 2023 and by 25% during the fourth quarter. The company has a clear opportunity to continue selling more of its procedure kits into healthcare systems and training doctors. It\u2019s clear that the returns on increased sales are very high given that a 20% increase in 2023 equated to a 32% increase in revenues.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Alibaba (BABA): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alibaba (BABA).\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy, representing 81.3% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alibaba, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in BABA?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.86.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alibaba.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Back in the last decade, I told anyone who would listen about the great news of Alibaba stock (NASDAQ:BABA). I even bought some shares.\n\nAlibaba was one of China\u2019s three \u201cCloud Emperors.\u201d Its hyperscaled data centers, like those of Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), were serious threats to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) in the cloud.\n\nNow Alibaba stock is down 60% from 5 years ago and I wouldn\u2019t touch it with a barge pole. It\u2019s a story America and its tech investors should be very glad for.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\nChinese dictator Xi Jinping decided that technology was a threat to his regime. He cracked down on the industry in favor of car companies like Nio (NYSE:NIO). A manufacturing workforce is a compliant one. Tech workers ask questions.\n\nSome of Xi\u2019s actions might be applauded by American liberals. Higher taxes, an end to monopoly, and taking responsibility for what\u2019s online are common political demands here. But Xi went further, demanding that technology serve him, not the market and not the people.\n\nThe result was predictable. I would have predicted it if I thought Xi really would kill his economy to retain absolute power. I was wrong. In this case, American conservatives were right.\n\nThe three years since the crackdown haven\u2019t just cost China $1.1 trillion in market cap. They\u2019ve let America lap China\u2019s whole economy. China has missed the AI boom because, like all tech innovations, AI rides on the minds of empowered talent. Freedom is the price of competing in technology. If you want people to think differently you first must allow them to think freely.\n\nMa Comes Back\n\nIn the crackdown, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma was Xi\u2019s bete noir. Once China\u2019s wealthiest man, Ma was driven from the country, eventually taking a position with Tokyo University.\n\nMa still visits China. He\u2019s still a name. The stock jumped just this week after he praised the company\u2019s reorganization. To hide itself from Xi\u2019s wrath, Alibaba is splitting itself into six pieces. But even Alibaba insiders weren\u2019t fooled. CEO Daniel Zhang quit.\n\nMa\u2019s remarks praising management gave Alibaba stock a brief boost. But the stock is flat for 2024, down 26% over the last year. The company is not what it was. Even in e-commerce, Alibaba is being lapped by Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD), whose Temu site offers cheap, customized goods from a network of online sweatshops.\n\nAlibaba is distracted by the government and its internal turmoil. It is missing the entrepreneurship that once made it great. Sales for 2023 were down from 2022. Profit growth has stalled, and the company has missed several profit estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nMa wants Alibaba to \u201cgrasp the opportunity of AI,\u201d focusing their efforts on customers. Mistakes were made, he says, but Alibaba is now more \u201csimple and agile.\u201d\n\nFine words, but China\u2019s smartest people aren\u2019t fooled. They\u2019re voting against Xi with their feet, taking their talent and money with them.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe gating factor to growth in our time isn\u2019t resources like oil, or simple manufacturing prowess, as it was a century ago.\n\nIt\u2019s people. Trained, empowered, and free minds are the gating factor to growth today. The more talent you can attract, and the more security you can give them, in their work and in their life, the more money you can make.\n\nAlibaba stock can\u2019t deliver that because Xi Jinping won\u2019t let it. American policymakers are fighting a tariff war, seeking to limit China\u2019s access to AI chips. But that isn\u2019t why we\u2019re winning this Cold War.\n\nFreedom is what\u2019s winning this Cold War. Xi won\u2019t allow it, Ma can\u2019t grant it, and Alibaba is stuck as a result.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held LONG positions in AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "title": "10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most undervalued value stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and undervalued stocks, then you can check out 5 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAmong the several categories that stocks can be divided into, two categories are value stocks and growth stocks. They stand on the opposite end of the spectrum and cater to investors with different kinds of risk appetite and goals. These stocks are defined primarily through the price to earnings ratio, which measures the premium that the stock market is paying over the firm's ability to make a profit. The higher the ratio is, the more a stock can be said to be a 'growth' stock and vice versa, with the industry in which the value stock or growth stock belongs also playing a crucial role as different sectors often have wildly varying P/E ratios.\n\nInvestors who pile into growth stocks do so to grow their money. A stock with a high P/E ratio shows that the market believes that it will grow its earnings significantly in the future and is therefore willing to bet on this future growth in the present. On the flip side, value stocks are for those investors who just want to place their money in a stable security and just forget about it. As opposed to growth stocks, whose high P/E ratio comes with the risk of significant share price drop in case of an untoward event, value stocks are relatively insulated since investors have not paid a hefty premium over their earnings. One exception to this statement is value traps which are stocks with strong current earnings but negative earnings growth rates. Value traps may look cheap but investors face significant capital destruction risk.\n\nThis fundamental difference between value stocks and growth stocks is most often based on their business models. So say, one example of a value stock, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), is unlikely to be perceived by investors to leave a blazing trail in its wake of pursuing high technology innovation. On the flip side, investors of the eCommerce behemoth Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), rightly have high expectations from the firm when it comes to maintaining a foothold (or stronghold) in the high growth eCommerce market and artificial intelligence. This is also reflected in Amazon's forward and trailing P/E ratios which currently sit at 43.67 and 63.82, respectively. For more on growth stocks, you can check out 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother set of categories that stocks can be divided into are undervalued and overvalued stocks. In fact, stock valuation sits at the heart of an investing philosophy called Value Investing. This set of beliefs has found some highly successful adherents on Wall Street, with two notable ones being Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. At its heart, value investing involves determining the fair or true value of a stock and then comparing it with the market price. If the market price is lower, then an investing decision is made depending on the difference between the two called the margin of safety. The greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels with their decision as it reduces the amount of losses in case of the share price dropping in an untoward event. Stocks that have a fair value that is higher than the market value are called undervalued stocks, and those whose market price is higher are called overvalued stocks - with the market price being the primary determinant of the valuation adjective.\n\nThe next question to ask is, what constitutes a fair value of a stock? Well, one commonly used proxy for this is the analyst share price targets. Sell side financial firms such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) employ analysts whose sole job is to see what the value of a firm's stock can be based on different metrics such as future cash flows. Averaging these price targets aims to remove some of the biases present in a single analyst's analysis and it is often used as a proxy for fair value.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the most undervalued value stocks, we can check to see if investing in undervalued stocks has its merits or not. Well, we don't have to look too far to find a list of undervalued stocks. One such list is Insider Monkey's coverage of 14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now. This list used consensus undervalued stock picks of the financial media and was published in mid September 2023. The average six month share price performance of all the stocks on this list is 19.64% and ranges from 44.64% for Amazon to -22.77% for the lithium provider Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nAlbermarle has suffered amidst a glut in the global lithium industry that has been hurt from oversupply and slow demand, and here's what The London Company had to say about the firm in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nALB underperformed as weak lithium prices drove downward revisions to earnings expectations, and sentiment became more negative regarding demand for electric vehicles. Commodity prices are inherently uncertain, but we continue to view ALB as a winner in this growing industry and favorably positioned on the cost curve. Our long-term view of ALB is not affected by short-term supply-demand dynamics for the commodity.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most undervalued value stocks that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG). 10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued value stocks we first made a list of 40 stocks with P/E ratios under 15 and average analyst percentage share price upside greater than 20%. Then, the 20 stocks with the highest upside were selected, and they were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top stocks were selected.\n\nFor these undervalued value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\n10.

        "title": "Coupang Stock (NYSE:CPNG): Should You Ride This Rocket Higher?",
        "content": "Maybe you\u2019ve seen the trending stock tickers today and noticed that Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock was on a rocket ride higher. There\u2019s nothing wrong with momentum, but investors should look into the reason for the move and make their own decisions. I am bearish on CPNG stock, and as we delve into what\u2019s actually going on with Coupang, you might decide to find better investment opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe easiest way to describe Coupang is as South Korea\u2019s version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It\u2019s a popular e-commerce company with an order-fulfillment service called Rocket Delivery.\n\nCPNG stock was on the move today, and you may be tempted to go all-in on the South Korean Amazon. However, be sure to learn all of the relevant facts before making any investment decisions. After all, a stock can be vulnerable to a pullback if a rally isn\u2019t really justified.\n\nA Bigger Company Could Threaten Coupang\n\nBefore we get into the headline news, there\u2019s a development that prospective Coupang investors can\u2019t afford to ignore. Specifically, a huge company is reportedly taking steps to compete directly with Coupang.\n\nThis company is much bigger than Coupang \u2014 and no, it\u2019s not Amazon. Rather, it\u2019s China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which has a $184.13 billion market cap, as opposed to Coupang\u2019s $38.16 billion market cap.\n\nHere\u2019s the scoop, courtesy of Nikkei\u2019s Kotaro Hosokawa (via TheFly). Apparently, Alibaba plans to invest $1.1 billion \u201cover the next three years to create a logistics network in South Korea.\u201d With this move, Alibaba intends to take on Coupang \u201cby leveraging low prices and speedy deliveries.\u201d\n\nFor an e-commerce business, being threatened by Alibaba in Asia would be like being threatened by Amazon in the U.S. It\u2019s just bad news for Coupang.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba has the capital resources to cause problems for Coupang. Reportedly, Alibaba will build a logistics center in a 180,000-square-meter lot this year, as well as a call center with 300 employees. Plus, Alibaba plans to establish a \u201cpurchasing department to sell local products overseas, aiming to boost exports for 50,000 small South Korean businesses over three years.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the market is simply ignoring this news, as short-term traders are obsessing over a new development with Coupang. Still, big-picture thinkers shouldn\u2019t just dismiss the threat that Alibaba will pose to Coupang in the coming years.\n\nWhy Was Coupang Stock Up 11.5% Today?\n\nSo, here\u2019s the catalyst that caused CPNG stock to rally 11.5% today. As The Korea Times reported, Coupang plans to increase its monthly Wow service (which is similar to Amazon\u2019s Prime service) membership fee from 4,990 South Korean won previously to a new price of 7,890 won (equivalent to approximately $5.74).\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, bear in mind that $5.74 can be a lot of money for families in different regions of the world. Moreover, this is a 58% increase in the monthly Wow service fee.\n\nSurely, Coupang\u2019s customers are now saying \u201cwow\u201d to the \u201cWow\u201d service, but not in a good way. This probably should go without saying, but The Korea Times stated, \u201cMany consumers [are] displeased with [the] steep price hike.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s put this into perspective. Without a doubt, some customers haven\u2019t been particularly happy about Amazon\u2019s Prime membership price hikes throughout the years. However, at least Amazon had the sense to make those price increases somewhat gradual \u2014 not 58% all at once.\n\nMy point is that this could backfire in a big way. In the immediate term, stock traders are probably over-focused on the revenue-generating potential of Coupang\u2019s Wow service price hike. If the company loses angry customers, though, then there could be long-term damage to Coupang\u2019s bottom line. That\u2019s the last thing Coupang needs as Alibaba makes major moves to steal some of the company\u2019s market share in South Korea.\n\nIs Coupang Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CPNG comes in as a Moderate Buy based on\u00a0three Buys and two Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average CPNG stock price target is $21.75, implying 2.35% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CPNG stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Seyon Park of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with an average return of 16.1% per rating and an 89% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider Coupang Stock?\n\nCoupang\u00a0is certainly an intriguing company that might be compared to Amazon. Yet, even the mammoth Amazon didn\u2019t have the audacity to raise its subscription service fee by 58% all at once. Truly, Coupang\u2019s huge price hike is either a brilliant move or just reckless and greedy.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t consider it to be a brilliant move. Coupang needs to keep its customers happy, especially with Alibaba threatening to make a move into Coupang\u2019s home turf. Consequently, even though\u00a0CPNG stock is quickly moving higher, I\u2019m not considering owning it now.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Why Alibaba, JD.com, and PDD Holdings Stocks Were Sliding Today",
        "content": "Chinese stocks fell again today as negative economic news weighed on the sector. This time, China's exports fell more than expected in March, hammering hopes for a recovery in the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nExports are a significant part of the Chinese economy, accounting for roughly 19% of its overall gross domestic product (GDP). They are also seen as a potential bright spot at a time when the Chinese consumer is struggling and the domestic economy is weak.\n\nExports last month fell 7.5%, while imports were down 1.9%. Both numbers significantly missed economist expectations.\n\nThat news weighed on Chinese stocks broadly, and as of 2:23 p.m. ET, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) was down 4%, while JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) had given up 5%, and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) was off by 3.8%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bad news out of China continues\n\nThe Chinese economy has been struggling since the pandemic as strict COVID-19 restrictions weighed on consumer spending, vaccine access was slow to arrive in China, and the economy failed to experience an expected recovery when it dropped its zero-COVID restrictions early last year.\n\nThe export report underscores the weakness out of China and makes it less likely the economy will recover soon. Additionally, U.S. stocks were down sharply today as big banks delivered mixed quarterly results and signaled that high interest rates could start to weigh on the economy.\n\nAlibaba has more international exposure than most Chinese stocks, serving Southeast Asia through Lazada and other international markets through AliExpress. However, the company still depends on consumer and enterprise demand in China as its Chinese e-commerce sites, Tmall and Taobao, comprise roughly half its revenue.\n\nAlibaba also experienced a setback when it abandoned a plan to spin off its cloud computing unit due to U.S. export restrictions on semiconductors. The tech giant could use some help, but a further weakening of the Chinese economy will likely add to its problems.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD.com has found itself in a similar position to Alibaba. Its once-strong growth rate has been sapped since the pandemic, and the company is struggling to compete against more nimble online platforms, like PDD's Pinduoduo and Bytedance, which have been aggressively discounting and taking market share from JD.com.\n\nJD.com's revenue grew just 3.6% in the fourth quarter, and it's struggling to grow its third-party marketplace.\n\nFinally, PDD has been the standout performer in the group. Its revenue is still soaring thanks to strong growth at Pinduoduo and the breakout performance of Temu, which is rapidly gaining market share in the U.S. and other international markets with the help of bargain prices.\n\nWhile those strong results have made PDD stock a winner, that doesn't make it immune from problems in the Chinese economy. The issues are likely to weigh on consumer spending and economic growth across the board.\n\nAre Chinese stocks investable?\n\nMost investors in China have gotten burned in recent years, and while valuations look cheap, many of the risks remain, as indicated in the weak export report.\u00a0In fact, some of them may be getting worse. Just today, China told telecoms to phase out foreign-made chips, which seems likely to intensify a tech war with the U.S. after the U.S. blocked American companies from shipping technologies to China.\n\nThat might not impact these e-commerce platforms directly, but they will likely feel the residual effect of any headwinds on the economy.\n\nIf you're interested in buying Chinese stocks, PDD looks like the best option of the three here, considering its rapid growth and ability to take market share from its peers. However, given the recent challenges that Chinese stocks have faced, taking a small position seems like a prudent strategy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PDD Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PDD Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PDD Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

Max will be introduced in important foreign markets, beginning in Latin America, through rebranding and relaunches in the current European and Latin American markets. By year\u2019s end, an ad-supported product will be accessible in more than 40 regions worldwide.\n\nMoreover, introducing Max in important foreign markets, with relaunches and rebranding initiatives, improves the company\u2019s global presence and market penetration. Additionally, launching ad-supported solutions in some areas increases the company\u2019s reach and possibilities for top-line.\n\nFurther, Warner Bros Discovery\u2019s success in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market results from its ability to take advantage of changing customer tastes and developments in digital streaming. The solid boost in DTC customers worldwide to 97.7 million highlights the company\u2019s ability to draw in and hold onto a sizable user base. In short, a rise of 7% in average top-line per user (ARPU) suggests that monetization tactics are working and that subscribers may be obtained at a greater value.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) BUY spelled out on a computer keyboard representing stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) boosted its financial results through cost-cutting measures. The company wants to maximize its capital investment while cutting operating costs. Some of these projects include personnel reductions, site optimization, and enhancements to pharmacy and retail operating models.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the corporation hopes to save $1 billion in costs, most of which have already been realized in the reporting periods. Additionally, the business intends to achieve\u00a0$500 million in working capital benefits and a $600 million reduction in capital expenditures. These initiatives show the company\u2019s dedication to raising profitability and streamlining its finances.\n\nThe Walgreens Boots Alliance has concentrated on joint ventures and growth prospects to spur growth. The company has strengthened its relationship with domestic suppliers while growing its brand penetration, which is now 17.1%, a boost of 0.95% from the previous year. The company has also magnified its healthcare offerings, including pharmacy services and vaccinations, to address changing customer demands.\n\nFinally, the purchase of Summit Health and the ongoing development of VillageMD will help the company grow its market share in the healthcare industry.\n\nOverlooked Stocks to Buy: Verizon (VZ) Verizon Retail Location. Verizon delivers wireless, high-capacity fiber optics and 5G communications. VZ stock\n\nSource: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ) fulfills changing consumer demands and preferences. This is because of the company\u2019s focus on advancement and personalized services, which also helps it stand out in the industry and spur further development. After extensive user research, Verizon launched myPlan, which has been a huge success.\n\nAs of 2023,\u00a0myPlan has 13.1 million users, demonstrating its ability to boost top-line and adoption. Verizon\u2019s capacity to create customer-focused products that appeal to customers, increasing average top-line per account (ARPA) and customer retention, is also demonstrated by the quick adoption of myPlan.\n\nMoreover, positive outcomes have come from Verizon\u2019s attempts to set itself apart by making lucrative expansion investments and streamlining its processes. Verizon has demonstrated its dedication to operational efficiency and market distinctiveness through many initiatives. These include the establishment of a regional distribution network, a redesign of the sales structure, and\u00a0a partnership with HCLTech.\n\nThrough these moves, Verizon may boost efficiency, save costs, and enhance performance by streamlining processes and optimizing resources.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) white keyboard with \"buy\" written on a green enter key (stocks to buy). Stocks to Buy on Major Deals. stocks with ideal p/e ratios\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is growing in transaction volume progressively, reflecting the company\u2019s expanding market share and usage (in consumers and business clients). Comparing Q4 2023 to Q4 2022, total payment volume (TPV) climbed by 15%. Similarly, 2023 saw a 13% growth in TPV to $1.53 trillion over 2022. The constant uplift in TPV indicates PayPal\u2019s progressive customer engagement and its fundamental capacity to expand its market lead in digital payments.\n\nMoreover, PayPal has demonstrated strong cash flow-generating skills, reflecting its sound financial standing and capacity to fund expansion plans. Operating cash flow for 2023\u00a0was $4.8 billion, of which $4.2 billion was free cash flow.\n\nAdditionally, excluding the net impact of originating European buy now, pay later (BNPL) receivables held for sale and the subsequent sale of these receivables, adjusted free cash flow for Q4 was $0.8 billion, compared to\u00a0$4.6 billion in 2023. Overall, PayPal can derive considerable cash flow on a regular basis. This demonstrates its financial stability and allows it to allocate resources towards strategic goals and long-term growth.\n\nOverlooked Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) top-line increased by 10% in Q4 2023 compared to the prior year. This growth tendency demonstrates the company\u2019s capacity to adjust to changing market conditions and seize new possibilities. Intel\u2019s sales boost shows it is resilient in the semiconductor sector, even in adversity.\n\nIn detail, client computing, data center and AI, network and edge, and automotive are some categories that contribute to Intel\u2019s top-line. For example, the Client Computing Group (CCG) generated $8.8 billion in top-line during the fourth quarter, a 33% boost over the previous year. Similarly, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) produced $4 billion in sales, demonstrating a stable performance in this market.\n\nCertainly,\u00a0AI-capable CPUs like Intel Core Ultra processors and Xeon Scalable processors have been introduced and are geared for AI applications. This demonstrates Intel\u2019s effort to incorporate AI capabilities into its product range. The company\u2019s focus on integrating AI reflects its readiness to meet consumer and market demands.\n\nOverall, Intel is increasing the size of its addressable market and boosting its top-line by meeting the increasing demand for AI-enabled solutions across a range of applications.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) picture of a man circling buy on a stock chart. stock picks. stocks to buy from IBD\u2019s Top 50\n\nSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.com\n\nIn just a few months, Alibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) revenues jumped by 44%, supported by a firm performance in international digital commerce. This accentuates Alibaba\u2019s outstanding success in reaching other markets with its e-commerce presence. Solid growths in the top-line of AIDC show that Alibaba is increasingly capitalizing on opportunities presented in the international e-commerce space, nudging its international expansion ahead.\n\nOn the flip side, logistics under Cainiao, Alibaba\u2019s logistics unit, came under severe scrutiny, which had a cross-cutting effect on the company\u2019s cross-border e-commerce operations. Income for Cainiao grew by 24%, with top-line from cross-border fulfillment solutions being the prime driver.\n\nFurther, Alibaba\u2019s progress is in important overseas areas, including Europe and Turkey. Alibaba\u2019s Turkish e-commerce platform, Trendyol, retained its top spot in the Turkish market with strong double-digit order growth. Alibaba.com has finalized the acquisition of Visible, a B2B digital commerce platform based in Europe, to boost its footprint in Europe further.\n\nTo conclude, these programs show Alibaba\u2019s dedication to global growth and its capacity to take market share in various geographical areas.\n\nJD.Com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company.

        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 7.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.86 points to a change of +11.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.84 indicates a change of -0.3% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $131.2 billion and $140.51 billion estimates indicate +4.1% and +7.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $36.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.46%. The EPS surprise was -2.2%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Searching for the Dawn After Alibaba's Downturn",
        "content": "An investment in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) represents a commitment to a long-term vision rooted in the belief that substantial rewards often emerge from overcoming significant challenges. This investment journey is characterized by periods of volatility and instances where the stock's performance does not accurately mirror the company's fundamentals, as investor sentiment can remain persistently pessimistic.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nThe Chinese company does not fit every investor's portfolio, nor does it mean you cannot beat the market. This requires immense patience and a strong conviction in its long-term potential despite adversity.\n\nThe company is a world leader in technology and e-commerce, giving many positive arguments to those who have the vision to go four or six years ahead, with all that entails, to a better future. As such, Alibaba remains a strategic long-term investment, but the possibility of staying in the red for a long time should have investors rethinking risk tolerance.\n\nThe proverb \"it's always darkest before dawn\" perfectly characterizes the Alibaba investment thesis, highlighting a journey fraught with volatility and periods of significant drawdowns. This path is not for the faint-hearted; it demands resilience and conviction that few possess.\n\nNavigating through FDI 30-year lows and geopolitical shadows\n\nThis is the bottom in Foreign Direct Investment, with the lowest rate levels in China since 1993, part of a cocktail muddied by geopolitics and investor pessimism. These issues have significantly spilled over into the broader economic climate and the market perception and valuation of Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba. However, this situation could signal a potential bottom for the stock. Historically, market bottoms are often formed during extreme pessimism when the outlook appears bleak.\n\nAdditionally, this could serve as a pivotal moment, provided the Chinese government's actions, underscored by Premier Li Qiang's directive for \"pragmatic and forceful\" measures, effectively rebuild confidence in the economy. This signals a clear intention toward initiating structural reforms and stabilization efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose investors closely watching the recovery will follow the FDI figures with due interest to indicate returning confidence in China's market potential. If these efforts bear fruit, Alibaba could indeed be set in for a revival with the exponential growth of its other businesses, capitalizing on its inherent strengths and the eventual revival of investor sentiment.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nIn the eye of the storm\n\nFor Alibaba, these challenges are compounded by regulatory pressures from the sluggish property market and escalating U.S.-China tensions affecting the tech sector. However, opportunities for a rebound and growth had to emerge from the turbulence. Meanwhile, in a waiting game, Alibaba benefits as China pivots to services and technology, but only if Beijing can find a successful middle ground in regulatory policy with real encouragement for private-sector-led innovation.\n\nThe key to Alibaba's potential rebound lies in navigating the current economic headwinds with strategic agility. This is happening despite government efforts to prop the market up with a $278 billion financial rescue package and a 50-basis point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. Critically, Alibaba's future growth is tightly fastened on China's broader economic reforms and its ability to boost demand, encourage innovation and maintain a level playing field for private businesses against state-owned behemoths.\n\nEven though technology's self-sufficiency in chips is challenging, it aims to maximize the value that Alibaba and other technology powerhouses will play in helping China meet its long-term economic goals. The global perspective on an international scale and the landscape are equally complex. Where the U.S. hunkers down on intensified pressure to cut China's tech primacy, notably in semiconductors and artificial intelligence, will offer adversity as much as it does acceleration to companies such as Alibaba.\n\nSuch pressures force a re-evaluation of strategies, pushing for more self-reliance and innovative ways to face adversities. For Joseph Tsai, co-founder of Alibaba, the ability to steer through such geopolitical noise would be paramount if the company continued striving to expand its global market share and flourish despite increased competition and many regulatory hurdles.\n\nDespite the current uncertainties, there are reasons for cautious optimism. The tech sector's strategic importance to the national economy and its dominance in global exports signal support for companies like Alibaba to continue, albeit within the bounds of broader economic and geopolitical considerations. Therefore, at this point, the long-term outlook for the company, including regulations, market reforms and the global economic environment, is finely balanced.\n\nSurging PMI signals economic revival ahead\n\nMarch revived China's manufacturing activity, signaling a possible turnaround in the world's largest trading nation's economic fortunes. That rebound, reflected in a rise in the Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index and the highest reading of the official government PMI for a year, might signal the beginning of somelight at the end of the economic tunnel for a region that has been parched of growth.\n\nOn Sunday, the National Bureau of Statistics announced the official manufacturing purchasing managers index climbed to 50.80 in March, up from 49.10 in February. This exceeded the median forecast of 50.10 predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. Hence, this marked the highest PMI reading since March of the previous year, signaling a notable improvement in the sector.\n\nHence, the manufacturing resurgence fuels optimism, and a five-month expansion in manufacturing activity would highlight momentum that may spearhead the pickup of the world's second-biggest economy and the most extended sequence of gains in more than two years. Searching for the Dawn After Alibaba's Downturn\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nSeizing the moment amid China's economic reawakening\n\nIt is a renaissance at the crossroads in the making, presenting a ray of hope for the tech giant at the heart of China's economic storm. Navigating regulatory headwinds and market uncertainties, the company uniquely positioned itself to leverage the upturn in industrial and market demand.\n\nAs China steps up efforts to revive domestic demand and promote industrial upgrading, Alibaba can seize this moment by strengthening the recovery trajectory and, as a result, broader economic reforms and the revival of activities that the stimulus might bring on.\n\nFinally, for Alibaba, this could herald a sharp rebound underpinned as much by China's deeper economic reforms as by a newfound need for tech-driven solutions. As China grapples with balancing much-needed immediate economic stimulus and the imperative long-term structural reforms, companies like Alibaba will stand at the vanguard of this country's transformational journey.\n\nTakeaway\n\nIn conclusion, while Alibaba faces a challenging path ahead, its potential for rebound and growth remains intact. The company's fortunes are likely to depend heavily on China's ability to effectively tackle current economic woes, make meaningful reforms and usher in an environment that would offer space for innovation and growth in the private sector. Hence, this would pave the path ahead for Alibaba and its investors, with strategic vision and resilience giving it all the more potential to make a robust recovery.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Alibaba founder Jack Ma is giving his e-commerce company and its executives some much-needed praise. Just over a year ago, the Chinese tech giant announced an ambitious restructuring plan\u2014only to hit stumbles due to new domestic competition, a management reshuffle, and geopolitical rivalry. But on Wednesday, Ma took to Alibaba's internal forums to express strong support for the company's direction\u2014and gave the company's shares a boost.\n\nIn his post, Ma said Alibaba was embracing a more aggressive start-up mindset. \u201cWe are starting to operate on the diseases of a big company,\u201d Ma wrote, according to a translation from Bloomberg. While Alibaba once suffered from \u201cslow decision-making,\u201d it is now a firm \u201cwhere efficiency and market leadership are paramount, making our company once again simple and agile,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMa also praised Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu and chair Joseph Tsai, two Alibaba co-founders who took the reins of the company in a September management reshuffle.\n\nInvestors seem to be thrilled by Ma\u2019s show of support. The company's Hong Kong-traded shares jumped 4.9% in Wednesday trading. The broader Hang Seng Index, which tracks the largest companies traded in Hong Kong, rose 1.9%.\n\nAfter years of staying out of the spotlight, Ma is starting to comment more regularly on Alibaba's direction.\n\nMa wrote a post company\u2019s internal forum last November, where he called on employees to help the company \u201ccorrect its course\u201d in the face of fierce competition from PDD. \u201cEvery great company is born in a winter,\u201d he wrote at the time.\n\nMa backed up his call with his wallet, by reportedly buying $50 million worth of Alibaba shares in the last quarter of 2023. Tsai\u2019s family office also bought an additional $150 million worth of shares.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s restructuring woes\n\nJust over a year ago, Alibaba announced an ambitious restructuring plan, where it would pursue IPOs and listings for its six different divisions. But the company's new executives are revising those plans amid a weak IPO environment and renewed competition in e-commerce, its core business.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn mid-November, the company abandoned plans to spin off its lucrative cloud computing division as an independent company. The company blamed expanded U.S. controls barring the sale of advanced chips to Chinese companies.\n\nThen in March, Alibaba withdrew plans to list its Cainiao logistics unit on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange. Instead, the company will take full ownership of the division. \u201cWe believe this is an appropriate time to double down\u201d on logistics, Tsai said at the time.\n\nThe company is also focusing on reinvigorating its e-commerce division amid a slower Chinese economy and new competition from companies like PDD. In late December, CEO Eddie Wu took direct control of Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce operations.\n\nAlibaba reported $36.6 billion in revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023, a 5% increase year-on-year. \u201cOur top priority is to reignite the growth of our two core businesses: e-commerce and cloud computing,\u201d Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu told analysts during an earnings call in February.\n\nIn his recent post, Ma suggested that Alibaba's restructuring would remain tough. \"This path of reform and innovation has never been accompanied by applause,\" he wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma took to an internal Alibaba forum to voice his support for a company undergoing a turbulent restructuring, emerging from seclusion for the second time in months to try and shore up sagging morale at the Chinese e-commerce pioneer he co-created.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes Apple\u2019s India iPhone Output Hits $14 Billion in China Shift Iran\u2019s Better, Stealthier Drones Are Remaking Global Warfare\n\nThe billionaire, who had retreated from the public spotlight in recent years, penned a lengthy memo in which he blessed efforts by new leaders Joseph Tsai and Eddie Wu to revive a stalled company. He said Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is now on the right track and urged staff to stay the course.\n\nMa, who\u2019s still revered by many of the company\u2019s 200,000-plus employees, struck a markedly more upbeat tone than just four months ago, when he spoke up for the first time in years only to criticize its direction and laud a rival.\n\nThis time, he reiterated calls to think outside the box and escape the \u201cbig company trap.\u201d But he emphasized growth was returning and Alibaba was moving forward despite flip-flops over the past year, for instance on first pushing then nixing the listings of its Cainiao logistics arm and $11 billion cloud business. Alibaba\u2019s shares rose almost 4.9% in Hong Kong, or the most in about two months.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to operate on the diseases of a big company, returning again from an organization that makes decisions slowly back to the highest levels of efficiency and a market-first approach, to once again allow the company to be simple and agile,\u201d Ma wrote in a memo that the company also distributed to staff.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nAlibaba may focus on providing valued services to customers vs. achieving internal targets, with a likely focus on e-commerce, cloud and AI which were specifically named in founder Jack Ma\u2019s rare internal company memo dated April 10. This raises the likelihood it will cede fiscal 2025 profit gains to boost revenue growth in select businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nAlibaba, which is grappling with the aftermath of bruising regulatory crackdown and Covid-era turmoil, is trying to revitalize a sprawling empire that spans e-commerce and cloud services. Since ushering out former CEO Daniel Zhang, Tsai and Wu have focused on trying to integrate its separate parts while shedding marginal assets to focus on core businesses.\n\nMa\u2019s first memo in November was viewed as a signal of a gradual return to public life, breaking about two years of silence after clashing with Beijing. For many Alibaba employees, it\u2019s a welcome change at a time the company is struggling with direction.\n\nMa didn\u2019t drill down into specifics, or directly address some of the more fundamental questions surrounding the internet company he built into China\u2019s most valuable corporation \u2014 before Beijing and Covid wiped out growth.\n\nIt\u2019s still bleeding market share to rivals such as PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd. At the same time,the likes of Baidu Inc. are pushing forward into the potentially transformative AI arena. Alibaba posted a lower-than-projected 5% rise in December quarter revenue \u2014 well off the pace of previous years.\n\nRead More: Jack Ma Returns to Rally Troops as Alibaba\u2019s Troubles Deepen\n\nIn response, the company green-lit a $25 billion buyback program to appease investors. Tsai has said Alibaba will focus on integrating its various businesses and regaining its market dominance, rather than on working through major deals or IPOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ma referenced a video interview with his longtime lieutenant Tsai. In the chat with shareholder Norges Bank posted last week, Tsai talked about how Alibaba shouldn\u2019t be afraid to admit past mistakes.\n\nSince he took over Alibaba from Zhang, the company has reshuffled the managers at most of its major divisions \u2014 including the original commerce arm \u2014 and explored the sale of non-core assets such as physical retail operators.\n\n\u201cThis path of reform and innovation has never been accompanied by applause, because what we are changing are the bad habits we love the most and what we are reforming is our vested interest,\u201d Ma wrote.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s profit surged roughly 60% in 2023, outpacing the growth of online peers Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in a sign of the TikTok owner\u2019s resilience in the face of an economic downturn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Iran\u2019s Better, Stealthier Drones Are Remaking Global Warfare Trumpism Is Emptying Churches Ukraine Says It\u2019s Behind Blaze on Russian Warship in Baltic Sea\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization jumped to more than $40 billion from about $25 billion in 2022, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private information. The world\u2019s most valuable startup also grew sales to nearly $120 billion from $80 billion, the people said.\n\nThe results mark the first time that ByteDance has overtaken archrival Tencent both in revenue and profit, as it leveraged its popular short-video platforms to expand into international e-commerce and sustain its global popularity. While ByteDance\u2019s internal figures haven\u2019t been independently audited, they suggest the ad-churning social media juggernaut became one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing tech giants in 2023.\n\nA ByteDance spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe owner of TikTok and Chinese twin Douyin last year cemented its position as one of China\u2019s internet leaders, alongside Tencent and Alibaba, which have both struggled to rekindle growth at a time of economic uncertainty and consumer wariness in the country.\n\nIn the domestic market, Douyin is morphing into an all-in-one platform akin to Tencent\u2019s WeChat, with its added features encroaching on Alibaba\u2019s ecommerce turf and competing with Meituan for food delivery orders. Even with the strong results, ByteDance decided to overhaul management of its China operations in February, with Kelly Zhang stepping down from the chief executive role without plans for appointing a successor.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverseas, the successful rollout of TikTok Shop in markets like the US and Southeast Asia have unlocked new revenue sources beyond digital marketing. TikTok is seeking to grow the size of its US ecommerce business tenfold this year. It has 170 million users in the country.\n\nThat\u2019s despite TikTok\u2019s existential crisis in its most lucrative market. In March, the US House of Representatives passed a bill to ban TikTok in the US unless ByteDance sells its prized asset, though the measure faces a less certain outcome in the Senate. The presidential rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump later in the year, along with Beijing\u2019s response, could also complicate matters.\n\nLike its China peers, ByteDance has started to unwind risky bets in recent months. It has cut hundreds of jobs at its gaming development and enterprise software units, which dragged profitability and largely failed to live up to their promises. Instead, the company is trying to catch up on generative AI, building its own chatbots and large language model.\n\nByteDance\u2019s long-awaited stock market debut remains a distant possibility, as the company grapples with elevated scrutiny in the US. In December, the firm offered to buy back up to $5 billion in shares from investors at a valuation of $268 billion. At its peak, ByteDance was valued at more than $400 billion in some private trading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit\u2014With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "By Casey Hall\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has penned a rare lengthy memo to employees that expresses support for the internet giant's restructuring efforts, a sign that he may be willing to take a more active role after spending the last few years out of the spotlight.\n\nAlibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares surged 5.5% in morning trade after the post, on course for their biggest one-day percentage gain since Feb. 6.\n\nIn the post, which was roughly a page long, Ma praised the leadership of CEO Eddie Wu and chairman Joe Tsai and said the company's split into six divisions a year ago had helped streamline decision-making, making Alibaba more agile and customer-focused.\n\nMa, China's best-known tech entrepreneur, publicly criticised Chinese regulators in a speech in October 2020, derailing a massive listing by fintech company Ant Group, which he also founded. That was followed by regulatory crackdowns on the Chinese tech sector with Ma largely withdrawing from public life.\n\n\"Our innovation has never been to surpass our opponents, but to catch up to the future,\" he wrote in the post. \"Innovation is not about following the trend, it's a test of your true ability to survive.\"\n\n(Reporting by Casey Hall; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

        "title": "7 Mega-Cap Stocks Poised to Double Your Money in 3 Years",
        "content": "Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they\u2019ve been responsible for the lion\u2019s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So, \u00a0a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies.\n\nThe other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability.\n\nThose are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let\u2019s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it\u2019s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.\n\nThe logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD\u2019s price, which was roughly $130 at that time.\n\nThat would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let\u2019s start by running through that quickly.\n\nAnalysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let\u2019s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026\u00a0 and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML\u2019s products and their relation to current trends. It\u2019s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.\n\nASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it\u2019s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe\u2019s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,\u00a0 is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here.\n\nNow is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That\u2019s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected.\n\nThe result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That\u2019s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There\u2019s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider.\n\nTesla (TSLA) The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0 stock at the moment. there\u2019s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it\u2019s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk\u2019s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting.\n\nBeyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won\u2019t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future.\n\nHowever, it isn\u2019t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its strong growth, it\u2019s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here.\n\nLet\u2019s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.\n\nNvidia\u2019s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious.\n\nMore likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nCould Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?\u00a0 The answer is a resounding: \u201cYes!\u201d\n\nToyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company\u2019s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It\u2019s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data.\n\nThat got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn\u2019t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.\n\nAs the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company\u2019s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That\u2019s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let\u2019s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba\u2019s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that it\u2019ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba\u2019s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it\u2019s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The competition among Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is heating up, as Moonshot AI, a 12 month old start-up, has overtaken Alibaba Group Holding's Tongyi Qianwen and is narrowing the gap with domestic leader Baidu's Ernie Bot, according to new data.\n\nMoonshot AI's Kimi saw total traffic to its website and app reach 12.6 million views in March, more than quadruple the number from a month earlier, according to AIcpb.com, a site that tracks the popularity of AI products worldwide.\n\nAs a result, Kimi overtook Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen to become China's second-largest chatbot, only behind Baidu's Ernie Bot in the top spot. AIcpb.com data showed that Ernie Bot attracted nearly 15 million views last month, up 48 per cent, while the Alibaba service had 5.2 million visits, up 44 per cent.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nLi Bangzhu, founder of AIcpb.com, said that unlike Baidu and Alibaba's products that are often used for general purposes, Kimi is known for \"dealing with specific scenarios\" such as analysing long text, which may contribute to its popularity.\n\nBut \"Kimi isn't going to overtake Ernie Bot any time soon, because the latter has a very huge [user] base\", which is still growing, Li added.\n\nNevertheless, Chinese generative AI giants still lag far behind global leaders. In March, total traffic to OpenAI's ChatGPT rose 9 per cent to 1.86 billion views, remaining the world's most popular generative AI app, according to AIcpb.com.\n\nMoonshot AI's Kimi chatbot is rapidly growing in popularity.

Photo: Handout>\n\nThe surge in traffic to Moonshot AI's Kimi was so big that it resulted in an outage last month that lasted for at least two days. It was triggered by an announcement of a technological breakthrough that can process up to 2 million Chinese characters during conversations, up from 200,000 characters previously.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Baidu and Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, have followed suit. Baidu said it would update the Ernie Bot this month, enabling it to process up to 5 million Chinese characters, according to Chinese media Chinastarmarket.cn, while in March Alibaba announced that Tongyi Qianwen was capable of handling texts of around 10 million Chinese characters.\n\nBesides developing in-house large language models, Alibaba has invested in emerging rivals, including Moonshot AI and MiniMax.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "China is home to one of the biggest economies in the world, and after lifting its long, strict COVID regulations, it is on the rebound. Despite slow growth in the second half of last year, which caused many stocks to take a hit, some stocks have still persevered and produced excellent results.\n\nThese three Chinese stocks have managed to overcome the economic difficulties affecting industries and continue to hold some of the best buy ratings for this year. Investors should consider these stocks for their potential with growing market shares and dominant selling performances in their respective sectors.\n\nLet\u2019s learn about these stocks\u2019 resilience, growth prospects and reassuring financials, which have earned them Strong Buy ratings and should put them at the top of investors\u2019 lists this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPDD Holdings(PDD) Smartphone displaying orange Temu logo in a miniature shopping cart against a yellow background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/yanishevska\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) owns and operates some of the largest e-commerce platforms in China and the world. Its most popular platform is Temu, which has the second-most monthly users behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nPDD took a slight hit earlier this year, but after a Q4 earnings beat, the stock saw a considerable boost. Investors were excited by the company\u2019s Q4 revenue of $12.52 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.40.\n\nThis stock\u2019s Strong Buy ratings also come from the optimistic consensus estimates. The company is predicted to see a 35% increase in earnings growth this year and a significant jump in revenue on top of its rebound.\n\nPDD has a dominant hold over the e-commerce market in China and continues to show impressive growth. Investors should buy now and watch as this stock takes off this year.\n\nAlibaba Group (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is another e-commerce giant based in China. Like many competitors, Alibaba has seen its fair share of trouble alongside the struggling Chinese economy. However, estimates remain confident that this stock will be among the first to return to the top with a hopeful 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese estimates are fueled by Alibaba\u2019s extensive market share and continued performance despite the hurdles standing in its way. The most recent quarterly earnings report boasts $36.669 billion in revenue, showing a 5% growth from the previous year.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the best growth, considering the economic pressure, Alibaba has showcased some of the best perseverance out of Chinese stocks. In addition, to reignite its stock price, Alibaba shared its massive share buyback initiative involving repurchasing 524 million ordinary shares during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nWith its low price, now is a great time to buy Alibaba, believing in its proven ability to make an exciting return this year.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the significant Chinese competitors to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) reported a fantastic 2023 despite economic slowdowns and high spending. In Q4, Li Auto reported a 133.8% increase in sales from Q4 2022.\n\nThe show didn\u2019t stop there. Not only did Li Auto see an 182.2% increase in deliveries, but it also reported a free cash flow of $6.22 billion in 2023, a 1,861.8 % year-over-year increase. That\u2019s enormous growth despite much higher operating expenses following its first fully electric EV release.\n\nThat cash flow, in line with Li Auto\u2019s current price, makes it a criminally underrated stock, with a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 6.5. Though the company does not expect as massive of growth this year as 2023, many other EV makers report the same.\n\nAll things considered, Li Auto is too good of a deal and has prospects too promising for investors to pass up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "This Fast-Growing Company Just Repurchased $4.8 Billion in Shares -- Its Second-Biggest Quarterly Buyback Ever. Should Investors Jump on the Stock?",
        "content": "Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) announced on April 2 that it made $4.8 billion in share repurchases in the first quarter of 2024, the second-largest quarterly share buyback in its history.\u00a0This is likely a down payment on the $25 billion increase in the share buyback program revealed in its fourth-quarter 2023 earnings announcement in February.\n\nHowever, the market's reaction to this news was tepid, and as of this writing, the stock has fallen on the news. This continues Alibaba's struggles, a stock that has suffered a net loss since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014. Knowing its history, is the share repurchase the move the Chinese e-commerce retailer and cloud service provider needs to inspire a recovery, or should investors remain on the sidelines? BABA data by YCharts.\n\nWhy the buyback will not matter to some investors\n\nFrom a certain point of view, investors' non-reaction to the massive stock buyback is unsurprising. This is because the move does nothing to address the perception that Alibaba and other Chinese stocks are uninvestable.\n\nThis sentiment stems from the precarious state of U.S.-China relations. The problem directly affected the investment world in 2022 when U.S. regulators threatened to delist Alibaba and several other Chinese stocks if they could not access Chinese companies' audits.\n\nThat situation added risk to Alibaba since Alibaba shares are not a direct ownership stake in the company. Instead, Alibaba and many other international stocks are American depositary receipts (ADRs), shares issued by a bank that has a business relationship with Alibaba. Although ADRs typically benefit shareholders, they become riskier if the odds of delisting rise.\n\nFortunately for Alibaba and other stocks, an agreement between the U.S. and China averted the removal of Chinese shares. However, it also served as a reminder of the risks of owning Alibaba stock.\n\nMoreover, Alibaba has been at odds with China's government in recent years. In 2020, the government began an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, which led to an 18 billion renminbi ($2.8 billion) fine in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, around the time that founder Jack Ma stepped down as chairman of Alibaba Group, he disappeared for several months after criticizing the Chinese government. That coincided with the cancelation of the IPO of Ant Group, an affiliate company of Alibaba run by Ma, which was another major setback for the parent company.\n\nMaking sense of the Alibaba risk premium\n\nNonetheless, despite the many challenges, investors are also right to question whether the risks are already priced into Alibaba stock. As mentioned, shares have lost value over the last decade. Still, during that time, revenue grew from 19 billion renminbi ($2.6 billion) in 2013 to 260 billion renminbi ($36 billion) in 2023, a 13-fold increase in 10 years.\n\nAlso, net income rose from 8 billion renminbi ($1.2 billion) in 2013 to 46 billion renminbi ($6.3 billion) last year. While that is slightly more than a fivefold gain, it is remarkable that the stock is worth less despite that growth.\n\nSo deep is the multiple compression that a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that routinely exceeded 40 in its early years now stands at just 13. Although that earnings multiple includes a significant discount for the risks involved, a recovery could bring outsize gains. That possibility may prompt some investors to buy into the share repurchase. BABA PE Ratio data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nDoes the repurchase make Alibaba stock a buy?\n\nDue to the geopolitical risks involved, risk-averse investors should avoid Alibaba stock under any circumstances. However, risk-tolerant investors willing to take a chance on the stock could make a case for investing speculative funds in Alibaba.\n\nAlthough investors should not dismiss risk, risk premiums have a limit, and Alibaba has arguably reached beyond that level. With the financials showing massive growth not reflected in the stock price, Alibaba could deliver significant returns simply by averting worst-case scenarios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is cutting prices for cloud customers from the US to Singapore by as much as 59%, mirroring deep discounts at home as the once high-flying division struggles to fend off rivals and revive growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrumpism Is Emptying Churches RBC Fires CFO Ahn After Probe Into Personal Relationship The Odds of $100 Oil Are Rising as Supply Shocks Convulse the Market Israel Backs Out of Khan Younis to Prepare \u2018Future Operations\u2019 Saudis Scale Back Ambition for $1.5 Trillion Desert Project Neom\n\nThe move coincides with a surge in demand for cloud computing to support a global boom in AI development, as well as a complicated internal restructuring. Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu is spearheading a far-reaching overhaul to try and revitalize Alibaba\u2019s main businesses including ecommerce. Alibaba canceled plans for a public listing of the cloud business in November, citing difficulties getting the high-end Nvidia Corp. chips it needs to compete, and has faced rising competition from Tencent Holdings Ltd. and state-backed providers.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based firm slashed prices on Monday by an average of 23% for around 500 cloud product specifications. Those discounts are now available to customers in 13 regions, including Japan, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates and Germany.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares in Hong Kong pared gains after the announcement to trade about 0.5% up.\n\nAlibaba is China\u2019s biggest cloud service provider, but a relatively small player compared to global leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. It has lost market share in China to state-backed rivals and struggled to gain any ground abroad in recent years as a crackdown on internet firms in China and US trade curbs hampered its expansion. Revenue at the cloud division, which surpassed $11 billion in its last full fiscal year, is projected to slip 2% in the March quarter.\n\nChairman Joe Tsai acknowledged in an interview with major shareholder Norges Bank last week that US chip curbs posed a \u201cbig issue\u201d for Chinese cloud providers. While stockpiled inventories can still be used to train large language models for the next 12 to 18 months, limited access to Nvidia\u2019s best-in-class AI hardware will impact the companies in the short to medium term before there are strong domestic alternatives, Tsai said.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nAlibaba\u2019s price cuts for ex-China cloud services affirms a greater focus on revenue growth vs. profitability this fiscal year ending March 2025. Consensus estimates for a two-percentage-point rise in the business\u2019 2025 adjusted Ebita margin from a year earlier appear overly optimistic.\n\n\u2014 Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, BI analysts\n\nRead More: Alibaba Starts Its Cloud Arm Overhaul After Nixing Spinoff\n\nThe changes follow Alibaba\u2019s domestic price cuts for more than 100 core cloud offerings by as much as 55% in February. Those spurred a price war, as rivals like JD.com Inc. responded with their own rounds of discounts. February also marked Alibaba\u2019s second major price cut in recent months.\n\nCloud executives on Monday said that new and existing international customers would enjoy the new discounts, including cutting a one-year data storage package popular among small businesses from $63 to $16.99. The company also said it would increase discounts and commission rates for resellers, as well as making its artificial intelligence computing platform PAI-Lingjun available in Singapore.\n\n\u201cOur latest pricing strategy is designed not only to reward long-term subscribers with more substantial discounts, but also to ensure that businesses can have a stable foundation to develop their long-term strategies when planning and developing their own AI applications,\u201d Selina Yuan, president of the cloud unit\u2019s international business arm, said in a statement.\n\n(Updates with analyst reaction)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "One of the most disappointing international stocks over the past five years undoubtedly has been Chinese e-commerce, logistics, and technology infrastructure company Alibaba (NYSE: BABA). While the S&P 500 has risen over 80% over that time, Alibaba stock is down nearly 60%.\n\nOver that period, Alibaba has been able to grow both revenue and earnings. For its most recent quarter, ended December 2023, the company reported revenue of $36.7 billion and adjusted earnings per American depository share (ADS) of $2.67. That's decidedly better than its December 2018 quarter, when it recorded revenue of $17.1 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.77.\n\nBelow, I'll look at why the stock has been beaten down and where it could be headed in the next five years.\n\nWhy the stock has fallen\n\nPart of Alibaba's underperformance during the last five years can be tied to the poor performance of the overall Chinese stock market during that period. The S&P China 500 is down about 24% over the past five years. During this period, COVID-related lockdowns impacted China longer than many other countries, which has had a lasting impact on its economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese government also began cracking down on Chinese tech firms during this time. In 2021, the government fined Alibaba over $2.5 billion for being a monopoly, while last year, it fined Alibaba's affiliate Ant Group nearly $1 billion for breaking banking regulations. Meanwhile, company founder Jack Ma retired in 2019 and left public life for a few years after criticizing the Chinese government in 2020.\n\nOverall, a weak Chinese stock market, slowing growth, government regulations, and the loss of the company's well-respected founder have helped push Alibaba stock lower.\n\nCheap valuation and potential spinoffs\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just over 8, Alibaba is a value stock at this point. It has often been call the Amazon of China, given their similar businesses, but the valuation gap between the two is substantial. Amazon is trading at nearly 43 times its forward P/E. Chinese-specific risks play a large part in the valuation difference between the stocks, but it wasn't that long ago when Alibaba traded at a forward P/E in the 20 to 30 range.\n\nStory continues BABA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOne big thing to look at with Alibaba is its cash position and free-cash-flow generation. At the end of 2023, it had $68.6 billion in net cash while it was generating free cash flow of about $25 billion a year. Over the next five years, the company's cash-flow generation and current net cash could be worth more than Alibaba's current $176 billion market capitalization.\n\nAlibaba has also discussed splitting the company into six separate businesses that would be run by separate CEOs and pursue initial public offerings (IPOs) and separate financing. So far, this plan has been delayed.\n\nThe company stated that market conditions would not be reflective of the intrinsic value of the businesses, such as its superstore Hema or its Cainiao logistics business. Last November, meanwhile, the company scrapped plans to IPO its cloud business because of U.S. export bans on artificial-intelligence (AI) chips going to China. Image source: Getty Images\n\nWhere Alibaba could be in five years\n\nGiven Alibaba's cash on hand and cash-flow generation, it would be surprising if the company wasn't trading at a much higher price in five years. There's also a good chance that it will be restructured as a holding company with a number of publicly traded individual businesses. This should unlock value for shareholders, as the individual businesses would likely be able to command higher valuation multiplies because each business would be valued on its own individual growth prospects.\n\nThe Chinese economy, meanwhile, is showing signs of stabilizing, with the manufacturing sector recently returning to growth after five months of declines. An improving Chinese economy should go a long way in helping a variety of Alibaba's consumer-facing and logistics businesses.\n\nAt the same time, Alibaba won't sit still and will invest in AI technology to improve its business operations. The company won't get the same benefits as U.S. companies with access to powerful graphics processing units because of the U.S. export curb, but it still should be able to make progress on this front.\n\nGiven this backdrop, Alibaba should be a solid investment over the next five years. That said, there are certainly geopolitical and country-specific risks that need to be taken into consideration. Any tensions between the U.S. and China could negatively impact the company's stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 dirt cheap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nFollowing a notable surge in the broader market throughout 2023, numerous analysts and financial experts are forecasting an impending correction in 2024. Despite such predictions, the market continues to exhibit robust performance and resilience. The S&P 500 closed out the first quarter of the year with an over 10% gain. BlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Managing Director, Tony DeSpirito, believes that a pullback won\u2019t be surprising but keeps a bullish view on the rest of the year. He adds that stocks are set to outperform bonds and cash again this year while advising investors some caution with their equity choices. He believes that \u201cthe opportunity set for stock picking is the most robust\u201d he has seen in 20 years. Tony DeSpirito\u2019s firm sees some secular trends in the market that provide a bullish view on the broader market for the next three to five years. BlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Q2 2024 equity market outlook suggests long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence, clean energy (including utilities and EVs), and the healthcare industries.\n\nPrincipal Asset Management\u2019s CIO, George Marris, also sees signs of a healthy future in the markets. In a CNBCinterview on April 3, he said that while the recent performance of the stock market was credited to a few stocks, he expects a broadening in the market and favors cyclically exposed stocks. Marris forecasts opportunities in industrials, commodities, and UK-listed companies, along with the Chinese and Japanese markets. Among the foreign companies, George Marris believes that there are several UK-based multinational companies that have a geographic footprint similar to the ones in the US and are trading at cheap multiples. He added that in Japan, his firm sees a significant level of corporate reform due to \u201csocietal pressure and domestic activism\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities in Asian Markets\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, is also showing confidence in the Japanese market, and his firm is upbeat about five specific stocks. The stocks include ITOCHU Corporation (8001.T), Mitsubishi Corporation (8058.T), Sumitomo Corporation (8053.T), Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (8031.T), and Marubeni Corporation (8002.T). In Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett revealed that the firm increased its stake in all five of these companies in 2023 and owns about 9% of each. He wrote:\n\n\u201cIn certain important ways, all five companies \u2013 Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo \u2013 follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily practiced in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the number of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about their own compensation than is typical in the United States. Note as well that each of the five is applying only about 1\u20443 of its earnings to dividends. The large sums the five retain are used both to build their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five companies are reluctant to issue shares.\n\nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to opportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected companies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs have the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be instantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.\u201d\n\nWhile navigating China\u2019s economy, we reported that the position of the Chinese market holds significant importance to the global market as it is responsible for 10% of the world stock market capitalization and trade, 18% of the world GDP, and 16% of global oil demand. IMF sees several growth opportunities in China due to its ongoing infrastructure development and globalization efforts and believes that if current conditions persist, China could see a 20% expansion of the real economy over the next 15 years.\n\nIn February, we covered the best Chinese stocks to buy, and some of the cheap stocks among them include Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.73, 12.89, and 13.48, at the time of writing on April 3, respectively.\n\nAs experts provide a forecast of market broadening, several stocks trading at cheap multiples could provide significant entry points for investors. Some of these dirt cheap stocks include Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR). Also, check out the 10 Best Affordable Stocks Under $10. 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to find large to mega-cap stocks with Buy or equivalent analyst recommendations and trailing 12-month (TTM) price-to-earnings ratios (PE) of under 10, as of April 3. We narrowed down our selection to 12 stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\n12. Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 9.75\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is a Fortune 500 company that designs and builds luxury homes and offers its services in 24 states in the U.S. in more than 60 markets. The company provides its services through its brands, Toll Brothers Active Adult, Toll Brothers Apartment Living, Toll Brothers Campus Living, and Toll Brothers City Living.\n\nOn March 13, Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) increased its quarterly dividend by 9.5% to $0.23, and it is payable by April 19 to the shareholders of record on April 5. As of April 3, the stock\u2019s dividend yield is 0.67%.\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) has a PE ratio of 9.75 as of April 3. Hedge fund sentiment was positive toward the stock in Q4 of 2023, with 49 hedge funds with investments in the stock at a stake value of $1.241 billion. This is compared to 39 funds with positions worth $897.737 million in the previous quarter. As of December 31, 2023, Edgar Wachenheim\u2019s Greenhaven Associates is the biggest shareholder in the company, with a position worth $569.969 million.\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is one of the dirt cheap stocks that caught the attention of hedge funds in the fourth quarter of 2023, along with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR).\n\nBaron Funds stated the following regarding Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe share prices of our investments in homebuilder companies \u2013 Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) , D.R. Horton, Inc., and Lennar Corporation \u2013 gained 39.4%, 41.8%, and 33.2%, respectively, in the most recent quarter, in part due to the continuation of strong quarterly business results, management optimism about 2024 prospects, and a more than 100 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates during the quarter.\n\n2023 was an excellent year for the public homebuilders. Housing fundamentals were resilient despite the affordability challenges of elevated mortgage rates and home prices. Several years of pent-up demand, fears that mortgage rates could move higher, a dearth of inventory in the existing home market, and an overall housing supply shortage drove home buyers off the sidelines to \u201cstretch their wallet,\u201d in part due to fears that they could miss out on the opportunity to buy a home. The Fund\u2019s homebuilding companies Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar increased 108.0%, 71.4%, and 66.3%, respectively, in 2023.\n\nThough we anticipate more modest gains for the Fund\u2019s homebuilder investments in 2024, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar. Further, we continue to believe there is a compelling case for the homebuilder valuations to re-rate higher over time.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, D.R. Horton, Lennar, and Toll Brothers have demonstrated substantial resilience and operating prowess. Despite several black swan events \u2013 COVID-19, a sharp increase in mortgage rates from 3% to 8%, and supply-chain disruptions \u2013 each company has managed its business exceptionally well and demonstrated that the demand to buy homes is resilient.\u201d\n\n11.

(NYSE:HPQ)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 8.70\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is a California-based company that provides personal systems, printers, and 3D printing solutions.

(NYSE:DAL)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 6.50\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53\n\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) offers passenger and cargo scheduled air transportation and operates through Airline and Refinery segments. The company operates flights to over 290 destinations on six continents and had 190 million customers in 2023.\n\nOn April 1, Morgan Stanley raised the price target on Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) to $85 from $77 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Furthermore, the firm increased its \u201cbull case valuation\u201d for the company\u2019s shares to $110 from $90.\n\nThe company is one of the dirt cheap stocks to buy, with a PE multiple of 6.50, as of April 3. 53 hedge funds had stakes in Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) in the fourth quarter of 2023, with total positions worth $1.56 billion. With 6.798 million shares worth $273,483 million, GMT Capital is the most prominent shareholder in the company as of Q4 2023.\n\nPatient Capital Management made the following comment about Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAirlines returned to trough multiples as higher oil prices pressured costs. Historically, airlines have passed these costs on to customers. We think Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) is a premium brand valued like its economics aren\u2019t sustainable. With mid-teens returns on capital, significant free cash flow generation, excellent capital allocation and long-term earnings per share growth in the high-single to low-double-digits, we think the company is significantly mispriced.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) reversed course in the third quarter, falling 24% from its highs in July. The airlines in general were hurt from rising commodity prices that are leading to increased cost per available seat mile (CASM). Historically, airlines have passed on higher fuel prices to customers with a lag. We see Delta as a premium global consumer brand that is materially misunderstood by the market. The market still sees airlines as a cyclical, bankruptcy prone industry. An improved supply-demand picture, management discipline and a better business mix make Delta a more resilient business. Their loyalty program with American Express is a source of stable and growing revenues with $6.5B in remunerations this year with a goal of reaching $10B by the end of the contract in 2028. Premium and ancillary service revenue should generate 65-70% of the total in the next year or two. The company should continue to generate consistent mid-teens returns on capital. As the market begins to understand, we believe the company will continue to be rewarded. On top of this, free cash flow is expected to expand generating a cumulative ~$11B from \u201923-\u201925, or one-half of its current market cap. As the company pays down debt while growing the dividend and eventually resuming share repurchases, we think the stock will continue to trend higher.\u201d\n\n7. First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 2.02\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA), through its wholly-owned subsidiary First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, offers retail and commercial banking services. The company has over 500 branches in 23 states. As of April 3, the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 2.02x.\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) has received Buy ratings from 6 Wall Street analysts over the past three months. The average price target of $1,850.57 represents an upside of 17.03% from the current levels as of April 3.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 54 hedge funds held stakes in First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) in Q4 of 2023, with positions worth $2.505 billion. As of December 31, 2023, Harris Associates is the largest shareholder of the company, with a position worth $710.716 million.\n\nArtisan Partners commented on First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) was our top overall contributor in 2023. Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, and one of the largest family-controlled banks in the US, First Citizens was a big winner from its acquisition of the failed Silicon Valley Bank. First Citizens purchased $72.1 billion in loans at a deeply discounted price of $16.5 billion. The transaction adds scale, increases geographic diversity and is financially attractive with downside protections from a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC. First Citizens is now one of the top-15 largest US banks. The bank is run by and almost fully controlled by CEO Frank Holding and his family members. They have significant ownership, aligning their interest with minority shareholders like us. They\u2019ve done an admirable job of growing the bank by keeping a strong capital and liquidity profile that allows for opportunistic M&A during times of market stress, like we just experienced in March. In the global financial crisis, First Citizens used its position of strength to acquire when others could not, and during the COVID-induced stress of 2020, it flexed its muscles again with the acquisition of CIT at a great price.\u201d\n\n6. AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER)\n\nPE Ratio as of April 3: 6.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\n\nAerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER) is headquartered in Ireland and is involved in leasing, financing, selling, and management of commercial flight equipment.

(NYSE:BRK-B), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR).\n\nO\u2019keefe Stevens Advisory stated the following regarding AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTop picks for 2024 \u2013 Five Point Holdings, LLC (FPH) (FPH) and AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER). Both situations are similar, with significant overhangs resolved in late 2023. Aercap acquired GECAS in 2021 for cash and stock. GE consistently sold their AER shares, creating heavy selling pressure. In addition, Aercaps planes on lease to Russian airlines were written off in 2022. Thus far, they received $1.2B in insurance recoverables, and ~$2B remains outstanding. Insurance proceeds provide substantial ammunition to aggressively repurchase shares. Ongoing engine and airplane production issues created a \u201chard market\u201d for secondary transactions. Aercap continually sells planes and engines for over 1.2x carrying value, using proceeds to repurchase stock at or below book value. Note- at a couple of turns of leverage, this ROE is closer to 70%-80%. Repurchasing stock trading at 90% of BV is almost a 100% delta between private market transactions and the stock. That is one hell of a trade! With airlines scrambling for capacity, Aercap holds substantial bargaining power, driving higher rates and longer terms.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the largest budget deficit as a percentage of GDP. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Largest Budget Deficit as a Percentage of GDP.\n\nA budget deficit occurs when the government's spending on public service, infrastructure, and other projects exceeds its revenue over a period, thus resulting in a negative balance of payment. While a budget deficit can bring positive effects on the economy in a short-term analysis by increasing aggregate demand, uplifting an economy from a recession, and increasing government spending. It is contagious in the long run for the economy's overall health and can lead to higher borrowing, higher interest payments, and low investment rates. Even some of the leading global economies, including the United States and China, are not immune to the challenge of having a budget deficit. According to the IMF, the Asia-Pacific region is on track to contribute two-thirds to global growth in 2024. However, a\u00a0majority of our countries with the largest budget deficit as a percentage of GDP belong to the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAsia Leading the Global Economic Growth\n\nAccording to the IMF, global economic growth has been surprisingly resilient, and inflation rates continue to fall steadily. The IMF now estimates a global growth of 3.1% in 2024, the same as the year before, and anticipates a gradual increase of 0.1% in 2025. Factors contributing to economic growth are two-pronged. On the one hand, strong government and private spending upholds the demand side. On the other hand, the high participation in the labor market, low energy prices, and ease of supply chain bottlenecks foster a smooth supply side.\n\nThe economic outlook of the Asia Pacific region reflects the global growth trends. The IMF has raised its growth projections for Asia and anticipates that the region's economy grew at 4.7% in 2023, showing a 0.1% increase from October 2023 estimates. Moving ahead, the growth for 2024 is projected to be 4.5% against the previous projection of 4.2% in October 2023. India and China are the major contributors to the upward revisions. While India continues to demonstrate a strong domestic demand, thereby fostering growth, China is working on its growth by increasing spending on disaster reconstruction and resilience projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the economic outlook has shown progress, multiple factors threaten its resilience. The foremost risk is China's property sector crises, which can further derail public demand, thereby affecting the regional trade balance. Furthermore, the prevailing risk of geopolitical fragmentation due to the less efficient supply chain and Asia's deep integration in global trade also threaten the regional economic outlook. However, on the bright side, a stronger-than-expected policy response from China coupled with the swift progress by the emerging Asian economies can boost demand and generate positive spillovers in the long run.

        "content": "U.S.-listed shares of China-based e-tailer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) are 0.8% lower at $72.80 at last glance, following news that the company bought back shares worth $4.8 billion -- its second largest repurchase ever. BABA is underperforming in 2024, down 6.1% year to date, and a historically bearish signal is flashing that could keep headwinds blowing.\n\nSpecifically, Alibaba stock just pulled back within one standard deviation of its 100-day moving average after mostly trading above the trendline since August. According to a study from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, eight other similar instances occurred in the last three years. After 75% of these occurrences, the equity suffered a drop one month later, averaging a 9.8% loss.\n\nA similar move from its current perch would put BABA near the $65.70 level, surpassing its year-to-date lows and moving to its lowest mark since November 2022. What's more, it would extend the stock's already steep 26% year-over-year deficit. BABA Chart 2 April 022024\n\nSentiment surrounding Alibaba stock is already quite bullish. Of the 15 covering analysts, 12 rate the shares a \"strong buy.\" Plus, short interest dropped 7.4% in the last reporting period.\n\nNow might be the perfect time to speculate on BABA's next move with options. The stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 29% sits in the low 8th percentile of its annual range. In other words, options players are pricing in lower-than-usual volatility expectations at the moment.",

Small-cap stocks are set to continue their record run as indices like the S&P 600 begin building momentum in light of rate cutting expectations and an improved economic outlook. Since nearly all companies, even the largest, started as small-caps, the sector tends to outperform larger indices in the long term.\n\nWe\u2019re in a particularly unique position, as a year\u2019s worth of higher rates means the worst or least viable companies are on their way out or didn\u2019t survive the financial realignment. Today\u2019s small-cap stocks, therefore, tend to be the strongest of the bunch, with management adept at navigating monetary policy changes and rapidly shifting economic conditions. These seven small-cap stocks stand out as some of the best of the bunch and could prove a solid foundation for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: PubMatic Inc (PUBM) The company sign is seen at the headquarters of PubMatic, an American digital advertising technology company for premium content creators.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital advertising is quickly becoming a perennial sector that tends to retain strength even amid poor economic conditions. While consumer spending may dip and eat into sales growth, the best digital advertising companies successfully navigate shifting conditions to stay afloat, if not thrive. PubMatic Inc (NASDAQ:PUBM) is among just a handful of small-cap digital advertising and media stocks that are successfully adapting to changing preferences \u2013 and thriving.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast year, record revenue figures for the small-cap advertising company hit $267 million in sales. Staying true to its small-cap growth stock designation, the company is plunging excess earnings into a comprehensive growth strategy to build on that momentum. Plans include improved customer acquisition strategies, revenue stream expansion, and increased machine learning emphasis to \u201c[build and scale] ROI and outcomes-based advertising solutions that rival the walled gardens,\u201d with walled gardens being a term describing the largest and impenetrable advertising heavyweights with closed ecosystems like Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAligned much more closely with the \u201cvalue\u201d side of the value/growth continuum than PubMatic, Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) is nevertheless a standout small-cap stock offering investors long-term upside potential alongside short-term stability. To the latter point, the company\u2019s gained nearly 50% over the past year and currently offers a 3.06% forward dividend yield \u2013 not bad for a company with less than $1.5 billion in market capitalization!\n\nBut investors looking for small-cap value stocks to buy shouldn\u2019t focus on dividends alone. Instead, look to Steelcase\u2019s steady revenue and rapidly increasing net income, which hit $777 million and $30.8 million in the most recent quarterly report. To that end, the company\u2019s fiscal year 2025 outlook is especially enticing as it capitalizes on a steadier economy and continued remote work trends. Management reported 10% higher sales in the first three weeks of the fiscal year alone and is targeting 1% \u2013 5% revenue growth and EPS between 85 cents and $1.00. Steelcase reported a year\u2019s end EPS of 68 cents, so the rosy executive outlook should be enough to spark interest in small-cap value investors.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: indie Semiconductor Inc (INDI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip.

As semiconductor demand remains high, but the biggest names tilt toward massive overvaluation, investors will increasingly turn to small-cap semiconductor stocks to find the \u201cnext big thing.\u201d Few small-cap semiconductor stocks are as robust as indie Semiconductor Inc (NASDAQ:INDI). The company\u2019s offerings focus primarily on automotive and self-driving car semiconductor applications, which are increasingly in demand as new car sales climb and drivers demand state-of-the-art luxuries like driver assistance and enjoyable infotainment displays.\n\nThe company\u2019s 2023 revenue was record-setting, climbing more than 100% to hit $223.2 million. Likewise, the company\u2019s profit margins are beyond reproach at 52.5% in 2023, more than 2.5% higher than the prior year.

This year saw increased scrutiny and even dismissal of legacy learning institutions, even the most elite, and I think artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging remote work and learning tech will be among the next massive social revolutions. Chegg is adapting AI to a range of learning applications, with its new AI-powered personalized learning assistant. The tool is built on the back of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and represents one of the few, if not only, broadly successful adaptations or applications of the tools within the EdTech sector.\n\nOf course, new and next-gen tools tend to be costly and unpredictable early in their lifecycle. To that end, Chegg shares dropped more than 30% since 2024 began, primarily on the heels of a less-than-desirable earnings report that included a more modest forecast than analysts expected. Still, Chegg\u2019s management acknowledged the rough patch as part of its R&D into AI EdTech applications, telling investors that its development is \u201congoing and iterative\u201d but that R&D costs mean it\u2019s also \u201ctoo early to predict when we will return to revenue and margin growth.\u201d Still, at its current price point and relatively low valuation, Chegg is a top small-cap stock to capitalize on EdTech\u2019s AI-enabled future.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: H&R Block (HRB) a man in a suit pulling a large bag of money with a rope. hot small-cap stocks for January 2024\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHave you filed your taxes yet? If not, you may be one of many Americans scrambling over the next two weeks, setting H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) for another solid earnings season. One of the primary concerns about companies like H&R Block is the inherent cyclical nature of their business \u2013 tax time comes every April, so customers tend to flock to the platform in January but fall off by mid-spring. However, H&R Block\u2019s recent initiatives to smooth its sales cycle are bearing fruit, as spin-off initiatives like its Spruce mobile banking platform set increasingly higher client acquisition and retention rates.\n\nH&R Block\u2019s last financial filing attributed more than $26 million in quarterly revenue to the banking platform. At roughly one-fourth of tax prep sales, that\u2019s still a solid stat \u2013 especially when considering $26 million represents customer deposits quadrupling. As rates stay steady or fall, H&R Block will be able to capitalize on increasing deposit rates more and ultimately see income from peripheral financial services surge.\n\nValley National Bancorp An image of a cellphone with a bank on top, surrounded by people and piles of money, a credit card and calculator. fintech stocks\n\nSource: fatmawati achmad zaenuri/Shutterstock\n\nI wrote about Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) last week, focusing on the company\u2019s potential strength as a cannabis stock. However, there\u2019s far more to this small-cap regional bank than its cannabis-centric initiatives. Trading at just 0.6x book value and 7.5x earnings, the small-cap financial stock is undervalued and, in many cases, under-appreciated. Valley\u2019s strong balance sheet and relatively low debt load (a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56, compared to the industry\u2019s 1.2 average) means that management is positioned to adapt to whatever economic conditions may come, as evidenced by its newest stock buyback plan and 5.71% trailing dividend yield.\n\nAnalysts broadly see Valley National as undervalued, with an average $9.50 price target that sits about 20% above today\u2019s per-share pricing. Likewise, they\u2019re increasingly bullish about the small-cap bank stock as 56% call the stock a \u201chold\u201d, compared to 50% calling for investors to sell during the previous polling period.\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (GCT) a photo of someone typing on a laptop on a wooden table with computer-related images\n\nSource: My Life Graphic/Shutterstock.com\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (NASDAQ:GCT) has been on a wild ride thus far in 2024, surging to nearly $45 per share after a solid earnings report before falling back down to pre-earnings levels where it sits today (slightly above $25 per share). But much of that decline seems to be investors merely taking profit rather than a substantial statement about GigaCloud\u2019s long-term potential. The company, whose closest analog is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) trades at just 11x earnings. Those looking at the stock with skepticism considering Alibaba\u2019s fall from grace should consider one major differentiator: GigaCloud services B2B markets and, more than just offering product sourcing, is an all-in-one vendor management platform to navigate cross-border payments and other tricky facets of global eCommerce that small businesses tend to struggle with.\n\nThe small-and-medium-sized business (SMB) market is largely unaddressed, and GigaCloud\u2019s solutions include payment processing, shipment and freight management, AI-enabled fulfillment, and even warehouse storage. This all-in-one package is a boon to SMBs struggling to compete with or work through larger players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As time goes on and companies like Amazon increasingly squeeze SMBs through fee and fulfillment rate hikes, those going it alone will increasingly turn to self-sourced/self-managed platforms like GigaCloud.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "(Reuters) -Alibaba Group has bought back shares worth $4.8 billion in the quarter ended March, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Tuesday, in its biggest-ever repurchase after beefing up its stock buyback plan in February.\n\nThe company had raised its share buyback plan by another $25 billion in a bid to appease investors concerned over its growth prospects as it faces new market rivals such as PDD.\n\nAlibaba, which is listed in both Hong Kong and the U.S., had bought back $2.9 billion worth of stock in the previous quarter.\n\nIts Hong Kong shares have lost more than 6% of their value this year, amid growing worries over the e-commerce pioneer's fall in earnings, per-user spending and deteriorating Chinese consumption.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese factors have contributed to the once-market dominant internet firm losing its market share to rivals such as PDD and TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nThe internet company in February reported net income to ordinary shareholders for the third quarter of 14.4 billion yuan($1.99 billion), a 77% slump, mainly due to impairments related to hypermarket operator Sun Art and online video streaming service Youku.\n\nAlibaba is currently in the middle of a split into six different units after the company named a new chief and abandoned a plan to list its cloud division and logistics arm, while refocusing on the core business.\n\n(Reporting by Aaditya Govind Rao in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",

Only one stock declined by more than a couple of percent\u2014Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), which was down 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year.

While it\u2019s true Alibaba is underperforming its peers in the market, the fact is it remains the market leader in its core businesses, and the business is still growing. In the most recent quarter, revenues grew 9% and profits grew 26%.It's not evaporating.\n\nThe management seems to be making meaningful changes designed to enhance shareholder value, including structural changes to improve profitability and restore its competitive position. It is monetizing non-core assets and making improvements in capital allocation. A lot of good things are happening that are not yet recognized in the share price.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned -3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 1.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.86 points to a change of +11.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.84 indicates a change of -0.3% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alibaba is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $31.19 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. The $131.88 billion and $141.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.6% and +7.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $36.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.46%. The EPS surprise was -2.2%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks to Exit Now Ahead of Any Chinese App Bans",
        "content": "Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to ban TikTok. Should this ban be ratified by the U.S. Senate, several U.S. companies and the stock market could react negatively. With the measure passing in a 352 to 65 vote, it\u2019s clear the US government sees a threat in TikTok. Though the bill needs to pass in the Senate, it could in theory result in ByteDance selling its TikTok division. Investors should watch out for stocks to exit ahead of Chinese app bans such as the proposed one.\n\nSuch a monumental shift in U.S. policy towards foreign companies could have widespread ramifications for\u00a0future Chinese listings on U.S. exchanges. This ban could also directly impact the marketing campaigns of several companies that rely on TikTok for exposure. Thus, it is imperative to prepare for the possibility that Chinese companies could become pawns in a new economic Cold War.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nWith the recent success of its subsidiary, Temu,\u00a0PDD Holdings, (NASDAQ:PDD) might actually benefit in the short term from the TikTok ban. The company has positioned itself as a low-cost competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the e-commerce space. Yet it also competes with TikTok Shop in offering cheap Chinese goods directly from manufacturers. However, Temu relies on expensive social media advertising to reach consumers as it grows its current position.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, general sentiment towards Chinese companies among U.S. retail investors may worsen.\u00a0Should the U.S. government signal a willingness to ban companies based on national security, investors may choose to divest rapidly. Thus, PDD\u2019s price stability could suffer in the wake of a TikTok ban.\n\nMoreover, Temu is a relatively new venture in the U.S. and is still working on building its business reputation. This has proven difficult for PDD, as many American consumers are put off by the low-quality offerings on Temu.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Why Alibaba Stock Makes Even More Sense to Buy Today. BABA\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nEssentially Amazon\u2019s direct counterpart in China,\u00a0Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) faces similar downsides should TikTok be banned in the U.S.. Much like the aforementioned Temu, Alibaba dominates the Chinese e-commerce market by offering inexpensive goods purchased directly from Chinese manufacturers. The company\u2019s international reach is mostly limited to Aliexpress and its few cloud computing services. Thus, it could significantly be weakened by a shift in U.S. government policy.\n\nThat\u2019s because AliExpress relies on capturing international markets, such as\u00a0Europe and South America. Some countries in these regions are hardline opposers of the Chinese Communist Party and may follow suit by banning TikTok. Much like the challenges facing PDD Holdings, Alibaba could struggle to maintain its reputation in Western markets. This could ultimately result in retail investors deciding that Chinese stocks are no longer worth the risk.\n\nEven more concerning is the fact that Alibaba\u2019s CEO, Jack Ma,\u00a0faced direct punishment from the Chinese government in 2020. Today, Alibaba\u2019s new CEO has been strictly in line with the Communist Party, unlike his astute predecessor.\n\nHelloFresh (HELFY) shutterstock_745923697-min\n\nSource: ThomasDeco / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the companies with the highest spending on TikTok advertising,\u00a0HelloFresh (OTCMKTS:HELFY) stands to lose exposure as a result of a TikTok ban. Known for its social media marketing, HelloFresh relies on short-form advertisements to spread awareness about its meal kit delivery services. Without TikTok, which reaches 170 million Americans a year, HelloFresh will have to advertise on more expensive apps.\n\nThis could significantly impact the company\u2019s advertisement spending and overall revenues from newly acquired customers. Moreover, HelloFresh\u2019s advertisements tend to perform well on TiTok due to the significant food culture present on the app. With so many viewers turning to TikTok for cooking and recipe videos, it is one of the most natural advertising outlets for HelloFresh.\n\nThis makes HelloFresh one of the stocks that will exit ahead of Chinese app bans, and it could see its stock price take a hit. However, should its share price drop, HelloFresh will recover because its business model does not need TikTok in the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here: 2 Spectacular Growth Stocks to Invest $1,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "The early months of 2024 have certainly brought a series of excellent market days for investors. With the S&P 500 setting multiple new records so far in 2024, many investors are feeling increasingly optimistic about putting cash into stocks compared to several months ago.\n\nWall Street has a habit of slipping into a bear market once every four years on average. But the good news: In every case, the market has not just recovered but also eventually reached new highs.\n\nBull markets tend to appear every five to six years on average, and they are usually much longer than bear markets. So if you invest in great companies, hold on to them, and keep investing during both the highs and lows, you can benefit from the best and worst days of the stock market.\n\nOn that note, if you have $1,000 to invest right now, here are two fantastic companies to consider.\n\n1. Innovative Industrial Properties\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties(NYSE: IIPR) is something of a unicorn in the world of marijuana stocks because it doesn't actually grow and sell pot. Instead, the company operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT).\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties acquires cultivation facilities, distribution centers, and other related real estate from state-licensed cannabis operators. It then rents these facilities back to the operators via long-term arrangements.\n\nThis model provides recurring rental income for Innovative Industrial Properties and offers more efficiency for the operators by letting them focus on the business of growing and selling marijuana.\n\nIt's important to note that the REIT only rents to operators in the medical cannabis business, which is more regulated and enjoys much broader legalization nationwide than the recreational use market. At the time of this writing, about 90% of Innovative Industrial Properties' portfolio was rented out to multi-state operators (MSOs), and around 60% of its tenants are publicly traded companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, the company reported revenue of $310 million and net income of $164 million. Those two figures rose 12% and 5%, respectively, from 2022. Adjusted funds from operations -- an important measure of REIT performance -- for the year totaled $257 million, up 10% from the prior year.\n\nAs of the end of the year, the REIT had 108 properties in 19 states. Currently, 95.8% of its operating portfolio is rented via triple net leases, where the tenant pays most of the costs associated with maintaining the property in addition to rent.\n\nAnother stellar figure is the rental collection rate, which stood at 100% as of February. The company also has a superior yield and track record of raising its dividend over time. Its current yield of 7% is considerably higher than the average stock trading on the S&P 500 (1.3%), and its dividend has risen 300% over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nThe cannabis market can be a risky place to put cash, at least until there is some measure of uniform legislation on a federal level. That said, the medical cannabis niche represents a vast and growing addressable market.\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties operates an unusual model within this industry that lends itself to steady, recurring returns for the business and its shareholders. Investors might want to consider getting a slice of the action.\n\n2. Alibaba\n\nAlibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA) has had a volatile few years. Management changes, regulatory headwinds, a difficult macroeconomic environment, and an overall deceleration in growth are just a few factors that have contributed to the stock's decline. At the time of this writing, shares are trading down by around 30% from one year ago, and about 60% from five years ago.\n\nAlibaba is the e-commerce leader in China, a country with the world's second largest economy behind the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund. China's e-commerce market is expected to reach a valuation of about $4 trillion by 2027.\n\nThe company accounts for about 50% of China's e-commerce market via a range of platforms including its namesake Alibaba, AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall. It even has a growing presence in groceries and fresh goods with its retail chain Freshippo.\n\nAlibaba also has a considerable presence in other lucrative markets including cloud infrastructure services, digital media, and entertainment. Alibaba Cloud controls about 40% of the country's cloud infrastructure market. The company planned to take its cloud segment public, but scrapped that idea late last year, which hurt its stock price.\n\nChina had some of the strictest COVID lockdowns in the world, so the gradual reopening of the economy has translated to a deceleration in growth for a market leader like Alibaba. There was also a $2.8 billion fine that Chinese regulators slapped Alibaba with a few years back in an antitrust case. In short, a range of factors have contributed to its struggles lately, some of which are outside the company's control.\n\nChina's economy is already having a robust recovery. Alibaba will benefit as these headwinds recede, and it's coming from a position of strength in market leadership and financials.\n\nOverall revenue grew 5% to $37 billion in the most recent quarter, and the company ended the period with cash and investments of about $92 billion. For risk-tolerant investors, the huge growth opportunity remaining for Alibaba in multiple rapidly expanding markets might warrant a second look given its current discounted valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Innovative Industrial Properties right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Innovative Industrial Properties, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Innovative Industrial Properties wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Syngenta Group withdrew its long-delayed application for a $9 billion initial public offering in Shanghai, another blow to China\u2019s equity markets after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. this week scrapped the listing of its logistics arm.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla\u2019s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly Line Bankman-Fried Is Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison Over FTX Collapse Apple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up Overseas UBS Banker\u2019s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate Finance Fed\u2019s Preferred Inflation Metric Cools While Spending Rebounds\n\nThe Chinese-owned seed and pesticide giant \u201cwill look to restart the listing process, either in China or a different global exchange, when the conditions are right,\u201d Syngenta said Friday in a statement on its website. \u201cIt will also explore alternate sources of funding.\u201d\n\nThe announcement, which confirmed a report by Bloomberg News, is further evidence of the headwinds confronting Chinese equities, with the economy weighed down by a long-running real estate crisis, deflationary pressure and geopolitical tensions. The benchmark CSI 300 Index touched a five-year low in early February and is down 39% from its 2021 peak, even as US and European stocks touch record highs.\n\nE-commerce pioneer Alibaba on Tuesday called off an initial public offering for its Cainiao logistics arm in Hong Kong, the second time it\u2019s halted a high-profile debut for one of its businesses. Equity capital markets elsewhere, meanwhile, are finally picking up after a two-year drought, with social-media company Reddit Inc. listing in the US this month and skin-care company Galderma Group AG going public in Switzerland.\n\nSyngenta first filed for an IPO in China\u2019s financial hub in 2021, but its listing has been snagged by various issues. The most recent delay came in November, when the company said it would postpone the offering until the end of 2024 because of volatile markets. That float would have raised 65 billion yuan ($9 billion). It also said it would explore alternative options for expanding its shareholder base.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, the Swiss company says it\u2019s withdrawing the listing \u201cafter careful consideration of industry environment and the company\u2019s own development strategy.\u201d\n\nAlso Friday, Syngenta reported results for the fourth quarter. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization climbed 15% to $1 billion, while sales advanced 5% to $7.9 billion, driven by crop protection and its business in China.\n\nSyngenta was bought by China National Chemical Corp., or ChemChina, in 2017 for $43 billion, a record-breaking overseas acquisition for the country, and one that spoke to Beijing\u2019s growing concerns around food security. Syngenta\u2019s products, including genetically modified seeds, are important building blocks for improving the quality and quantity of China\u2019s agricultural production.\n\nChemChina has since been absorbed into Sinochem Holdings Corp.\n\n(Updates with Syngenta earnings in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFTX\u2019s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto The Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet\u2019s Favorite Wok How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving Building Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFed\u2019s Preferred Inflation Metric Cools While Spending Rebounds Tesla\u2019s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly Line Powell Reiterates Fed Doesn\u2019t Need to Be In Hurry to Cut Rates Bank of Russia Sees No Alternative to Yuan for Its Reserves Apple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up Overseas\n\nThe Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That\u2019s more than 65% higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.\n\nThe results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone lineup with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3% in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.\n\nHuawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China\u2019s determination to thwart Washington\u2019s curbs. It\u2019s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22% during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company\u2019s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Huawei hasn\u2019t gone as far as Xiaomi Corp., which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company\u2019s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128% in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.\n\nHuawei\u2019s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of homegrown devices and technology across different industries and sectors \u2014 including state enterprises.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 most undervalued retail stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the retail industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Retail Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAccording to Economic Intelligence\u2019s consumer goods and retail outlook 2024 report, in 2024, global retail sales are projected to grow by 6.7%, with a 2% increase in volume due to a slowdown in inflation. Despite this growth, some challenges remain due to depleted household savings and high food prices, especially in developing economies. Additionally, the report states that online sales are expected to see double-digit growth in 2024, reaching 14.6% of total global retail sales. However, online retailers will continue to face challenges in maintaining profitability due to some regulatory issues.\n\nThe online retail industry experienced significant declines after its February 2021 highs. While the industry is still a long way from complete recovery, it still showed decent performance over the last 12 months. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY) is still 58.5% lower than its February 12, 2021 levels but has gained 38.21% in the last 12 months, compared to 27.20% gains of SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) and S&P 500\u2019s 30.82% gains, as of March 26 market close.\n\nFuture of Retail According to Retail Executives\n\nOn February 16, CNBC shared the predictions of top retail executives that included Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\u2019s (NYSE:ANF) CEO, Fran Horowitz, Levi Strauss & Co.\u2019s (NYSE:LEVI) CEO, Michelle Gass, chief e-commerce officer of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and a few others.\n\nThe executives mentioned that the retail landscape is shifting towards smaller, omnichannel stores that are strategically located to align with what customers want and need. The retail spaces will be set up to run smoothly and will guarantee a hassle-free shopping experience. Additionally, traditional brick-and-mortar stores are transforming into engaging places that offer immersive experiences and much more than the typical shopping trip to captivate customers' senses. Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\u2019s (NYSE:ANF) CEO, Fran Horowitz said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe future of retail is small, efficient, omni stores, and they\u2019re located where the customer tells us. [For Abercrombie] these big, massive stores were just not productive and not efficient \u2014 the consumer was responding to a much more intimate associate experience, and then economically, they were not productive. You don\u2019t get the kind of traffic through the stores like you did in the past when there wasn\u2019t a digital option, so you have to provide a location that is financially sound, which has X amount of traffic and X amount of digital orders that come together.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the executives emphasized the role of AI in the future of retail. They said that AI will reshape retail through personalized experiences owing to data analysis. Advanced algorithms will deliver tailored recommendations and promotions and that will improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, AI will help with the seamless integration of online and offline channels, which will make transitions for shoppers much easier. This can enhance convenience and flexibility and encourage customers to engage with retailers across various platforms. As CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI), Michelle Gass said:\n\n\u201cIf you think about the technology today, broadly speaking, a lot of what you might see in the personalization is, okay, if you\u2019re an avid buyer of [Levi\u2019s] 501s [jeans], you might get a recommendation on the next exciting wash of a 501, or something similar. But I think where the technology is going to go is it\u2019s going to be able to leap into something like, to go from you\u2019re a 501 shopper to this is going to be the perfect denim skirt for you and make bolder leaps, but do it in a way that\u2019s informed based on your shopping history and who you are.\u201d\n\nThe executives also stated that sustainability and inclusivity are some of the top priorities in retail, with a focus on inclusive sizing and sustainable practices like using eco-friendly materials and ethical sourcing. Sam\u2019s Club CEO Chris Nicholas mentioned that renewable energy and electric vehicles are going to become vastly important in the future of retail. On December 13, Walmart Canada announced putting Canada\u2019s first electric semi-trucks on the road. According to the company, each of the trucks will travel around 68,000 miles annually. On top of that, these trucks will save around 100,000 liters of fuel annually.\n\nRecent Updates on Major Retail Companies\n\nOne of the best discount retailer stocks and the largest retailer in the world, Walmart Inc.

And while we do this, we can grow in a way that helps us achieve our goals of creating opportunities for our associates and becoming a more sustainable business. In 2017, we announced a bold ambition to work with our suppliers to reduce, avoid, or sequester one gigaton, that's 1 billion metric tons, of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We call it Project Gigaton. Our merchants and suppliers got to work and made investments in practical things like energy efficiency, packaging, redesign, and load optimization.

Here are some comments from Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers.\"\n\nWith that in mind, some of the most undervalued retail stocks to buy now are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Lowe's Companies, Inc.

(NYSE:KR) is a food and drug retailer and runs retail stores under various brands, including Kroger, Ralphs, Dillons Marketplace, Food 4 Less, and more. As of March 26, the company has a market capitalization of $40.601 billion.\n\nAs of March 26, the stock has a PE ratio of 19.08. According to our database, The Kroger Co.

Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) (U.S.) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger\u2019s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger\u2019s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year\u2019s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger\u2019s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons could accelerate the company\u2019s earnings growth and produce additional scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.\u201d\n\n9. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)\n\nPE as of March 26: 17.54\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nDollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the most famous discount retailers in the US and offers a wide range of products, including but not limited to consumables, seasonal items, home products, etc. The company sells its products under various brands, namely Dollar General, Clover Valley, Smart & Simple, and more.

As of March 26, the stock has a PE ratio of 17.54.\n\nHedge fund sentiment was positive toward Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in Q4 of 2023. In the quarter, hedge funds with investments in the stock were 47, with positions worth $1.25 billion. This is compared to 38 funds with positions worth $1.13 billion in the third quarter. Holocene Advisors is the top investor in the company and has a position worth $257.206 million as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nArtisan Partners stated the following regarding Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur biggest full-year detractors included energy holdings Schlumberger and EOG and 2023 purchases Baxter International and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG). Dollar General, a discount retail chain in the US, has dealt with a few struggles. The retailer had previously benefited from COVID stimulus checks, reflected in the bump it experienced in revenues and margins. However, the effects have worn off, and its core consumer has been hurt by inflation, stiffer economic conditions, lower tax refunds and reduced SNAP benefits. Margins are also under pressure due to labor costs, shrink and markdowns. Some of the issues are likely self-inflicted. After years of focusing on store growth to drive the top line, store standards have suffered. Addressing store standards is needed to turn around flagging traffic, comps and customer satisfaction. On the positive side, discount retail due to its trade-down feature tends to be a defensive business during economic slowdowns. Dollar General has a strong market position and faces less competition than other discounters due to its largely rural footprint. The business\u2019s value proposition is everyday low prices, a convenient format and proximity. The company has leverage due to capital expenditures, but interest coverage of ~9X is strong. From a valuation perspective, the froth from the pandemic, when it traded in the low- to mid-twenties, is gone. So, we aren\u2019t paying for margin upside or store growth. Those would be bonuses. If the company can continue to grow revenues, generate cash flow and buy back stock, we still see a path to success.\u201d\n\n8. Bath & Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI)\n\nPE as of March 26: 12.53\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nBath & Body Works, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ULTA) was mentioned in Carillon Tower Advisers\u2019 Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\u201cUlta Beauty operates a chain of beauty stores.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\nNow, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.\n\nSo naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.\n\nNVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:\n\nYes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.\n\nJensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.\n\nSo, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Alibaba (BABA): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alibaba (BABA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy, representing 81.3% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Alibaba, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in BABA?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.86.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alibaba.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia May Be in a Bubble, but These 3 AI Stocks Have Never Been Cheaper",
        "content": "Wall Street is a stomping ground for innovation. Since the advent of the internet three decades ago, there have been a long list of next-big-thing trends and innovations that have come down the line, including genome decoding, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, just to name a few. However, none of these trends offers the game-changing potential that artificial intelligence (AI) has brought to the table.\n\nWith AI, businesses are using software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. Machine learning gives these systems and software the ability to evolve over time and become more effective at their tasks, as well as potentially learn new tasks. The broad-ranging utility of AI is what compelled the researchers at PwC to estimate that it could add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia stock has soared, thanks to AI, but may be in a bubble\n\nThough there are dozens of publicly traded companies set to benefit from the AI revolution, none have enjoyed a more direct boost than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. With Nvidia meaningfully increasing production of its core AI-GPUs, it's unlikely the company will cede much in the way of data center market share -- at least in the first-half of the year.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), Nvidia's data center sales more than tripled to $47.5 billion. While innovation did the talking, Nvidia's biggest \"weapon\" has been its pricing power. Enterprise demand for high-powered GPUs has swamped supply, which has allowed Nvidia to rapidly increase the selling price of its units.\n\nUnfortunately, this fairy tale story for Nvidia may come to an end sooner than later if history has anything to say about it.\n\nOver the past 30 years, there hasn't been a single next-big-thing trend that didn't involve an early stage bubble. History has shown that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption/uptake of a new technology, trend, or innovation. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there's more to be concerned about than just historic correlations. There's the real potential for Nvidia to cannibalize its own gross margin as it expands production of its prized GPUs and newly introduced Blackwell chip. GPU scarcity was the core driver of data center sales growth in fiscal 2024. As external competitors enter the space and Nvidia ups its own output, this scarcity will dwindle and, more than likely, erode some of its gross margin.\n\nWorse yet, Nvidia's four largest customers by sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own. These \"Magnificent Seven\" components are either going to lessen their reliance on Nvidia in future years or entirely replace its infrastructure in in-house data centers.\n\nAll of these factors suggest that Nvidia's stock may be in a bubble.\n\nForget Nvidia: These AI stocks have never been cheaper\n\nBut this doesn't mean all artificial intelligence stocks are in a bubble or at risk of a collapse if history rhymes, once more. Three AI stocks, which have never been cheaper on the basis of forward-year earnings and share a common trait, appear to be much smarter buys for investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlibaba\n\nThe first AI stock that looks like a phenomenal value when placed side-by-side with the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, Nvidia, is none other than China's leading e-commerce platform Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nMost investors are familiar with Alibaba because it's an online retail juggernaut in the world's No. 2 economy by GDP. Estimates from the International Trade Association in 2023 pegged Taobao and Tmall as controlling close to 51% of China's e-commerce market share, on a combined basis. The country's burgeoning middle class suggests e-commerce can provide superior growth rates for years to come.\n\nBut what investors might not know about Alibaba is that its cloud infrastructure service platform, Alibaba Cloud, accounted for more than a third of China's cloud infrastructure service spend during the first quarter of 2023. Alibaba Cloud is leaning on generative AI solutions to assist businesses in building applications that can improve customer interactions. Enterprise cloud spending in China is still in its very early innings.\n\nDespite being the undisputed e-commerce and cloud infrastructure service leader in China, Alibaba's valuation has never been this cheap. Backing out the roughly $92 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments Alibaba closed out 2023 with, shares of the company are trading at less than 5 times consensus forward-year earnings. Even factoring in the regulatory risk factors that come with putting your money to work in China, Alibaba looks like a screaming bargain.\n\nJD.com\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that's historically cheap and would make for a smarter buy than Nvidia is China's No. 2 e-commerce player, JD.com(NASDAQ: JD). That's right, a second China stock!\n\nAs I pointed out with Alibaba, online retail sales in China are still early in their ramp phase, which is fantastic news for the entire industry. But JD.com holds an advantage that might make it an even more attractive buy than Alibaba. Whereas China's leading e-commerce company relies heavily on third-party sellers, JD is predominantly a direct-to-consumer (DTC) retailer. Like Amazon, it controls the inventory and logistics required to get purchased products to consumers. Having more control over the DTC process should lead to superior margins over the long run.\n\nWhile JD.com isn't anywhere near close to the same level as Alibaba when it comes to AI dominance, it did debut large language model ChatRhino last year. The goal for JD with ChatRhino is to help businesses shorten innovation timelines and quickly resolve supply chain issues across a variety of industries. ChatRhino was in development two years prior to its launch and has the potential to lift JD's growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, JD was sitting on a treasure chest of $22.7 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and various investments. JD is valued at less than 8 times forward earnings, and more than half of its market cap is derived from its net cash balance. All risk appears to be baked into JD's stock at its current valuation.\n\nBaidu\n\nThe third AI company that's never been cheaper at a time when Nvidia stock appears to be in a bubble is China's leading internet search engine Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU). In case you haven't noticed, the trait these stocks all share is that they're based in the world's No. 2 economy (China).\n\nBaidu's foundational segment has long been its internet search engine. Although Alphabet's internet search engine Google dominates globally, Baidu is the kingpin within China. It held a 60% share of internet search in China in February, and has, with few exceptions, sustained a 60% to 85% share of domestic internet search dating back nine years. If businesses want to target Chinese consumers with their message(s), there's a high probability they're going to use Baidu.\n\nMore importantly, Baidu is also a key player in China's rapidly growing cloud infrastructure service arena. During the March-ended quarter in 2023, Baidu's AI Cloud had grabbed an 8% share of spending, which ranked fourth in the country behind Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Tencent Cloud.\n\nFurther, Baidu is the worldwide leader in intelligent driving. Subsidiary Apollo Go has completed more than 5 million autonomous rides on public roads since its inception.\n\nRounding things out, Baidu stock is dirt cheap. Shares can be purchased right now for about 8 times forward-year earnings. But this doesn't factor in the company's more than $28 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and various investments. The risk-versus-reward profile overwhelmingly favors upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- One of Hong Kong\u2019s last big hopes for a resurgence of its IPO market has been dashed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s move to scrap a listing of its logistics unit, piling pressure on the financial hub\u2019s leaders to find new paths to a revival.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump\u2019s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World\u2019s 500 Richest People Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Trump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Vital Baltimore Bridge Collapses After Being Struck by Ship After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce giant on Tuesday called off a $1 billion-plus sale of new shares in Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Ltd., citing poor market conditions. Samsonite International SA and L\u2019Occitane International SA have also been weighing an exit from the city\u2019s bourse due to low valuations.\n\nHong Kong needs \u201cfundamental changes\u201d to how it\u2019s perceived, said Andy Wong, IPO leader at advisory firm SW Hong Kong. \u201cThe drain of international capital in Hong Kong also significantly increases the difficulties of an IPO success.\u201d\n\nAlibaba\u2019s latest decision, adding to an earlier reported call to delay an IPO for its grocery chain unit, is another reminder of the challenges facing the Asian financial center. Fundraising via initial public share sales in Hong Kong has dropped for four consecutive years, as its equity markets suffer from Beijing\u2019s regulatory crackdown on private enterprises, a slowing Chinese economy and tensions with the US.\n\nIPO proceeds are down 39% so far this quarter to about $508 million, poised for the worst three-month period since the global financial crisis, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The city hasn\u2019t hosted a new share offering bigger than $1 billion since CALB Group Co.\u2019s debut in October 2022, pushing its total market capitalization down by about 38% from a peak in 2021.\n\n\u201cMarkets are pretty depressed, there\u2019s also a lack of liquidity,\u201d Alibaba\u2019s Chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts during a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cFor us, it doesn\u2019t make sense to continue to grind into these capital markets deals if it doesn\u2019t unlock value for shareholders.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe benchmark Hang Seng Index is down almost 50% from its 2021 peak, even after a recent rebound. As deals plunge and Chinese stocks lose their place in global portfolios, bankers are getting laid off. One who was made redundant by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the drop in IPOs flowing from China means banks will have to consider more restructuring.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong\u2019s Formerly High-Flying Bankers Become Lost Generation\n\nLocal authorities have stepped up efforts to restore market confidence in recent years, including slashing trading costs and wooing investors from the Middle East via official visits. Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive John Lee in 2022 set a target to persuade more than 200 family offices with HK$240 million ($31 million) in assets to establish or expand their operations by the end of 2025.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s decision to cancel Cainiao\u2019s IPO \u201crisks other Chinese companies scrapping listing plans in Hong Kong,\u201d said Sharnie Wong, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. The city\u2019s bourse is facing earnings pressure and its new Chief Executive Officer Bonnie Chan is expected to outline a new strategy in the coming months, Wong said.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leaders face an uphill battle to revive investor confidence as the Chinese economy continues to struggle with a housing crisis and waning domestic consumption. The passing of a new security law earlier this month, which prompted fresh warnings from the US, European Union and UK, rekindled concerns about the appeal of the city as a global finance center.\n\nThe Hong Kong stock exchange has seen only 10 companies listed this year, with the average IPO size at $51 million. With Cainiao out of the picture, authorities are pining hopes on other mid-to-large size deals in the pipeline, including those from smartphone maker DreamSmart Group and Horizon Robotics, a Chinese provider of autonomous driving computing solutions.\n\nFast-fashion company Shein may be another candidate, as the company mulls switching its IPO away from New York due to US regulatory hurdles, with some touting Hong Kong as a better listing venue.\n\nThe current key drags for Hong Kong\u2019s markets are \u201cthe lack of changes in China\u2019s economy and the global risk appetite for China-related assets,\u201d said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis SA. \u201cIf a firm is not desperate, it will probably wait or find other financing means rather than equity offerings.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Sarah Zheng and Pei Li.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley Hong Kong\u2019s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China In This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn\u2019t Classified Tesla\u2019s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue Jokes, Pop Music and Radical Honesty: How TikTok Is Changing Home Sales\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Alibaba Group Holding on Tuesday said it had scrapped plans to list its logistics unit Cainiao in Hong Kong, as it looks to prioritize growing its e-commerce business while facing challenging IPO market conditions.\n\nAlibaba said Tuesday that it was withdrawing its initial public offering and listing application, and instead proposes purchasing all outstanding shares of Cainiao Smart Logistics Network.\n\nThe repurchase offer will value Cainiao at $10.3 billion. Alibaba currently holds a stake of 64% in the logistics unit, and the buyout offer will allow minority shareholders to sell their shares to Alibaba.\n\n\u201cGiven the strategic importance of Cainiao to Alibaba and the significant long-term opportunity we see in building out a global logistics network, we believe this is an appropriate time to double down on Alibaba\u2019s investment in Cainiao,\u201d said Joe Tsai, chairman of Alibaba Group.\n\nThe company also said that current market conditions would \u201cunlikely garner a valuation\u201d that reflects Cainiao\u2019s strategic value to Alibaba\u2019s business.\n\nThe scrapped IPO comes as Alibaba has set its focus on growing its cloud computing and e-commerce businesses. Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce business has come under pressure from rivals such as PDD\u2019s Pinduoduo and ByteDance\u2019s Douyin, which often offer products at lower prices.\n\nCainiao handles much of Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce logistics, and operates a global logistics network that faciliates cross-border e-commerce.\n\nAlibaba restructured its businesses last March, splitting them into six units that would eventually raise their own capital and go public.\n\nIts cloud unit had been expected to be among the first to hold an initial public offering, but Alibaba later scrapped plans to spin-off the business, citing uncertainties over U.S. export curbs on advanced chips used for artificial intelligence.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is calling off an initial public offering for its Cainiao logistics arm in Hong Kong, shelving a much-anticipated debut that could have raised more than $1 billion.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Trump\u2019s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World\u2019s 500 Richest People After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction US CEOs Extend China Stay on Last-Minute Invite to Meet Xi Mahathir Sons Say 98-Year-Old Father Focus of Malaysia Probe\n\nChina\u2019s e-commerce pioneer, which owns 64% of Cainiao, said in a Tuesday filing it now plans to buy out all remaining stock held by investors and employees for $3.75 billion. The company decided to postpone the transaction because of poor market conditions, people familiar with the matter said. It lost its taste for the deal this year as stocks waned, the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing a private matter. Still, Alibaba could choose to revive the IPO should markets recover, they added.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time Alibaba has nixed a high-profile coming-out party for one of its main businesses. In 2023, the Chinese internet firm stunned the market when it called off a listing of its $11 billion cloud unit. Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Ltd., which handles a major chunk of the millions of parcels that Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce business generates daily, was considered one of its fastest-growing enterprises.\n\nLast year, Alibaba also put plans to debut its Freshippo grocery chain on the backburner. Its retreat coincides with growing uncertainty in public markets as Beijing grapples with a property crisis, loss of foreign investor confidence and the resultant economic downturn. At the same time, domestically oriented businesses are struggling to grow their topline because of waning consumer confidence.\n\n\u201cGiven the strategic importance of Cainiao to Alibaba and the significant long-term opportunity we see in building out a global logistics network, we believe this is an appropriate time to double down on Alibaba\u2019s investment in Cainiao,\u201d Alibaba Chairman Joseph Tsai said in a blogpost Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba is still grappling with fundamental questions surrounding the once-dominant internet company \u2014 a barometer of Chinese demand. Its performance underscored a loss of market share to rivals such as PDD and ByteDance Ltd. It posted a lower-than-projected 5% rise in December quarter revenue to 260.3 billion yuan ($36.2 billion), well off the pace of previous years.\n\nFueling the uncertainty, the company is going through a complicated multi-way split intended to create several independent businesses and rejuvenate the national icon. The company last year outlined plans to float its Freshippo grocery chain and Cainiao logistics arm. But Tsai last month appeared to soften its stance on those plans, saying Alibaba was in no hurry to float Cainiao because challenging market conditions would prevent it from reaping fair value.\n\nCainiao, which filed for its IPO about six months ago in September, was valued at about $10.3 billion in the minority shareholder buyout.\n\nAlibaba \u2014 which after years of frenetic investment now controls a vast portfolio of assets \u2014 is now actively looking to sell off some of those non-core holdings, he added. It\u2019s exploring ways to offload the InTime department store chain and other retail operations, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nRead More: Alibaba Said to Weigh Sale of Mall Chain in Latest Overhaul Step\n\n--With assistance from Sarah Zheng and Fion Li.\n\n(Updates with Tsai\u2019s comments from the second paragraph.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 poorest countries in Asia by GDP per capita. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Poorest Countries in Asia by GDP Per Capita.\n\nAsia's Economic Outlook\n\nThe aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Asia-Pacific region battling with disrupted economic growth. However, Asia is one of the few regions expected to perform better than the rest of the world. The Asian economy is facing a mix of both economic instability and economic growth. Two of the region's largest economies including China and India are going in opposite directions, with China suffering from a property market crisis and deflation while India making notable progress.\n\nAccording to the IMF, growth in Asia was estimated to be around 4.7% in 2023, up 0.1% from the previous 4.6% projection in October 2023. China and India are the key economies for the upward revision. In China, increased spending on disaster reconstruction and resilience projects supported growth. In India, growth was supported by strong domestic demand. The IMF has upgraded Asia's growth forecast for 2024 from the previous projection of 4.2% in October 2023 to 4.5%. In emerging and developing Asia, the growth is expected to decline from 5.4% in 2023 to 5.2% in 2024 and 4.8% in 2025. The growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is forecasted to increase from 2% in 2023 to 2.9% in 2024 and 4.2% in 2025.\n\nAlthough the IMF has upgraded the growth estimates, China\u2019s property sector could further cut domestic demand, especially if the stress level rises in local government finances. It would potentially impact regional exports, reducing demand for exports. In addition, China has had an inflation rate of around 0.3% in 2023 with the economy heading towards deflation. Other potential risks such as tighter-than-expected conditions in Asia and the US could impact heavily indebted industries and economies. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East can impact global trade as Yemeni Houthis are continuously attacking the ships of Israel and its allies. As we mentioned in our article about the 20 countries with the highest tariffs, the traffic through the Red Sea has declined by over 40% since the attacks from Houthis, disrupting global supply chains. On average nearly 50 ships pass through the Red Sea each day, comprising $3 billion to $9 billion worth of cargo.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), the Asia-Pacific region is expected to continue rapid economic expansion followed by resilient domestic demand in China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. In addition, strong foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in India and other South Asian countries will positively impact the economic growth in the region. On January 17, Reuters reported that India has attracted FDI inflows worth $33 billion in the first six months of the current financial year that started in April 2023. India recorded an FDI of $71 billion in the 2022-23 financial year.\n\nMost of the poorest countries in the world are based out of sub-Saharan Africa having the lowest GDP per capita. Along with African countries, some Asian countries also have the lowest GDP per capita in the world, including Afghanistan, Syria, and Sri Lanka.\n\nMajor Companies that are Driving Asia's Growth\n\nJD.com Inc (NASDAQ:JD), Reliance Industries Limited (NSE: RELIANCE), and SM Investments Corporation (PSE:SM) are some of the leading companies that play an important role in their respective economies and across the Asia Pacific.\n\nJD.com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the top e-commerce firms based out of China and one of the biggest competitors of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). On March 6, JD.com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) reported its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $0.74, beating consensus estimates by $0.11. The revenue for the quarter amounted to $42.52 billion, surpassing estimates by $914.80 million. Here are some of the comments from the company\u2019s earnings call:\n\n\u201cIn Q4, we delivered healthy top-line and bottom-line growth and made solid progress on operations, finishing off a productive 2023. In the past year, we stayed focused on constantly improving user experience, lowering costs, and increasing efficiency amidst evolving opportunities and challenges. Guided by our business philosophy, we carried out a set of proactive moves to drive more sustainable growth for the long term, mainly in the areas of user experience improvement, [indiscernible], and platform ecosystem strategy. Despite some short-term impact in 2023, our strategic focus has successfully steered key operating metrics in a positive direction.\n\n2024 will be a year of execution. Our team will take firm and steady steps to execute our existing strategies and push forward our two priorities for the new year, namely user experience improvement and market share expansion.\u201d\n\nReliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE) is India\u2019s leading multinational giant. On February 28, Reliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE) announced that its subsidiary, Reliance Consumer Products Limited (RCPL), has partnered with Sri Lankan beverage company Elephant House. This new collaboration will allow Elephant House to manufacture, distribute, and sell beverages in India and help RCPL enhance its beverage portfolio.\n\nSM Investments Corporation (PSE:SM) is a Filipino conglomerate that has a diversified portfolio in shopping mall development, retail, banking, real estate development, and tourism. On February 28, SM Investments Corporation (PSE:SM) reported that its consolidated revenues soared by 11% to PHP 616.3 billion in 2023 from PHP 553.0 billion in 2022. The net income was reported around PHP 77 billion in 2023, which grew 25% from PHP 61.7 billion in 2022. SM Investments Corporation (PSE:SM) sees potential for regional development and targeted high-growth sectors. Here is what the President and CEO of the company, Frederic C. DyBuncio, said:\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of potential, especially in Luzon outside of the National Capital Region (NCR) as well as in Visayas and Mindanao where there is still a need to access modern trade. And it\u2019s not just for our core businesses of retail, banking, and property but also for our portfolio companies.\u201d\n\nWith this context, let\u2019s take a look at the 25 poorest countries in Asia by GDP per capita.  25 Poorest Countries in Asia by GDP per Capita\n\n25 Poorest Countries in Asia by GDP per Capita\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the poorest countries in Asia by GDP per capita, we have shortlisted the countries based on GDP per capita (current prices) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) database. We have ranked the countries in descending order of their GDP per capita, as of 2024. The data for some countries was not available on the IMF, therefore, we sourced the GDP per capita for those countries from the World Bank database, which includes Afghanistan, Syria, and Sri Lanka. We have also highlighted the GDP (current prices) of the countries, wherever available, and the data is taken from the IMF database, as of 2024.\n\n25 Poorest Countries in Asia by GDP per Capita\n\n25.

Iran has a GDP of $386.22 billion and ranks 25th among the poorest countries in Asia by GDP per capita.\n\n24. Turkmenistan\n\nGDP Per Capita (2024): $20,551\n\nTurkmenistan\u2019s economy is expected to grow 6% in 2024, as per the Asian Development Bank.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best China ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the Chinese economy, check out Navigating China's Economy: 5 Best China ETFs.\n\nChina\u2019s position in the global economy is undeniably strong. It is responsible for approximately 10% of world stock market capitalization and trade, around 18% of world GDP, about 16% of global oil demand, and more than one fourth of global money. Oxford Economicsobserved that while China in 2024 has relatively relaxed policies, the private sector confidence is hindered by concerns relating to the property market. While the Chinese government is implementing policy measures that might negate downside risk, these might not be sufficient to reverse the economic slowdown. There is a chance that authorities might opt to stimulate the economy to achieve a higher growth target in 2024.\n\nMajor investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, forecast a slower growth rate for China\u2019s economy in 2024 compared to last year. The average prediction of five international banks is a 4.6% rise in real GDP in 2024, compared to the 5.2% growth expectation in 2023. JPMorgan\u2019s Chief China Economist and Head of Greater China Economic Research Haibin Zhu commented in January 2024:\n\n\u201cAn important task in 2024 is to manage the downside risk in the economy, particularly from the housing market correction and its spillover risks. Deflation pressure will likely fade in 2024, with the turnaround in global commodity prices and domestic pork prices, but low inflation will stay along with insufficient domestic demand.\u201d\n\nIn the past, China\u2019s economy was often experiencing double-digit growth, but the COVID pandemic and the real estate crisis has created a slump. In 2023, China reported growth in tourism and electronic vehicle sectors, but the economy failed to rebound, contrary to market expectations. In 2024, analysts expect significant easing of macroeconomic policies, especially by the central government, to assist the economy and impede a sharp decline in real GDP growth. TheInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) also amended its China growth forecast last year due to favorable policy announcement, but expects a slowdown to 4.6% in 2024, driven by inadequacies in the property sector and limited external demand. Premier Li said that China stayed away from comprehensive stimulus packages to avoid long-term risks. Analysts predict a further slowdown in China\u2019s economy, with UBS estimating annual GDP growth rate to fall roughly to 3.5% after 2025, in part due to the housing slump hindering stimulus measures. However, the growth opportunities in China, especially in urbanization, manufacturing, services, and renewable energy, must be recognized. While China\u2019s growth rate is forecasted to slow, it remains faster than many developed economies, with the IMF forecasting a slowdown in US real GDP growth from 2.1% in 2023 to 1.5% in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo provide insight into China's economic trajectory, JP Morganexamined key areas of interest in the Chinese economy and equity markets. First of all, the housing market is a significant indicator of market confidence. Despite experiencing its third year of slowdown, organic demand shows no signs of bottoming out, with price expectations turning bearish. In 2024, house sales in the early weeks were notably lower compared to last year, which emphasizes present challenges. Despite multiple programs set in place to aid the property market, their effectiveness and impact remains uncertain. Secondly, exports face cyclical challenges resulting from expectations of sluggish growth in developed markets and apprehensions about overcapacity. While export prices have become stable, there are increasing concerns about tensions in trade and resistance against China's dominance in some industries. Thirdly, increased regulations have dampened the business sentiment, resulting in a striking slowdown in private sector investment. 2024 is expected to be another challenging year for China's economy. The effectiveness of stimulus measures remains uncertain, and JP Morgan advises investors to remain vigilant amid ongoing uncertainties in the market.\n\nChina has set a growth target of \"around 5%\" for 2024 and announced the issuance of \"ultra-long\" special bonds for major projects. Premier Li Qiang, in delivering the government work report in March 2024, also pledged to remove restrictions for foreign investment in manufacturing. The deficit-to-GDP ratio for the year was set at 3%, down from a rare upward revision to 3.8% late last year. The report stated that Beijing will issue 1 trillion yuan or $138.9 billion in \"ultra-long\" special treasury bonds in 2024 to finance major projects aligned with national strategies. Additionally, 3.9 trillion yuan of special-purpose bonds for local governments will be issued this year, 100 billion yuan more than last year. China aims to achieve an urban unemployment rate of around 5.5%, create 12 million new urban jobs, and target a consumer price index increase of around 3% for 2024. The work report stressed upon the need to ensure high-quality development, higher security, preventing risks, and maintaining social stability. China also pledged to improve long-term mechanisms for preventing and controlling risks, meet justified financing demands of real estate enterprises, and mitigate local government debt risks while ensuring stable development.\n\nIt might be a good idea to invest in stocks and ETFs from China while they are trading in the red, to benefit from the world\u2019s second largest economy when it\u2019s back on track.

We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. All ETFs have an average trading volume of at least 20,000.  Navigating China's Economy: 10 Best China ETFs\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nNavigating China's Economy: Best China ETFs\n\n10. iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 22: -46.51%\n\niShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI) aims to mirror the performance of the FTSE China 50 Index, consisting of large Chinese equities listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As of March 22, 2024, the ETF holds $4.4 billion in net assets, with an expense ratio of 0.74% and a portfolio comprising 50 stocks. iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI) was launched on October 5, 2004. Despite trading in the red, iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI) is one of the best China ETFs to buy, with average trading volume of 47.3 million as of March 22.\n\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is the largest holding of the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI). Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is a Chinese investment holding company, providing value-added services, online advertising, fintech, and business services.\n\nIn addition to PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is one of the best Chinese stocks.\n\n9. KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 22: -44.33%\n\nKraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB) tracks the CSI Overseas China Internet Index, comprising Chinese companies primarily focused on internet and related technologies. The index provides access to Chinese firms offering services akin to Google, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, and Amazon. It offers exposure to companies benefiting from China's expanding middle class and includes Chinese internet firms listed in the US and Hong Kong. KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB) is one of the best Chinese ETFs, with an expense ratio of 0.69% and net assets amounting to $5.60 billion as of March 21, 2024. The fund was established on July 31, 2013.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the largest holdings of KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB). On March 21, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a 14% increase in active B2B buyers in the US during this year's March Expo, its annual online trade fair. The company also disclosed a 10% year-over-year growth in daily transaction volume for the US market.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 116 hedge funds were bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the largest retailer and e-commerce company in China. Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China\u2019s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were down in the fourth quarter due largely to the delay of the previously announced spin-off of its cloud division. Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China. While the company is seeing early progress in its efforts to re-invigorate customer engagement and retention as well as merchant investment initiatives, we believe this investment will likely take some time to flow through to accelerating earnings growth. As such, we remain investors but have reduced our position as we monitor further progress.\u201d\n\n8. iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (NYSE:EWH)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 22: -39.49%\n\niShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (NYSE:EWH) ranks 8th on our list of the best China ETFs.

AIA Group Limited (HKSE:1299.HK) provides life insurance and financial services, including accident and health insurance, savings plans, and employee benefits.\n\n7. Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 22: -38.99%\n\nInvesco Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ) tracks the NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index, investing primarily in equity securities of companies generating most of their revenues from China. The index consists of US-listed companies headquartered or incorporated in China, and the ETF typically allocates at least 90% of its assets to these securities. Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ) ranks 7th on our list of the best China ETFs. As of March 20, 2024, the fund offers a net expense ratio of 0.70% and a portfolio comprising 62 stocks.\n\nYum China Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YUMC) is one of the largest holdings in Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ)\u2019s portfolio. Yum China Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YUMC) runs restaurants under brands like KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and more. On February 7, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share, a 23.1% increase from its prior dividend of $0.13. The dividend is payable on March 26, to shareholders on record as of March 5. Yum China intends to repurchase $1.25 billion worth of its common stock in 2024 through open market transactions in the United States and Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 22 hedge funds were long Yum China Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE:YUMC) is one of the top Chinese stocks to monitor.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Yum China Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YUMC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cYum China Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YUMC) is the master franchisee for the YUM brands in China and operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant networks in that market. Shares detracted after the company reported a negative surprise on margins for the third quarter and hinted that increased competition and cost-consciousness among Chinese consumers could cause that margin compression to continue through the first quarter of 2024. Although in-year margins are volatile at Yum China, its pristine balance sheet, cumulative investments in technology, unmatched scale, and successful pivot to higher-ROI, smaller footprint stores in recent years should drive continued 8% to 10% store growth at attractive returns. Further, given its strong free-cash-flow generation and strong balance sheet, we believe the company is likely to offer capital returns to shareholders in excess of earnings over the next several years. We remain shareholders.\u201d\n\n6. iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 22: -36.68%\n\niShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) is one of the best China ETFs. iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) aims to mirror the performance of the MSCI China Index, which consists of Chinese equities accessible to international investors. The ETF\u2019s net assets as of March 22, 2024 exceed $5 billion. Its expense ratio came in at 0.59%, along with a portfolio consisting of 661 holdings. iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) was launched on March 29, 2011.\n\nPDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of the top stocks in iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI)\u2019s portfolio. On March 20, PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPADS of $2.40 and a revenue of $12.52 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.75 and $1.68 billion, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 71 hedge funds were long PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), compared to 66 funds in the last quarter. Lei Zhang\u2019s Hillhouse Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 10.1 million shares worth $1.5 billion.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added to our digitization theme by building a position in PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), a leading Chinese e-commerce platform. Founded in 2015, the company has emerged as China\u2019s second largest e-commerce player, capturing approximately 20% market share. In our view, PDD\u2019s competitive moat lies in its team purchase model that facilitates bulk buying through direct partnerships with manufacturers, thereby eliminating intermediaries (e.g., distributors and middlemen) and lowering costs. Key factors driving the company\u2019s meteoric growth include rising consumer demand for affordable products in China amid an economic slowdown, small-scale merchants seeking alternatives to Alibaba, and superior management execution. PDD\u2019s revenue growth outpaces gross merchandize value growth owing to rising take rates as merchants aggressively compete for consumer traffic on the platform. In our view, PDD should continue to gain market share given its dominance in the value-for-money segment, growing affordable branded product offerings, and high operational efficiency. We believe the company\u2019s growth will be further supported by the recent launch of its international e-commerce platform, Temu, which has become one of the fastest growing apps globally. Leveraging China\u2019s excess manufacturing capacity, Temu has strong negotiating power with domestic suppliers and attracts global consumers with competitively priced products. Temu\u2019s recent initiatives to improve unit economics, coupled with achieving variable break even in the sizable U.S. market, showcase management\u2019s skill and commitment to sustained growth. We expect PDD to at least double its earnings and free cash flow in the next three years, with the potential for continued compounding thereafter.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Navigating China's Economy: 5 Best China ETFs.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nCorporate Insiders are Dumping These 11 Tech Stocks 30 Countries With the Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World 16 Hardest Countries to Get Citizenship by Naturalization\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "30 Countries With the Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 30 Countries With The Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to 10 Countries With The Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World.\n\nThe world population is growing fast, and so is the global economy. Today, the global economy stands at $104.48 trillion, with the leading countries having Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures as high as $27.97 trillion. But do these leading countries hold the same rankings and figures when their economic wealth is measured by purchasing power parity (PPP)?\n\nPurchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a macroeconomic concept used to compare the relative value of currencies between different countries. When we say value, we mean how much purchasing a currency can do compared to different countries. So, to find that out, economists apply PPP, which is the exchange rate at which one country's currency would be converted into another to purchase an identical basket of goods and services. The PPP metric is usually used to measure economic productivity and standards of living between countries.\n\nFor instance, a basket of goods and services can cost $100 in the United States, but only about $60 in China. That means the average person in China pays less than the average person in the US to buy the same goods and services. The product doesn\u2019t change, but the difference in currency does, and that affects the quantity that can be purchased by both individuals. However, it\u2019s important to note that it does not necessarily mean the average person in China is richer than the average person in the US. In fact, the US remains the world\u2019s undisputed leader in private wealth creation and accumulation, with a whopping $67 trillion in liquid investable wealth, according to the report published by Henley & Partners.\n\nNonetheless, economists prefer PPP for comparing economic indicators like GDP between countries. When PPP is paired with Nominal GDP, which is the country\u2019s output without accounting for inflation or price changes, we get a more accurate look at a country\u2019s economic output or GDP (PPP). In other words, using purchasing power parity, a GDP is converted to a common baseline currency (International dollars), which helps in more accurately comparing countries and their global standpoints.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of 2024, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region has the highest GDP (PPP) in the world, contributing a whopping $84.82 trillion to the global economy. Meanwhile, the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean are the two regions with the lowest regional GDP (PPP) of $314 billion in total.\n\nOn the other hand, the companies that contribute the most to the global economy based on PPP include the leading corporations, such as Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Tesco Corp (NYSE:TESO).\n\nIn 2024, the global economy seems to be dented by the ongoing global conflicts on one of the key maritime trading gateway, the Red Sea. The Red Sea is a critical route for the freight market as it bridges the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, which accounts for around 12% of global trade. However, due to Israel\u2019s aggression on Palestinian territories, Houthis \u2014 the Yemeni militant group \u2014 have started attacking shipping vessels connected to Israel in an attempt to pressure world leaders to coerce them to take action and put an end to this aggression. Consequently, major shipping liners are opting for an alternate Cape of Good Hope route, which adds about 3,500 nautical miles to the journey. The Red Sea crisis has not only increased delays in cargo shipping but also hiked up the costs of shipping, which has increased the overall prices of goods.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese tech company that specializes in e-commerce and retail. With this threat to the global supply chain, the logistics arm of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Cainiao, will also be majorly impacted by longer delays in shipping to Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), the king of the electric vehicle (EV) market, suspended its car production at its factory near Berlin for two weeks, from Jan 29 to Feb 11, due to the disruption in supply chains by the rising conflicts on the Red Sea. Concurrently, the shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) also declined by 2.9%.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesco Corp (NYSE:TESO) is also one of the leading multinational retailer companies in Europe to face major challenges due to the supply chain disruption caused by the attacks on the Red Sea. The CEO of Tesco Corp (NYSE:TESO), Ken Murphy, showed his concerns and said that if the shipments have to go the whole way around Africa to get to Europe, it will extend shipping times, constrain shipping space, drive up shipping cost, and that could drive inflation on some items. Experts predict that if the Red Sea crisis is not sorted out, Europe's economy will suffer as it heavily depends on the Red Sea maritime route.\n\nBelow, we have listed the top countries with the highest purchasing power parity in the world today.  30 Countries With the Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World\n\n30 Countries With the Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 30 Countries With The Highest Purchasing Power Parity in the World, we calculated the PPP using the GDP per capita by PPP of the fifty top countries with the largest economies in the world and their population.

        "title": "3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For three decades, investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet, innovations and trends that have included genome decoding, businesses-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With machine learning, software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s). It's what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry. It's also what's made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the face of the AI movement\n\nAlthough Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade, and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets, it's high-compute data centers where the company's infrastructure has shone brightest.\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024.\n\nWhat's really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs. Since demand has swamped supply, it's been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available, which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January).\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds' stakes in this Wall Street darling. In particular, three billionaire money managers cut their funds' stake by more than 1 million shares, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 1,088,821 shares sold\n\nWhile some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking, Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year. In addition to increasing external competition, the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers, the potential for margin cannibalization, and ongoing export restrictions to China.\n\nWhat's perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander piled into the \"Magnificent Seven\" of AI stocks\n\nNo billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millennium's Israel Englander. While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Street's top-performing megacap stock, they were mashing the buy button for a trio of \"Magnificent Seven\" components, including:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 85,532 shares purchased\n\nThe \"why?\" behind these buys is simple: They're respective industry leaders. Alphabet's Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the world's leading online retail site, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend. Lastly, Apple's iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share.\n\nBut these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth. Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidia's top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips. Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers.\n\nApple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own, with the company's processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook. For the moment, Apple's AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions, such as predictive text on the iPhone.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidia's peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBillionaire Jeff Yass added shares of time-tested AI businesses that would be AI-bubble resistant\n\nThe second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehanna's Jeff Yass. While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds' Nvidia stake by 27%, they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble, including:\n\nAlibaba(NYSE: BABA): 5,297,854 shares purchased Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 527,008 shares purchased Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 115,276 shares purchased\n\nAs noted, the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst, their core operations would, presumably, prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft. For example, Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce platform, with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales. Alibaba Cloud is also No. 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages.\n\nTesla is North America's largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's been generating a recurring profit. Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology, the company's success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs. If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst, Tesla's operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on, such as Windows and Office, as well as its high-growth initiatives, which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend, behind only AWS. Although Microsoft is betting big on AI, arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla, it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen gobbled up AI ancillary stocks in place of Nvidia\n\nThe final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72's stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66%, they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement, including:\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL): 2,178,533 shares purchased Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC): 971,494 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) 670,677 shares purchased Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG): 301,908 shares purchased\n\nSimilar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna, Point72's investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts. Whereas total sales for Oracle's recently reported quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) were up just 7%, infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period. While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset, it's well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure.\n\nWestern Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage. Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending, the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management. It could pave a path for the company's high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize. Nevertheless, it's witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Though this makes up a small percentage of Dell's business at the moment, it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate.\n\nCohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical. This is a company that's utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications. No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place since this century began.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s revenue missed estimates, in another sign that China\u2019s faltering economic recovery is taking a toll on its gaming and social media portfolios.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago\u2019s Most Elite Neighborhood What Happens If Trump Can\u2019t Post His $454 Million Bond Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nRevenue rose a less-than-expected 7% to 155.2 billion yuan ($21.6 billion) for the three months ended December, compared with the 157.4 billion yuan average forecast. Net income was 27 billion yuan, versus the 33.3 billion yuan projected. On Wednesday, Tencent also said it was at least doubling its share buyback program to more than HK$100 billion ($12.8 billion) in 2024.\n\nThe results cast doubt over the growth trajectory of the world\u2019s largest internet arena, which has yet to bounce back fully from years of regulatory and economic turmoil. Investors are grappling with mixed signals about the Chinese economy, which has struggled to regain its pre-Covid velocity.\n\nBeijing\u2019s government is still contending with a plethora of structural problems from a prolonged property crisis to stubborn inflation. Economic data released Monday, including retail sales, suggested stimulus by policymakers has finally started to pay off.\n\nSome of China\u2019s biggest tech names have sought to ramp up shareholder returns after delivering mixed results.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. unveiled $25 billion in fresh stock repurchases following disappointing December-quarter sales, while JD.com Inc.\u2019s $3 billion buyback program propelled its shares higher. Tencent\u2019s closest gaming rival, NetEase Inc., more than doubled its dividend payout from a year ago, after both revenue and earnings missed estimates.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTencent\u2019s growth is set to normalize in 2024, though it should still deliver mid-teen earnings growth, driven by continued strength in short videos and AI-enhanced ads; underpinned by cost discipline and a stabilizing regulatory environment. While Tencent continues to face medium-term structural headwinds, its revenue base is relatively well diversified, in contrast with its e-commerce peers.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Robert Lea, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nTencent faces its own challenges beyond macroeconomic uncertainties. While WeChat has proven a reliable growth driver after its short-video feed lured users and advertisers back from ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s Douyin, the company still needs to figure out where the rest of its sprawling business empire is heading.\n\nIt\u2019s struggling to retain paid subscribers on its video and music streaming services, and its cloud computing arm is in the midst of a price war with Alibaba and JD, just as that unit was seeking to reach profitability.\n\nOnce its bread-and-butter, Tencent\u2019s games division is also seeking its next big hit.\n\nSales of new casual title Dream Star declined in recent months thanks to fierce competition with NetEase, but the highly anticipated Dungeon & Fighter Mobile could help pick up the slack after the action game won a long overdue license in February.\n\nThe urgency for new gaming hits comes at a time when Beijing is again potentially ramping up scrutiny over the sector. In December, the industry regulator spooked investors by proposing new curbs on gaming content and monetization, including a cap on in-game spending it never specified. The watchdog has since signaled its intention to hear the industry out and possibly roll back some of the harsher edicts, though a final version of the rules has yet to be published after public consultation ended in January.\n\nTencent, however, has found an unlikely ally in ByteDance. The Shenzhen-based company has scooped up some talent and in-game assets from TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, after ByteDance curtailed its game ambitions, Bloomberg News has reported. Tencent also recently allowed Douyin creators to stream and reproduce content off its mainstay games, including Honor of Kings and League of Legends. That ended a years-long, unofficial ban on both sides around running content from a rival.\n\nLonger run, Tencent joins much of the Chinese tech sector in exploring the potential of generative AI. Its in-house large language model, Hunyuan, is now integrated with a suite of products including search and online marketing. Alongside arch-foe Alibaba, the WeChat operator has also made multiple bets on domestic AI model startups, helping mint new unicorns like Baichuan and Minimax.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Don Lemon Implosion China\u2019s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers\u2019 $700 Million Man, Will Transform Baseball\u2014If He Wants To Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say Dollar\u2019s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -0.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.84 indicates a change of -0.3% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alibaba is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $31.19 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. The $131.88 billion and $141.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.6% and +7.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $36.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.46%. The EPS surprise was -2.2%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Hou will retire but serve as a senior adviser to the company, the person said, asking not to be named discussing private plans.\n\nThe decision, first reported by the Late Post, is the latest in a series of changes at Alibaba after missteps and regulatory scrutiny eroded its position against rivals like PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd. Once the most valuable company in China, Alibaba has sought to claw its way back to growth, initially with a plan to split into six parts. That effort has hit major bumps, including the abrupt departure of former CEO Daniel Zhang and the delay of a Hong Kong initial public offering for Freshippo due to weak market sentiment.\n\nTo revive growth, the company has been promoting a plethora of young executives to lead different business lines, across its key cloud computing division and its core domestic commerce business, in recent months.\n\nThe company is also exploring ways to unload assets and dial back Zhang\u2019s years-long \u201cnew retail\u201d ambition.

Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve's next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"Based on his [Powell's] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.\"\n\nAccording to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on.\n\nThe NVIDIA GTC Conference\n\nApart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as\u00a0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present.\u00a0 On March 15, CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos joined the \"Halftime Report\" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here's what she said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA's] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We'll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD's latest chip, then that's gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we'll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that'll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.\"\n\nThese comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops. Tech is an area that makes up a large part of the list of most owned stocks by hedge funds today. As such, our list below contains many of the fastest growing technology companies in the US, alongside some of the best American tech stocks to buy. 20 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now\n\nA financial analyst looking at a monitor displaying the stocks of the public company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds now, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter and selected the top 20 stocks with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nMost Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now\n\n20.

The company generates over half of its revenue in the U.S. from its top-selling drugs Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz.

Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We belief the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.\u201d\n\n18. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NYSE:JPM) performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.\u201d\n\n17.

Though we do not currently own it in the Portfolio, Taiwan Semiconductor was one of the larger relative detractors from performance during the quarter due to its strong performance and comparatively greater index weight.\u201d\n\n15. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China\u2019s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were down in the fourth quarter due largely to the delay of the previously announced spin-off of its cloud division. Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China. While the company is seeing early progress in its efforts to re-invigorate customer engagement and retention as well as merchant investment initiatives, we believe this investment will likely take some time to flow through to accelerating earnings growth. As such, we remain investors but have reduced our position as we monitor further progress.\u201d\n\n12. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOn the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we\u2019ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it\u2019s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We\u2019ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we\u2019re trying to \u201clet winners run\u201d while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.\u201d\n\n10. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 129\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, 129 hedge funds were long Uber Technologies, Inc.

It develops and operates proprietary tech applications across the globe, offering ride-hailing services to customers worldwide.\n\nOn March 15, Piper Sandler analysts maintained an Overweight rating and a $92 price target on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER).\n\nHere's what RiverPark Advisors said about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management\u2019s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year\u2019s free cash flow.\u201d\n\n9. salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an application software company.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 10 Biggest Countries on Earth by Area.\n\nSome of the Largest Economies by Area\n\nAccording to a report by the International Monetary Fund, the 3 largest economies for 2024 are expected to be the United States, China, and Germany. The U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States increased by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the number of jobs also saw an increase of \u00a02.7 million. Reports suggest that consumer spending in the US has been consistently increasing, with high retail sales. A 4.2% increase in citizens' disposable income suggests that US citizens have the flexibility to spend and invest. Moreover, a 4.5% increase in personal savings rate is also a positive indicator that the economy of the US is stable, with citizens leading comfortable lives.\n\nOn January 26, Reuters reported that China's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 5.2% in 2023, compared to the previous year. In 2023, China faced weak investor confidence and smaller businesses in China suffered without adequate investments. However, estimates suggest that the country's GDP is set to increase by 5% in 2024.\n\nCanada is one of the biggest economies of the biggest countries on Earth by area. The country's economy is heavily dependent on international trade as it accounts for one-third of the country's GDP. According to data provided by World Economics, Canada's GDP for 2023 was approximately $1.928 trillion. The services industry, real estate industry, and mining are key industries in the country and have helped sustain Canada's economy.\n\nBusiness in the Biggest Countries on Earth\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), and Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) are some of the biggest companies in the top 3 biggest countries on Earth by area.

Here are some comments from the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, we generated US$25 billion in free cash flow that was mainly contributed by this business, and we believe it will continue to generate strong free cash flow in the future. In the future, as a result of the reorganization, our additional source of funds will come from monetization of our consolidated businesses. As Daniel mentioned, our Board has approved the following transactions as initial phase of our capital management planning. First, for Alibaba International Digital Commerce Business Group, or AIDC, we are confident of its opportunities and growth prospect, and we plan to start its external financing process.

Here are some comments from the company's Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\nWe believe there's significant opportunity for continued growth and we will continue to invest in advisor recruitment across North America. In contrast, net interest income in our Wealth Management businesses were impacted by similar trends seen in Canadian Banking, namely a shift from deposits into higher-yielding products. RBC Global Asset Management's AUM increased 6% from last year, benefiting from higher markets. Canadian retail net outflows this quarter were less than 1% of opening AUM, outperforming the industry, which has faced a challenging backdrop over the last year. We are confident that our leading franchises are well positioned to capture money in motion back into investment products, following a shift in the interest rate outlook and risk sentiment, particularly when it comes to fixed income strategies, which is one of our core strengths.\n\nWith this context in mind, let's look at the 50 biggest countries on Earth by area.

        "title": "Better Growth Stock: Baidu vs. Alibaba",
        "content": "Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) and Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) were both once considered relatively safe plays on the Chinese economy's long-term growth. Baidu owns the country's leading search engine, while Alibaba operates its largest e-commerce marketplaces and its most widely used cloud infrastructure platform.\n\nBut over the past three years, Baidu's stock declined 60% as Alibaba's stock sank 68%. Let's see why these two Chinese tech stalwarts stumbled, and if either one is still worth buying as a turnaround play. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBaidu's core business is maturing\n\nBaidu still controls 60% of China's search market, according to StatCounter, but it faces fierce competition from other popular platforms like Tencent's Weixin (called WeChat overseas), ByteDance's Douyin (known as TikTok overseas), and Alibaba's e-commerce marketplaces, which all offer their own integrated search tools.\n\nBaidu is trying to counter that trend by expanding its Managed Business Pages, which enable companies to run their own online stores and websites within Baidu's ecosystem, and expanding its namesake mobile app into an all-in-one \"super app\" like Weixin. Baidu is also upgrading its cloud infrastructure platform to reduce its long-term dependence on online ads, and the company is investing in the AI market's secular growth with its Ernie natural language processing platform, generative AI services, and its Apollo driverless vehicle platform. Its streaming video platform iQiyi also finally turned profitable in 2023.\n\nThose are all steps in the right direction, but Baidu still generated more than half of its revenue from its online marketing business in 2023. The company's total revenue rose 6% for the year, but that marked a major improvement from its 8% decline in 2022. For 2024, analysts expect Baidu's revenue and earnings to rise 8% and 15%, respectively. The company's advertising and cloud businesses should stabilize as China's macro environment improves, and Baidu stock looks cheap at 12 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba's business is recovering\n\nAlibaba's headaches started after China's antitrust regulators cracked down on its e-commerce platforms in 2021. The company was hit with a record $2.75 billion fine and forced to end its exclusive deals with merchants, limit its promotional strategies, and seek the government's approval for any major investments or acquisitions.\n\nThose draconian restrictions narrowed Alibaba's moat against its aggressive competitors like PDD and JD.com. China's economic slowdown and unpredictable \"zero COVID\" lockdowns exacerbated that pressure. Alibaba's cloud business also struggled with sluggish enterprise spending and its declining revenue from ByteDance, which shifted the data of TikTok's U.S. users to Oracle's servers in 2022.\n\nAlibaba's revenue rose only 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last March), compared to its 19% growth in fiscal 2022. However, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 9% and 45%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as two tailwinds kick in.\n\nFirst, the company expects the expansion of its higher-growth overseas e-commerce business -- which houses its Southeast Asia marketplace Lazada, its Turkey marketplace Trendyol, and its cross-border marketplace AliExpress -- to offset the slower growth of Taobao and Tmall in China. Second, Alibaba is expanding its Cainiao logistics division with more services for third-party customers to boost its sales and operating margins. Alibaba stock also looks like a bargain at eleven times forward earnings.\n\nBoth companies face regulatory challenges\n\nBaidu and Alibaba should both overcome their recent slowdowns, but their stocks still trade at low valuations because they face unpredictable regulatory challenges in the U.S. and China.\n\nFor example, the recent export curbs on advanced AI chips to China could make it harder for both companies to expand their AI and cloud ecosystems. Both tech giants could also face additional pressure from China's antitrust regulators as they expand their businesses.\n\nUnless Baidu and Alibaba definitively overcome those challenges, their stocks could continue to trade at steep discounts to their American counterparts.\n\nThe better buy: Baidu\n\nI'm not a fan of either of these stocks right now, since it's easier to find better growth plays in the U.S. market with fewer regulatory issues. But if I had to choose one, I'd buy Baidu -- its growth rates are more stable, it faces less scrutiny from China's antitrust regulators, and its business is better diversified. Alibaba needs to stabilize its Chinese e-commerce and cloud businesses instead of repeatedly touting its overseas growth before I consider it to be an undervalued growth play again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Baidu wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "JD.com: Short-Term Gain and Long-Term Pain",
        "content": "JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 on March 6. The quarterly results were better than expected, particularly in terms of revenue growth. Profitability declined, but this was widely anticipated. CEO Sandy Xu said, \"JD's proactive actions have begun to produce results as our decisive focus on user experience, price competitiveness and platform ecosystem drives deeper and more frequent user engagement and healthier user growth momentum.\"\n\nAlong with the earnings release, the Chinese e-commerce company also announced a $3 billion share repurchase program and declared an annual cash dividend of 76 cents per American depository receipt. The stock surged more than 16% after the earnings release as investors cheered the earnings beat and shareholder return initiatives.\n\nAt first glance, JD's fourth-quarter results appear to be very encouraging. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes plausible that the seemingly good quarterly results are achieved at the cost of potential erosion of its moat. In the long run, this could have significant implications for JD's competitiveness.\n\nEarnings summary\n\nJD's net revenue increased 3.60% from the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP income from operations increased 6.80% year over year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the company's ordinary shareholders grew 9.10%.\n\nThe company's income grew faster than revenue because of effective expense and cost control. For the quarter, cost of revenue increased 3.40%, while research and development expenses decreased 0.60% and general and administrative costs decreased 34.80%. However, marketing expenses rose 9.40% due to increased spending on promotional activities.\n\nJD's heavy spending in promotional activities resulted in higher user shopping frequency and higher volume growth. Management shared more details on how the company achieved better user engagement during the earnings call:\n\nIn Q4, we saw the number of quarterly active customers accelerate at JD Group level. This increase was particularly driven by the growth of our loyal existing users and plus members. In addition, the JD Plus growth also translated to a robust order volume growth, hitting double-digit year-on-year in Q4 and accelerating for 3 consecutive quarters. In terms of JD Plus, we saw another quarter of robust growth of its member base and GMV contributed by plus members grew faster than our total GMV in Q4. The promising progress in user engagement is a result of our stepped-up efforts in improving user experience, low price offerings and implementing platform ecosystem strategies. Looking at our efforts in improving user experience. In addition to our previously launched popular initiatives such as free shipping, instant refunds and one click for best price guaranteed, we also recently launched new customer services such as free doorstep pickup for returns, cashback for delayed shipping. As a result, our Net Promoter Score, the NPS, for both our 1P and 3P business have improved substantially in Q4.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeeling the onion\n\nOnce we start to peel back the layers, we can further inspect the specific actions JD's management team took to drive the user shopping frequency growth and order volume growth. We also notice the inconsistency between management's words and the financial numbers.\n\nFirst of all, as management pointed out, the number of users from lower tier markets grew faster in Q4 compared to previous quarters. This positive development is encouraging since JD has historically demonstrated strong performance in tier-1 and tier-2 cities, but struggled to keep up with Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) and Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Taobao in lower-tier markets. Now, it seems JD is making progress in bridging that gap.\n\nSecond, management noted that low ticket size orders further sped up and far exceeded the growth of JD's total order volume in Q4. JD's management implied that growth in low ticket size is due to price competitiveness, which is not supported by subsidies, but by supply chain capabilities. This is where I noticed the inconsistency between management's words and JD's financial numbers. During the quarter, marketing expenses actually increased by 9.40%, significantly outpacing the revenue growth of 3.60%. And JD said specifically in the earnings release that the increase in marketing expense was\"due to increased spending in promotion activities.\" So clearly the growth in low ticket size orders was driven by subsidies, at least to some extent.\n\nLastly, the increased number of active third-party merchants also drove user purchase frequency growth and order volume growth. Management noted that 3P users and 3P order volume both saw accelerated growth year-on-year in Q4 and in the full year of 2023. From day one, JD's moat has been the relentless focus on authenticity and better quality. The bedrock of product authenticity and quality is first-party and JD's own logistics system. Accelerating the growth of the company's third-party business will certainly lead to a decline in product quality and an increase in user dissatisfaction. Therefore, management's pursuit of growth in third-party merchants and order volume indicate JD's management is willing to sacrifice long-term user value to drive short-term growth. This means its quarterly financial numbers, especially the revenue growth numbers, may look good in the near term. However, over the long term, its financial statements will properly reflect the potential impact of this strategic decision, which could prove to be a costly mistake.\n\nBalanced shareholder return program\n\nAlong with the earnings release, JD announced a $3 billion share repurchase program and declared an annual cash dividend of 76 cents per ADR. As I previously stated in my analyis of Alibaba's fourth-quarter earnings:\n\nI think the company should think about paying more dividends to shareholders as opposed to merely increasing share buybacks because Alibaba's intrinsic value may decline in the future. If its intrinsic value does decline in the future, a cash dividend is a better option for shareholders compared to share repurchases.\n\nTherefore, I absolutely applaud management's efforts because JD's shareholder return program is much more balanced than Alibaba.\n\nConclusion\n\nJD's quarterly revenue growth has picked up as a result of management's actions aimed at driving short-term order growth and increasing user frequency. While these actions may yield positive results in the near term, they are likely to gradually erode JD's long-term competitive advantage. Therefore, it is crucial for shareholders to consider the long-term consequences of these strategic actions.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "An apparent effort at muscling into the e-commerce market of a neighboring country wasn't very impressive to Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) investors on Thursday. They traded out of the Chinese online retailer's stock, to the point where its U.S.-listed shares closed the day down by 3.9%. In contrast, the slumping S&P 500 index shed only 0.3% of its value.\n\nA renewed push in South Korea?\n\nNikkei Asia, quoting a report from South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, published an article stating that Alibaba is to invest $1.1 billion in that country. The intent is to establish a logistics network in order to compete with that country's e-commerce leader Coupang.\n\nAlibaba will apparently leverage its ability to offer low prices, and with a strong logistics effort it will get goods to customers rapidly.\n\nAlibaba's AliExpress brand already has a presence in South Korea; it was rolled out in 2018. The company's plans would expand AliExpress' footprint significantly -- for example it plans to build a logistics hub on a 180,000 square meter lot near the national capital of Seoul. The article stated that the company is currently in the process of choosing a location.\n\nOther plans include a 300-employee call center, and a purchasing division that will sell Korean products abroad.\n\nAlibaba has not yet officially commented on the report.\n\nOne tough market\n\nAlthough South Korea is geographically far smaller than China, it nevertheless has a well-established and thriving market economy full of hardened competitors. And while Alibaba already has a foothold in that market, it's going against that country's 300-pound online retail gorilla.

        "title": "Dealing With Unrecognized Risks",
        "content": "I previously wrote about key takeaways from Warren Buffett's (Trades, Portfolio) 2023 letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders. One section that particularly caught me off guard was the guru's revelation he failed to consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns for Berkshire Hathaway Energy. His failure to consider a significant risk echoes a similar mistake made by the late Charlie Munger, who underestimated the competitive risk with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), a substantial investment for Daily Journal's (NASDAQ:DJCO) portfolio. The inadequate and insufficient risk assessment by both investors raises a pertinent question for every value investor: How can we deal with unrecognized risks?\n\nIn this discussion, I will attempt to provide a preliminary answer.\n\nUnknowable risks versus unrecognized risks\n\nFirst, it is crucial to distinguish between an unknowable risk and an unrecognized one. An unknowable risk is similar to a \"black swan\" event in that it cannot be identified or objectively measured in advance. Covid-19 could be considered such a risk as it was virtually impossible for almost any investor to objectively assess the likelihood of a global pandemic in any given year. Conversely, an unrecognized risk is one that could have been objectively measured beforehand but was not identified, analyzed or evaluated.\n\nIn essence, an unrecognized risk is a knowable, recognizable and quantifiable risk. Yet, for any number of reasons, an investor fails to take it into account. This is the case for Buffett with regards to Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as well as for Munger with regards to Alibaba.\n\nUnrecognized risks can be attributed to many factors. Among the most common reasons why value investors overlook identifiable yet unrecognized risks are:\n\nStepping out of one's circle of competence. An investor may not have the necessary information, knowledge or expertise to identify all potential risks. I think Munger's mistake with Alibaba falls into this category as he evidently did not grasp the intricacies of China's competitive e-commerce landscape. Changing business environment. For some businesses, the environment in which they operate may change over time, creating new risks that were not previously present. The emergence of new technologies or changes in regulations are the two most common factors that create new unrecognized risks. This was the case for Buffett's mistake with Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Lack of complete and accurate information. An investor may understand a business, but may miss a major negative development due to complacency, sloth or insufficient monitoring. An example that comes to my mind is Berkshire's late response to Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) significant issues. Buffett and Munger sure understood the bank, but they were not paying enough attention to assess the magnitude of its issues.\n\nStory continues\n\nMitigating the impact of unrecognized risks\n\nThe nature of unrecognized risks makes it particularly troublesome for value investors. Even Buffett and Munger, two of the greatest value investors ever, stumbled upon unrecognized risks in their hugely successful careers. The challenge lies in the fact that unrecognized risks often remain hidden, especially for businesses with attractive valuations such as Alibaba or better-than-average businesses such as Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\n\nFaced with this challenge, the most important thing for any value investor is to always conduct thorough research in order to develop an adequate understanding of the underlying businesses. The research process should at least include a careful analysis of financial statements, an understanding of the company's competitive position in its industry and an assessment of management's competency and integrity. Additionally, investors should stay updated on recent industry trends and developments that could have adverse impacts on the business. Without diligent and thorough research, value investors are at risk of making decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information.\n\nBut even with diligent and thorough research, value investors may still fail to recognize an important and recognizable risk. This is when the margin of safety framework comes into play. I think the application of margin of safety should not be not limited to valuation. It should extend to risk assessment as well. Specifically, when contemplating the risks associated with a particular investment, value investors should assume some recognizable and important risks might be missing from the analysis.\n\nThe application of the margin of safety framework in risk assessment means value investors should always prepare for the possibility of overlooking important risks and come up with a methodology to deal with such a scenario. For instance, value investors might apply a higher discount rate for businesses operating in specific industries, thereby lowering the calculated intrinsic value. Alternatively, they could reduce the portfolio weighting of companies facing heightened technological and regulatory risks. In an extreme case, a value investor's best option is to stay away from fast-changing and highly regulated industries.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be impossible to eliminate all risks, value investors can take proactive measures to mitigate the adverse impact of unrecognized risks.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nBuffett's 2023 shareholder letter reminds us again that value investors should always behave prudently. By acknowledging the potential for unrecognized risks and implementing risk-mitigating measures to their investment process, value investors can better navigate the ever-changing investing world. As Benjamin Graham shrewdly pointed out, \"The essence of investment management is the management of risks, not the management of returns.\"\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

We are simply suspecting we have elements that they are not compliant with. This is not a finding of a breach,\" one of the officials said.\n\nAliExpress said it respected all applicable rules and regulations in the markets where it operates.\n\n\"...we have been working with, and will continue to work with, the relevant authorities on making sure we comply with applicable standards and will continue to ensure that we will be able to meet the requirements of the DSA,\" the company said\n\n\"AliExpress is committed to creating a safe and compliant marketplace for all consumers.\"\n\nSo-called VLOPs like AliExpress - or very large online platforms - are companies with more than 45 million users in Europe that are subject to the toughest DSA rules. Violations can lead to fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nThe Commission on Thursday also sent requests for information to Microsoft's Bing, Google Search , Meta Platforms' Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, ByteDance's TikTok and Elon Musk's X over their use of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nCommission officials said they want to know whether the companies conduct risk assessments and have risk mitigation measures to tackle potentially harmful generative AI content.\n\n\"We are of course concerned with the harmful category, whether it is deep fake news or election-relevant deep fakes that seek to manipulate the public environment,\" the officials said.\n\nThe companies have until April 3 to reply to questions related to the protection of elections and April 24 on other matters.\n\nThe growing popularity of generative AI systems such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini has fuelled concerns about misinformation and fake news.\n\nThe Commission also sent a request for information to Microsoft's Linkedin over the potential use of personal data for targeted advertising following a complaint from civil society organisations, giving it an April 5 deadline to respond.\n\nThe probes into X and TikTok are ongoing.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best stocks under $100 to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of the current stock market climate, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Stocks Under $100 To Buy Now.\n\nAs the fourth quarter of the 2023 earnings season slowed down in February 2024, stock market investor attention reverted to interest rates, inflation, and the economy. The three indicators have worked in tandem to determine investor sentiment over the course of the past couple of years, and right now, it appears that inflation might take a bit longer to stamp out. Additionally, the latest update on the economic front saw a downward revision to the fourth quarter - an unsurprising development considering the broader global slowdown and the high interest rates that have made it harder for U.S. businesses to focus on growth.\n\nFebruary 2024 is coming to a sharp end as investors wait for the latest personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index to determine the Federal Reserve's mood when it comes to reducing interest rates. The PCE data for January will let the central bank decide whether it needs to keep interest rates higher for longer, and heading into its meeting, officials will be acutely aware of the fact that the U.S. GDP growth of 3.3% in the fourth quarter was revised downwards to 3.2%. While the scale of the revision is comforting, it nevertheless demonstrates that the effect of interest rates is continuing to creep up on the economy as more data becomes available for robust estimates.\n\nYet, the fact that other major economies such as the U.K., Germany, and China aren't doing so well can nevertheless see a central bank that feels more comfortable with higher interest rates than Wall Street would like it to be. Heading into the PCE data release, the NASDAQ and S&P shed 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, while the Dow remained flat. As indexes drop, and despite the fact that it can potentially create room for higher rates, the economy is nevertheless doing well; an important consideration when we remember the worries of a recession in late 2022 and the depressed stock market environment during such a downturn.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn this front, a fresh report from Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) sheds more light on what small businesses and stock market investors can expect from the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. According to the bank's chief U.S. economist Marc Giannoni, sizeable labor growth through avenues such as immigration can end up boosting American productivity for years. Should this occur, then the central bank might very well upgrade a key metric that is known in economic circles as the neutral interest rate. While most folks are concerned about their home loan interests, officials at the Fed spend countless hours wondering what the interest rate can be to allow the U.S. economy to grow and not cause inflationary spikes.\n\nA higher neutral rate means that officials can keep rates high and not worry about any impacts on growth. As the Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari wrote in February:\n\nThis constellation of data suggests to me that the current stance of monetary policy, which, again, includes the current level and expected paths of the federal funds rate and balance sheet, may not be as tight as we would have assumed given the low neutral rate environment that existed before the pandemic. It is possible, at least during the post-pandemic recovery period, that the policy stance that represents neutral has increased. The implication of this is that, I believe, it gives the FOMC time to assess upcoming economic data before starting to lower the federal funds rate, with less risk that too-tight policy is going to derail the economic recovery.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some best stocks under $100 to buy now. A couple of top names are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). 15 Best Stocks Under $100 To Buy Now\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best stocks under $100, we ranked the 40 most valuable stocks with share prices below $100 by market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023 and chose those with the highest investors.\n\nFor these best stocks under $100, we used we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best emerging market ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on emerging market economic outlook, head over ETFs in an Emerging Market: 5 Best ETFs To Buy.\n\nGlobal interest rates have experienced volatility, particularly on longer-term government bonds, with 10-year US Treasury yields climbing again after a brief retreat. However, emerging market economies have witnessed milder rate movements. Despite historical expectations of substantial spillovers from advanced economies' interest rates to emerging markets, major emerging markets, especially in Asia, have shown increased resilience to global interest rate volatility. This resilience is underscored by stable exchange rates, stock prices, and sovereign spreads, as well as continued investor interest in emerging market bond markets despite heightened volatility. Many emerging markets have strengthened their policy frameworks over the years, accumulating currency reserves, refining exchange-rate arrangements, and improving central bank independence and credibility. During the post-pandemic era, emerging market central banks have raised interest rates earlier and by wider margins compared to advanced economies, creating buffers against external pressures. Additionally, the rise in commodity prices during the pandemic has supported the external positions of commodity-producing emerging markets.\n\nGlobalxETFssuggests that investors reassess their underweight positions in emerging markets (EM), as the asset class shows potential for outperformance in 2024. Despite representing a significant portion of global land, population, and GDP growth, EM countries account for only a small fraction of global market cap. Currently, EM equities are trading at historically low valuations compared to the United States, indicating a margin of safety and potential for growth, especially with the prospect of a weaker US dollar. Brazil is seen as a promising cyclical opportunity for 2024, with the Central Bank cutting interest rates significantly, historically leading to rallies in the MSCI Brazil Index. India is viewed as offering strong structural growth potential, supported by its large, educated population and market-friendly government. China is considered to have reached a point of \"peak pessimism,\" with consumer names appearing attractive from a valuation and earnings perspective. Greece, having received an investment-grade upgrade, is seen as poised for performance in 2024 due to its attractive valuation and political and economic momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the US dollar is identified as a key driver of broad EM equity performance, with EM equities historically displaying an inverse relationship with the dollar. Expectations for EM EBITDA growth are optimistic, driven by factors such as China's reopening, India's momentum, and monetary easing across Latin America. With interest rates potentially stabilizing, investors may turn to EM for growth opportunities, particularly in a weaker dollar environment. EM has historically performed well following the last hike of a rate cycle.\n\nFranklin Templetonexpresses optimism regarding equity markets in 2024, citing factors such as the expectation of a recovery in earnings growth, a probable soft economic landing in the US, and signs indicating that interest rates have peaked. They highlight the historical trend of emerging market equities rising following the first Federal Reserve rate cut. With over four billion people participating in elections throughout the year, including key countries like India, Indonesia, and Mexico, political stability is anticipated to support market sentiment. In India, the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to retain power, benefiting from ongoing reforms. Consensus forecasts anticipate a rebound in global earnings growth, particularly in emerging markets such as South Korea and Taiwan, which are projected to drive earnings growth in the region by 18% in 2024. Despite this, emerging market equities' price-to-earnings (PE) ratios remain below their long-term averages, potentially offering investment opportunities. While China's economic outlook remains challenging, signs of stabilization are welcomed, and select Chinese companies are seen as oversold, presenting potential investment opportunities.\n\nExchange traded funds act as convenient investment vehicles for investors to explore and benefit from emerging markets.

We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi\u2019s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\n\n9. iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:IEMG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Returns as of March 12, 2024: 15.66%\n\niShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:IEMG) ranks 9th on our list of the best emerging market ETFs. iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:IEMG) aims to replicate the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets IMI Net Index, comprising large, mid, and small-cap equities in emerging markets. Established on October 18, 2012, the fund holds $76 billion in net assets, with a net expense ratio of 0.09%.

Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VWO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Returns as of March 12, 2024: 16.80%\n\nVanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VWO) is one of the best emerging market ETFs to buy. Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VWO) invests in stocks of companies located in global emerging markets, including China, Brazil, Taiwan, and South Africa. Its objective is to closely mirror the performance of the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. As of February 27, 2024, Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VWO) has an expense ratio of 0.08%. The fund's portfolio comprises 5,781 stocks, and as of January 31, 2024, it holds net assets totaling $97.9 billion.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the biggest holdings of Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VWO).

The discounted services extend to over 100 products, including data storage and elastic computing options for online processing power.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was part of 116 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 110 in the last quarter.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the largest retailer and e-commerce company in China. Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China\u2019s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were down in the fourth quarter due largely to the delay of the previously announced spin-off of its cloud division. Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China. While the company is seeing early progress in its efforts to re-invigorate customer engagement and retention as well as merchant investment initiatives, we believe this investment will likely take some time to flow through to accelerating earnings growth. As such, we remain investors but have reduced our position as we monitor further progress.\u201d\n\n7.

Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (NYSE:FNDE)\n\n5-Year Share Price Returns as of March 12, 2024: 22.23%\n\nSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (NYSE:FNDE) aims to mirror the performance of the Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Company Index, excluding fees and expenses. Launched on August 15, 2013, Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (NYSE:FNDE) holds $5.52 billion in net assets, with a net expense ratio of 0.390%. Its portfolio comprises 391 stocks as of March 11, 2024. Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (NYSE:FNDE) ranks 6th on our list of the best emerging market ETFs.\n\nPetr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) is one of the top holdings of Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (NYSE:FNDE). Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) is a Brazilian oil and gas company involved in exploration, production, refining, transportation, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas products domestically and internationally. Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates announced plans on February 20 to invest approximately $1.5 billion, alongside partners, in deploying a decarbonization technology at one of their oilfields. Success in this pilot project could lead to broader application of the technology across other oilfields, ultimately reducing Petrobras' carbon emissions.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 36 hedge funds were bullish on Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), same as the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 213.16 million shares worth $3.4 billion.\n\nLike Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), and Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY), Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) is one of the best emerging markets stocks to consider.\n\nFairlight Capital made the following comment about Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. \u2013 Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThroughout the year, we have reviewed thousands of companies, including many in the oil sector. While we are generally cautious about commodity-based businesses where the company lacks control over the price of what it produces, the valuations in several cases have reached extremely compelling levels. For example, Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. \u2013 Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) and Ecopetrol (EC). Petrobras has distributed dividends of over $2.30 paid this year3 , while Ecopetrol has traded as cheaply as the $9-$10 range (close to our purchase price) and is paying approximately $2.50 in dividends this year.\n\nWe factor in the potential cost of FX movements over time, but even under the most pessimistic scenarios the investments should work out well. We initially came across these ideas while looking at South American stocks in general. We saw that many market commentators had expressed concerns that Ecopetrol\u2019s dividends might be halted, especially following the election of Gustavo Petro as president of Colombia in June 2022. Similarly, there have been reservations about the sustainability of Petrobras\u2019s dividend. However, the government owns substantial controlling stakes in these companies and is also a recipient of their dividends. For Ecopetrol, the Colombian government owes money to Ecopetrol due to the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC). This fund aims to stabilize fuel prices for Colombian consumers. It bridges the gap between international and national Colombian consumer prices by compensating producers and importers for this price difference. The primary goal is to cushion the impact of global oil price fluctuations on the Colombian market. This is achieved either through cash payment or by forgoing dividend payments due from the government\u2019s stake in these companies. In Ecopetrol\u2019s case, the dividends paid (or those that would be paid to the government) are applied against the outstanding balances\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nClick to continue reading and see ETFs in an Emerging Market: 5 Best ETFs To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Biggest Telecom Companies in the US 25 Countries With The Highest Number of Internet Users in 2024 11 Best Vanguard ETFs For 2024\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy With $300 Right Now",
        "content": "Wall Street volatility has been on display since this decade began. In each of the past four years, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite, have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years.\n\nFor the moment, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street, with all three major indexes rallying to record-closing highs in 2024. But just because the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite are breaking through their previous ceilings, it doesn't mean amazing deals can't still be uncovered by opportunistic investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWith most brokerages doing away with barriers to investment, it's an especially smart time to put your money to work on Wall Street. In recent years, most online brokers have eliminated minimum deposit requirements and commission fees associated with common stock trades on major U.S. exchanges. For retail investors, it means any amount of money -- even $300 -- can be the perfect amount to invest.\n\nIf you have $300 that's ready to be put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses when they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now.\n\nBank of America\n\nThe first reliable industry leader that looks like a phenomenal deal for investors with $300 in available cash is Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), which is commonly referred to as \"BofA.\"\n\nIf there's a knock against U.S. bank stocks, it's that they're inherently cyclical. This is to say that they ebb-and-flow with the health of the U.S. economy. Over the past couple of months, quite a few money-based metrics and economic indicators have raised red flags and pointed to the growing likelihood of a recession in the not-too-distant future. When downturns take shape, it's not uncommon for bank profits to decline as they set aside more capital for loan losses.\n\nHowever, the economic cycle is a two-way street that undeniably favors the patient. In the 78-plus years since World War II ended, nine of the 12 U.S. recessions resolved in under a year. Meanwhile, the remaining three failed to surpass 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth have lasted multiple years. Disproportionately long periods of expansion allow banks to steadily grow their loan portfolios and generate higher profits over the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat makes BofA ideally suited for investors' portfolios right now is its interest rate sensitivity. Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has increased its federal funds rate at the fastest pace in four decades. When interest rates rise, lending institutions almost always benefit by collecting more net-interest income from outstanding variable-rate loans. No U.S. money-center bank is better positioned to benefit from higher interest rates than Bank of America. The Fed's hawkish stance has added billions of dollars in net-interest income each quarter to its bottom line.\n\nAs I've previously pointed out, Bank of America's digitization initiatives are paying dividends, too. Although BofA certainly isn't the first name that comes to mind when you think of financial technology (fintech) investments, the company's efforts to encourage digital banking have worked. As of the end of 2023, 75% of its consumer households were banking digitally, and nearly half of all loan sales were completed online or via mobile app. These digital transactions are considerably cheaper for the company than in-person interactions, and they'll help improve BofA's operating efficiency over time.\n\nBank of America's valuation is also enticing. Shares can be picked up right now for roughly 10 times Wall Street's consensus earnings in 2025, and for just a shade above its listed book value, as of Dec. 31, 2023. High-quality banks trading for right around their book values are often steals.\n\nAlibaba\n\nA second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought by opportunistic investors with $300 right now is none other than China's leading e-commerce company Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nThe biggest concern with China stocks for the moment is that recent economic data has disappointed. China's economy has traditionally grown at a superior pace to most developed markets. A subpar growth rate, coupled with the heightened (and occasionally unpredictable) oversight of Chinese regulators, can make China-based stocks riskier investments.\n\nThe counter to the above argument is that Chinese regulators were guided by a very strict COVID-19 mitigation strategy for three years, which led to extended and unpredictable lockdowns that crippled supply chains and consumer/enterprise buying power. Although China ended this controversial practice in December 2022, it's going to take time for China's economy to regain its luster. Once it finds its footing, China's economy can outpace most developed countries in the growth department.\n\nTo add to the above, China's emerging middle class should help sustain double-digit growth for online retail sales in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Based on estimates from the International Trade Administration in April 2023, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall combined for a nearly 51% share of e-commerce in China.\n\nBeyond what should be steady e-commerce growth, Alibaba is also the clear leader in cloud infrastructure service spending in mainland China. Tech-analysis firm Canalys estimated this past June that Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the $7.7 billion in enterprise cloud infrastructure spending in China during the first quarter of 2023. The margins associated with cloud services are considerably higher than those for online retail sales, which means this segment could be the company's core cash-flow driver throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nLastly, Alibaba is cheap and absolutely swimming in cash. It ended last year with nearly $92 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment and other treasury investments, and its board has authorized in excess of $35 billion for share buybacks. Excluding its cash, Alibaba is valued at less than 5 times forward-year earnings, which represents a potentially generational buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nThe third no-brainer stock long-term investors can confidently buy with $300 right now is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ), which is best-known by its shorthand, \"J&J.\"\n\nThe reason J&J has lagged the iconic Dow and S&P 500 in the return column over the past two years is because of the uncertainty of outstanding litigation regarding its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder. Around 100,000 lawsuits allege that J&J's baby powder causes cancer. Though the company has attempted to settle this litigation on two separate occasions, both offers were thrown out in court. As a general rule, Wall Street dislikes financial uncertainty.\n\nOn the other hand, Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies that Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of S&P Global, has anointed with its highest possible credit rating (AAA). Thanks to J&J's cash-rich balance sheet and its highly predictable annual cash flow, S&P has the utmost confidence that the company can service its debt obligations and eventually put this matter in the back seat.\n\nWhat really makes Johnson & Johnson tick is the company's pharmaceutical segment. Even though its medical technologies division is well-positioned to grow as the U.S. and global population ages, the company's decisive shift to generate more of its sales from brand-name drugs has helped lift its adjusted operating earnings almost every year over the past four decades. Novel therapies offer high margins and provide J&J with exceptional drug-pricing power.\n\nAnother under-the-radar key to Johnson & Johnson's long-term success has been its consistency in key leadership positions. J&J's CEOs have historically stuck around for a decade, or longer. Continuity at the top has helped J&J's operating growth stay on track.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that Johnson & Johnson stock is historically inexpensive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6 represents a nearly 10% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period. As a bonus, the company has increased its base annual dividend for 61 consecutive years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bank of America wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Finding the next multi-bagger investment isn\u2019t as easy as staking all your cash on a Fabulous Four stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or playing it safe by index investing. Instead, the key to long-term, massive gains is finding speculative stocks with potential that the market is overlooking.\n\nIn a nutshell, you\u2019re like an investor buying into Nvidia in 2013 when shares traded in penny stock territory: you have a vision of the future and have found a speculative stock that fits that vision. More importantly, you have the conviction to wait out turbulence with massive gains on the horizon.\n\nWhile these stocks may not be the next Nvidia, each is cornering an important and emerging market with massive potential. As early movers in their respective spaces, these speculative stocks remain under the radar \u2014 for now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBraze (BRZE) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nManaging marketing in today\u2019s digital creator economy is tough when you consider the many platforms, customer expectations across channels, and sheer scope of a well-integrated marketing campaign. Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) is a speculative stock that helps customers better manage marketing efforts. Shockingly, most investors don\u2019t have this mid-cap speculative stock on their radar even though it boasts mega-clients like Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), NASCAR and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).\n\nIn a nutshell, Braze leverages user data to better personalize advertising across platforms. It creates a coherent thread for the potential customer while helping the advertiser track spending and return on ad sales more efficiently. Braze is also one of the few companies effectively using customer-facing artificial intelligence (AI) integration tools. That\u2019s in contrast to companies slapping an \u201cAI\u201d label on anything and everything with a hint of automation, whether or not the label is appropriate.\n\nA newer company expanding as rapidly as possible, Braze isn\u2019t yet turning a profit. But the company\u2019s strong revenue growth, high subscription revenue rate (95%) and a notable client book prove this speculative stock has a bright future. Even if it remains under the radar for now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe \u201cInternet of Things\u201d is a well-known trope by now, but for many the phrase conjures up thoughts of connected refrigerators and home alarm systems. While valid, those are just a slice of the overall IoT sector. However, speculative stock Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is scaling the concept to serve enterprise and industrial operations more effectively. Samsara primarily targets fleet, transportation and heavy equipment to manage operational workflows, track movement and improve overall safety.\n\nSamsara just marked a record-setting year in its most recent report, nailing 39% year-over-year (YoY) recurring revenue growth. Recurring customer counts climbed 49% and brought in a respectable $27 million in free cash flow. Most importantly, Samsara is a relatively new firm bringing an equally nascent tech to market. It means the firm\u2019s upward possibilities are endless as they increase market penetration and begin scaling to meet growing clients by targeting the bigger fish currently just out of their reach.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) ecommerce company nogin, NOGN stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-consumer e-commerce is as popular as ever post-pandemic, with giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) leading the way. GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) operates similarly but carves out its niche by focusing on the vast B2B market. It aims to be the ultimate platform for businesses to source products and handle all related vendor, product and sourcing management tasks.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing and payment processing. GigaCloud provides a comprehensive suite of services tailored for the scaled B2B e-commerce market, including a vibrant vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment and notably, secure cross-border payment facilitation.\n\nThe company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio stands out for its low value, at just 19x, starkly contrasting with the tech sector\u2019s average ratio of 36x. This disparity becomes even more pronounced when considering GigaCloud\u2019s earnings growth, which saw earnings per share double over the past four quarters. Moreover, the company maintains robust free cash flow per share and trades at an exceptionally low 0.68x sales, highlighting its status as a highly undervalued speculative stock in today\u2019s market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in BRZE.

        "title": "Why China Stocks Alibaba, JD.com, and PDD Holdings Were Climbing Today",
        "content": "Shares of Chinese stocks were rallying today after an annual parliamentary meeting came to a close and China posted some promising economic data. Beijing also announced another round of support for the economy, which investors hope will revive struggling Chinese stocks.\n\nInvestors seemed encouraged by an improvement in the consumer price index, which was up 0.7% in February, showing increased demand during the key Lunar New Year holiday season. The producer price index, however, continued to fall. Investors have been concerned about deflation as consumer spending has been weak in the world's #2 economy, so rising consumer prices is a good sign.\n\nInvestors also seemed to like Beijing's plans to support the economic recovery and its target of 5% economic growth for the year.\n\nIt will still be an uphill climb for China stock investors, but shares of top Chinese tech stocks have fallen so far that it won't take much to give them a lift. As a result, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) was up 2% as of 3:30 p.m. ET; JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) had gained 5.5%; and Pinduoduo parent PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) rose 1.8% on the news. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChina has a big hole to climb out of\n\nChinese stocks have largely fallen over the last three years after Beijing started cracking down on the tech sector. This followed disrespectful comments from Alibaba Founder Jack Ma toward Chinese finance officials.\n\nThe crackdown, a strict Covid lockdown, and a weak economic recovery have contributed to disappointing returns. Stocks like Alibaba and JD have fallen far enough that they trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 10 as their former growth rates shrunk, though that's made it easier for these stocks to climb on any sign of an improving economic outlook coming out of China.\n\nAlibaba is coming off another quarter of underwhelming growth with revenue rising just 5%. The company said back in November that it would abandon its plan to spin off its cloud-computing unit due to the impact of chip-export restrictions from the U.S. Alibaba's core e-commerce business has also struggled in the face of a weak consumer and competition from Pinduoduo as price competition has intensified. Revenue from Taobao and Tmall rose just 2% in the quarter, though support from Beijing could help that accelerate. Investors are also hopeful that new CEO Eddie Wu can help turn around the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD has faced similar headwinds, and its stock has fallen even further than Alibaba's. In its earnings report last week, the stock jumped as it reported a mild acceleration in revenue growth to 3.6%, and it announced a $3 billion share-buyback program. The company is getting more aggressive in response to demands from Founder Richard Liu by moving into cheaper items and doing more discounting. Investors seem to like the strategy, but the financial results are still likely to underwhelm in the near term.\n\nFinally, PDD Holdings has been the exception in the Chinese e-commerce sector, but the stock trades in response to economic data. PDD has benefited from the rapid growth of its social commerce marketplace Pinduoduo in China and Temu, the bargain-priced e-commerce site rapidly growing in international markets. PDD hasn't reported fourth-quarter earnings yet, but its revenue jumped 94%, showing it's clearly outperforming its two peers above. It's also delivered strong growth on the bottom line, making it more attractive than the slow-growth China stocks.\n\nWill Chinese stocks recover?\n\nChinese stocks have been volatile this year, swinging up and down on economic data and related news. Beijing is clearly interested in reviving the Chinese stock market, but it will take more than interest to drive an extended comeback in the sector.\n\nFor now, the Chinese economy still seems to be struggling, and the intense competition in e-commerce will lead to winners and losers. Until Alibaba and JD show they can deliver significant growth again, PDD seems like the safest bet of the three stocks above.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Can Ride the AI Cloud Boom to New Heights",
        "content": "An article in the Wall Street Journal from July 2023 indicated that the AI Cloud boom has created significant opportunities for multiple firms in their stocks. The thrust of the article was that Cloud providers largely remained incapable of supporting large AI applications. Even the hyper-scale firms that populate Silicon Valley and its equivalents globally were not considered ready.\n\nThe opportunity continues in 2024: Infrastructure wasn\u2019t designed to run the large complex systems required in AI or to handle such complex calculations. In short, there is as big an opportunity today as there was when the Wall Street Journal ran that article nine months ago.\n\nThe majority of the opportunity lies in North America where AI has grown quickest. However, the opportunity is global in scale. Let\u2019s take a look at seven companies that are poised to continue to ride the AI Cloud boom to new heights.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s begin with Alibaba, (NYSE:BABA) a stock representing the Chinese firm and a market outside of North America. The Chinese market differs from the American market in material ways. That means AI applications also differ.\n\nFor example, one of the more prominent applications of AI that is positively affecting Alibaba is in relation to e-commerce. Firms throughout China tapped Alibaba\u2019s large language model to substantially increase sales on the November 11 shopping event known as Single\u2019s Day.\n\nAlibaba also cited strong results on Single\u2019s Day in its earnings release from early February. And while those results were positive, Alibaba is also reflective of the broader Chinese economy which\u00a0continues to face substantial issues. The result is that Alibaba\u2019s revenues are essentially flat. Revenues increased by 5% during the period with Cloud revenues growing similarly at 3%. To be clear, that is not acceptable for the firm and led to substantial decreases in net income.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, that is not the point here. Instead, the point is that Alibaba is among preeminent Cloud providers in China. That positions the company to rebound strongly and is one of the primary reasons that the stock has so much upside at the moment. One reason to believe in that narrative is simply that Alibaba has cut prices on its AI Cloud offering in an effort to spur demand.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) still has a chance to ride the AI Cloud boom higher even though it continues to fumble the opportunity. The stock has dropped dramatically over the past month as the company continues to scramble to catch up.\n\nThere is an ongoing arms race in the AI sector and Alphabet has been behind since day one. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) jumped far ahead of Alphabet in early 2023 when it announced its investment in ChatGPT. It really hasn\u2019t relented since. That has left Google wondering what it can do and taking risks in order to make up ground. The results haven\u2019t been very good frankly. The company is currently facing a firestorm over controversial AI generated images. That is only making its troubles worse.\n\nThe sell-off is an opportunity. January earnings were stronger than expected and rate cuts later this year will propel Tech again into the limelight. Take the bad news as good news for contrarian investors and act.\n\nAlteryx (AYX) The Alteryx (AYX) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlteryx (NYSE:AYX) isn\u2019t a household stock name nor is it among the best known firms in relation to the AI cloud boom.\u00a0 Instead, it is an analytics automation business with a legitimate chance to further establish itself with enterprise customers.That\u2019s particularly important at the moment as many enterprise customers continue to question the value of their previous investments in the AI cloud.\n\nAlteryx is investing in that opportunity. The company recently announced an expanded partnership with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. Those new integrations are expected to\u00a0decrease the time for users to generate AI driven enterprise use cases. Such use cases are a major target area for AI cloud development; it will only increase the speed at which data is produced which will further increase the need for analytics with which to draw actionable insight.\n\nThe expanded partnership has the potential to increase revenues at Alteryx which already was performing strongly. During 2023 sales increased by 13% at the company.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has gone from a company that is highly government-oriented to one that is more commercially oriented of late. The company is again leveraging its government\u00a0connections and relationships, propelling its stock higher.\n\nPalanitr first established a name as an analytics firm with a more conservative bent. It was highly connected to the government and the defense sector in particular. Then the company continued to grow and ultimately reached profitability which helped to catapult its stock much higher. A big part of that was its AI cloud offerings.\n\nIt was suddenly a more commercially oriented firm. That\u2019s where it stood when the company last released earnings in early February. Commercial revenues grew by 70% during the fourth quarter.\u00a0 They were catching up to government revenues.\n\nGovernment revenues are surging again though, as the company just landed a $178 million contract for the Army\u2019s project Titan. It will leverage Palantir\u2019s AI for its battlefield systems. That could propel Palantir stock higher again and is a reason to believe in its continued strength as the AI Cloud continues to develop.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is essentially a picks and shovels stock in relation to the AI cloud. The company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven indispensable within the\u00a0leading cloud companies that provide AI services broadly.\n\nThose GPUs are sold as stand-alone chips and are also sold in combination with a CPU, both of which are used to power the AI cloud. Those chips are known for their parallel processing capability and have been in use for AI for roughly a dozen years.\n\nAgain, it is Nvidia\u2019s GPUs that are far and away in highest demand. That demand is producing incredible sales growth. Nvidia expects $24 billion in revenues in the current quarter. If it reaches that goal it would represent a tripling of sales over the same 12 months prior.\n\nInvestor apprehension is logical given that Nvidia shares traded for roughly $150 in early 2023 and rose to more than $800 by early 2024. Yet, when one considers that revenues are probably going to triple this quarter it is also entirely logical that Nvidia shares are expected to rise as high as $1,400.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) represents Nvidia\u2019s strongest competition. That is the clearest reason to buy the stock as AI cloud applications continue to develop.\n\nWhile Nvidia clearly has the most in demand chips\u00a0for AI application, their continued dominance isn\u2019t assured. For one, buyers are very clearly seeking alternatives due to high prices for Nvidia chips. Both MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft recently stated that they would switch to AMD\u2019s chips. It is very much worth noting that they buy roughly 60% of all of the chips that Nvidia sold recently.\n\nIt remains clear that AMD will have legitimate opportunities to serve firms like Meta Platforms and Microsoft moving forward. That is a strong catalyst that has propelled AMD shares above $200 recently.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD is also targeting the Chinese market which continues to face strong export restrictions from the United States. There is an opportunity there yet AMD will have to weaken the chips that it intends to sell in the country.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)\u00a0is another stock to consider in connection to both the country and the ongoing AI cloud opportunity.\n\nBaidu is analogous to the Google of China and provides many similar services. In other words, it is deeply connected to all things internet and artificial intelligence within the country.\n\nThe good news is that Baidu has done better than some other large leading Chinese tech firms on a top line basis. In 2023, revenues grew by 9%. Alibaba, for example, as discussed above, saw its revenues increase by a more modest 5% during the same period.\n\nThe company did not provide a strict break out of cloud AI revenues. However, it did mention that much of its growth during the period was attributable to Cloud AI investments. Baidu represents a contrarian investment that leverages the combined power of a Chinese economic rebound and Cloud AI investment. So, as with Alibaba, there is a lot of future potential in the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Starting April 1, staff get \u201clong-term cash\u201d in addition to stock options. Those instruments will also vest once a quarter instead of only once a year, according to the memo.

This article will focus on recent industry trends and the major players in the retail industry. If you want to skip our analysis, you can proceed to the section highlighting the 5 Largest Retailers in the U.S. and the World in 2024.\n\nAn Analysis of the Retail Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global retail market was valued at $28.84 trillion in 2023, The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.1% and is forecasted to reach $42.75 trillion by the end of 2028. The demand for supermarkets, hypermarkets, discount stores, and out-of-town retail parks is also on the rise. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific was the largest and fastest-growing region in the retail market due to its continued population and economic growth. Meanwhile, North America was the second-largest region in the retail market. Its saturated market stabilizes the global retail industry. The leading demand segments within the retail industry include pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, electronics and household appliances, furniture, and toys.\n\nAccording to an article by Deloitte, there are several key trends shaping the retail industry in 2024. These include the shift towards demand-driven retail, which focuses on catering to diverse consumer groups, and a trend towards hybrid retail which blends digital and physical channels to enhance consumer experiences. Additionally, companies are optimizing operations through supply chain automation and are utilizing robotics and artificial intelligence to automate their operations. Moreover, companies are also leveraging blockchain technology to improve the transparency of their supply chain operations.\n\nHowever, the global retail industry is currently facing challenges due to ongoing geopolitical conflicts. The Red Sea, which serves as the gateway to the southern entry of the Suez Canal, is one of the world's vital and heavily trafficked maritime routes. According to statistics by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, around 12% of international trade passes through the Suez Canal, accounting for 30% of global container traffic and exceeding $1 trillion in goods annually. The canal reduces the maritime distance between Asia and Europe almost by half. The recent Middle East conflict has disrupted access to vital waterways due to Houthi rebel attacks on ships in the Red Sea. According to a report by Kiel Trade, the Red Sea's container shipment volume dropped to about 200,000 containers per day in December 2023, down from 500,0000 containers per day in November 2023, marking a 66% decline from the expected volume based on 2017 to 2019 data.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Players in the Retail Industry\n\nSome of the largest players in the retail industry include Walmart Inc.

        "content": "Stock picking has long been thought of as an art, but the savvy investor knows that there is also plenty of science to it. And for those willing to embrace the science, TipRanks has the Smart Score, an AI-driven data sorting tool, based on sophisticated natural language algorithms.\n\nThe tool gathers the reams of data thrown up by the stock markets \u2013 the transactions, the stock movements, the traders\u2019 moves, all of it. The result is distilled down to a simple, easily readable score, a single number on a scale of 1 to 10, showing investors at a glance the likely trajectory for any stock. And the \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 stocks are the shares that clearly deserve closer scrutiny.\n\nRight now, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) are setting the pace, boasting the highest Smart Score among large-cap stocks on the \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 list. Let\u2019s see what it is about these names that makes them stand out from the pack.\n\nAmazon\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Amazon, a company that needs little introduction. This survivor of the original dot-com bubble has expanded from its origin as an online bookseller to become the world\u2019s largest online retailer, dealing in anything and everything \u2013 and in the process, also becoming the world\u2019s fourth-largest publicly traded firm, with a market cap of $1.8 trillion and approximately $1.4 billion in daily sales.\n\nAmazon has complemented its mega-cap size and near-endless online retail offerings with a huge brick-and-mortar infrastructure and rapid delivery guarantees. The company has a global network of warehouses and fulfillment centers, with some facilities totaling more than 1 million square feet of storage and workspace. The company can deliver customer orders around the world, and in many locations can offer next-day delivery. As an online retailer, Amazon depends on its website, which is one of the internet\u2019s most trafficked \u2013 receiving well over 2 billion site visits every month.\n\nThat\u2019s just Amazon\u2019s eCommerce business. eCommerce is the core of the company, but Amazon is branching out, working to diversify the products it offers to ensure that it can meet customer needs in an ever-changing world. The company has a popular cloud computing service, AWS, available by subscription, that has become an important source of revenue. In addition, Amazon offers its customers such widely varied services as online gaming for both kids and adults; home automation; TV streaming; ebooks via the Kindle reader; and even grocery deliveries \u2013 the full list of services encompasses these, and many more. The common denominator is putting online retail and subscription models to work in the real world, and in people\u2019s daily lives.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat this comes down to for investors is simple: $170 billion in revenue reported in the last quarter, 4Q23. That represented a near-14% increase from the prior-year period, and was $3.74 billion better than had been anticipated. The company\u2019s bottom line, the firm\u2019s $1 EPS, was derived from a net income of $10.6 billion. AWS proved to be an important driver in the quarterly gains, generating $24.2 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year.\n\nFor 2023 as a whole, Amazon brought in $574.8 billion in total revenue. Net income for the year came to $30.4 billion, or $2.90 per diluted share. The company boasted a free cash flow of $36.8 billion for 2023, contrasted with a cash burn of $11.6 billion in the prior year.\n\nFor Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz, the key point here is Amazon\u2019s proven ability to continue generating income growth \u2013 even on top of its already fast pace. He writes of the company, \u201cDespite outperforming the market by ~60 points over the last year, Amazon remains one of our top picks in our coverage, due to the increasingly compelling operating income growth that the company is slated to deliver in the coming years\u2026 Given our constructive outlook on the shape of advertising operating income in the coming years, we raise our 24/25 OI estimates by 10/8%, respectively, and take our price target higher to $210. We continue to believe that GAAP earnings valuation for Amazon screens increasingly compelling\u2026\u201d\n\nThis adds up to a Buy rating, of course, and the $210 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of nearly 20%. (To watch Horowitz\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis tech and retail mega-cap stock has picked up no fewer than 41 analyst reviews in recent weeks \u2013 and they are all positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating on the shares. AMZN is selling for $175.35, and its $208.48 average target price implies a gain of almost 19% on the one-year horizon. (See AMZN stock analysis)\n\nAlibaba Holdings\n\nNext up is Alibaba, another giant of the online retail industry \u2013 and the company that some call \u2018China\u2019s Amazon.\u2019 Founded by Chinese tech entrepreneur and billionaire Jack Ma, and based in Hangzhou, the company has been in business since 1999. Alibaba started out as the main online retailer focusing on China\u2019s domestic market and is still the dominant eCommerce player in this country of 1.4 billion people. Alibaba has branched out to the global online marketplace, but China remains the core of its business.\n\nThat business core is solid. Alibaba boasts that it can deliver just about any product, to just about any buyer, to just about any location in China \u2013 and can guarantee next-day or 2-day delivery. On the global eCommerce scene, Alibaba lists some 200 million-plus products available, across 5,900 product categories, coming from over 200,000 suppliers with delivery to more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nIn addition to online retail, both in China and abroad, Alibaba, like Amazon, is branching out into other areas. The company has its hands in several pots, including cloud services and digital media. Retail, however, still makes up the bulk of the company\u2019s business; in fiscal year 2022, the company brought in 67% of its revenue from the Chinese retail sector, with another 5% from international commerce.\n\nIn the last reported quarter ending December 31, Alibaba posted total revenue of US$36.67 billion, marking a 5% year-over-year increase and surpassing forecasts by $270 million. The eCommerce giant\u2019s earnings, by non-GAAP measures, came to $2.67 per share, or 3 cents per share better than the estimates. The company generated $7.96 billion in free cash flow during the quarter. Despite these successes, shares in BABA are down 5% so far this year, in somewhat volatile trading over the past 2 months.\n\nThe fall in share price has not prevented Truist\u2019s 5-star analyst, Youssef Squali,\u00a0from coming down firmly on the bullish side for BABA stock. He sees Alibaba well positioned to move forward, and lays out four reasons why: \u201c1) compelling valuation (1x EV/Revs and 4.4x EV/AEBITDA), 2) improving order volume growth at Taobao/Tmall fueled by greater focus and investments, 3) strong FCF generation (11% FCF yield) which is fueling a capital return strategy with larger buybacks and dividends; and 4) prospects for a macro recovery as mgmt strengthens its competitive offerings for TTG, Int\u2019l and Cloud. CY24 will be an investment year for BABA which should keep margins in check near-term, that said we believe that much of it is already reflected in the current valuation.\u201d\n\nGoing forward from there, Squali gives BABA stock a Buy rating, and sets a $114 price target that suggests the shares will appreciate by 55% over the course of this year. (To watch Squali\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nAlibaba\u2019s stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 18 recent reviews that include 15 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock is currently priced at $73.55 and its $101.55 average price target implies a 38% upside potential for the next 12 months.

        "content": "Finding the best-kept Wall Street secrets is tough because, well, if it were easy, they wouldn\u2019t be secrets. Today\u2019s top stocks tend to be large-cap tech names with rapid (and arguably unsustainable) growth that frustrates latecomer investors when that momentum slows.\n\nThat\u2019s why, to find the best-kept Wall Street secrets, you need to satisfy two core criteria: identify emerging market opportunities and find small- or medium-cap stocks with great growth stats that target the new sector. These three stocks demonstrate that strong growth while their respective industries\u2014B2B eCommerce, ready-to-drink alcohol, and work-from-home furniture\u2014are just beginning a long and fruitful upward trajectory.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) e-commerce stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe know that globalized, direct-to-purchaser eCommerce will only keep climbing in popularity \u2013 think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) is similar, but as one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets, the eCommerce company targets the massive B2B market to create a one-stop shop for businesses to source products and manage everything that entails.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nProduct and inventory management \u2013 not to mention sourcing and payment processing \u2013 are a tough nut to crack for medium-sized businesses. GigaCloud offers the full suite of scaled B2B eCommerce needs, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and, critically, facilitates cross-border payment safely and securely.\n\nOn its face, the company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is surprisingly low, sitting at just 19x compared to the wider tech sector\u2019s 36 times average ratio. The difference is even starker when you look at GigaCloud\u2019s earnings growth. The company doubled its earnings per share over the past four quarters, with free cash flow per share staying strong\u2014even as, critically, the company trades at just 0.68 times sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nVita Coco Company (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage stocks like Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) remain all the rage, but one competitor\u2014Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO)\u2014remains one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets. While the energy drink markets, and even standard sports drink segments, face steep competition, Vita Coco stands alone among coconut water vendors. The company owns more than half the total addressable market today.\n\nBetter yet, through a strategic partnership with British booze brand Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), Vita Coco is making inroads toward the ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage market with a range of spiked coconut water options. While coconut water mixed with Captain Morgan isn\u2019t my cup of tea, that emerging market is exploding and expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2029\u2014and Vita Coco is set to snag a large portion of that market.\n\nOn the financial front, Vita Coco blew analysts away with an end-of-year 4% earnings beat, driven by a nearly 500% yearly net income increase alongside a 9.4% profit margin. We all know the story of how Monster became one of the century\u2019s top-performing stocks\u2014but this best-kept Wall Street secret may be on its way to doing the same.\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) A staged room with a blue chair in focus.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThough work-from-home trends are weighing on some Wall Street sectors (like commercial real estate), high-end office furniture manufacturer and best-kept Wall Street secret Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) is flourishing in this new environment. The company\u2019s recent dividend increase affirms this success, offering investors 2.88% yield.\n\nSteelcase quickly rebounded from the post-pandemic supply chain shocks and muted corporate furniture spending. Its latest quarterly earnings report revealed a net income of $30.8 million, a significant increase from the previous year\u2019s figures. Meanwhile, the company has maintained steady sales, hovering around $800 million over the last five quarters, indicating that Steelcase has been enhancing its profit margins without compromising on quality.\n\nThe company is actively adjusting its strategy to fit the work-from-home era, aiming for a 5-7% annual increase in sales and targeting a 5% free cash flow margin relative to revenue over the next five years. Additionally, Steelcase has taken decisive steps to reduce its debt amid rising interest rates, bolstering its liquidity and minimizing interest expenses. This strategic financial management positions Steelcase as one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Slashed His Position in Nvidia. Here Are the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "David Tepper amassed a fortune of $20.6 billion by making plenty of smart decisions. Some investors will probably question one of his recent decisions, though. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper sold nearly 23% of his Appaloosa Management hedge fund's position in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIn retrospect, that doesn't appear to be a great move. Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed more than 70% so far in 2024. However, Tepper remains heavily invested in the GPU maker. Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding. He's also still very bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). Here are four AI stocks the billionaire investor bought in Q4.\n\n1. Oracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) ranks as Tepper's biggest new position in Q4. He bought 1.32 million shares of the database and software giant that were worth close to $140 million at the end of 2023.\n\nSince then, Oracle's shares have risen by a single-digit percentage. The company hasn't had any major news to provide a catalyst yet in 2024. That could soon change: Oracle is scheduled to announce its fiscal 2024 third-quarter results on March 11.\n\nIn the meantime, Oracle has been busy bolstering its AI credentials. The company launched its new Oracle cloud infrastructure generative AI service in January. This new service enables Oracle's cloud platform customers to build generative AI apps using large language models from Cohere and Meta Platforms. Oracle is also a major partner with Nvidia's DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service.\n\n2. Alibaba\n\nTepper also loaded up on Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) in Q4. His hedge fund already owned a sizable position in the Chinese tech stock but added another 750,000 shares. That was enough to boost Appaloosa's stake in Alibaba by nearly 21%.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Tepper might like Alibaba right now. The stock is down more than 20% over the last 12 months due in large part to sluggish growth in China. This decline, though, has made Alibaba cheaper than it's been in quite a while with a forward earnings multiple of only 8.1 times.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba has reportedly placed big orders for Nvidia's chips to use with its cloud platform. However, it can't deploy the most advanced GPUs because of U.S. restrictions on exports of AI technology to China.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) retained its No. 3 spot in Appaloosa Management's portfolio at the end of 2023. But it was a bigger position for the hedge fund after Tepper increased his stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant by more than 5.3%. That has turned out to be a great move, with Amazon stock jumping by a double-digit percentage so far in 2024.\n\nWhy does Tepper like Amazon? I suspect two reasons especially stand out. First, the company's profitability and free cash flow are growing robustly. Second, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform should have tremendous growth prospects fueled by the adoption of generative AI.\n\nAs was the case with Oracle and Alibaba, Amazon also has a tight connection with Nvidia. AWS has used Nvidia's GPUs for years. But Amazon is also at least somewhat of a rival to Nvidia as well. The company has developed its own Trainium and Inferentia AI chips that AWS customers can use with their AI apps.\n\n4. Microsoft\n\nTepper also increased his position in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) by nearly 4% in Q4. The massive tech company currently ranks as Appaloosa Management's second-largest holding, making up 11.3% of its portfolio.\n\nMicrosoft has been another solid winner so far this year. AI continues to serve as a major growth driver for the company, which has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its products.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Microsoft is yet another key partner with Nvidia. Among other things, the two companies are working together to connect Nvidia's AI Enterprise software with Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning platform. Like Amazon, though, Microsoft has also developed its own AI chips that could help it reduce its dependence on Nvidia.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "My analysis of Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) indicates strong long-term returns to come for shareholders and the recent full-year results show significant strengths in the short term, too. I estimate, based on the operational value of the company, tied closely with my high expectations of exponential adoption of artificial intelligence within enterprises in the next few decades, that Salesforce will provide significant alpha as an investment over the long term, even amidst reasonable valuation concerns.\n\nFinancial results\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with CRM.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Salesforce released its fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. For the three months ended Jan. 31, on a GAAP basis, it beat the consensus earnings per share estimate for the quarter by 19 cents, reporting $1.47. It also reported fourth-quarter revenue of $9.29 billion, which is 11% year-over-year growth.\n\nThe company also noted full-year revenue of $34.90 billion, up 11% year over year, and full-year operating cash flow of $10.20 billion, up 44% year over year. It initiated a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share of outstanding common stock and announced its share repurchase program authorization increased by $10 billion.\n\nFor 2025, Salesforce issued revenue guidance of $37.7 billion to $38 billion, up 8% to 9% year over year. Its operating margin is expected to rise from 14.40% in 2024 to 20.40% in 2025. It also initiated operating cash flow growth guidance of 21% to 24% year over year.\n\nLong-term operational outlook\n\nI am a long-term investor focused on holding periods of 10 years or more, which I think gives an adequate amount of time for the market to weigh the true value of a company. Technology stocks, in my opinion, are highly subject to speculation and associated volatility as a result. However, over extended holding periods, really exceptional businesses in the technology industry tend to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500 significantly. My research indicates Salesforce is one such company. As such, I will be holding it for a very long time and am comfortable weathering any short-term volatility as a result of a premium valuation as I believe this will get canceled out in decades of growth and market expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nChairman and CEO Marc Benioff said in the recent earnings release:\n\n\"With our trusted, unified Einstein 1 Platform, we're incredibly well positioned to build on our success and capitalize on the massive surge in tech spending expected over the coming years, delivering an unprecedented level of intelligence to our customers as AI transforms every company and industry.\"\n\nSalesforce's Einstein 1 Platform is a comprehensive solution for businesses to improve data aggregation, efficiency and security in operations. It offers open application programming interfaces and an ecosystem of partners on AppExchange. The platform is coding-language-agnostic, which means it supports fully customizable app development in any preferred programming language. Apps can be deployed to connect to almost every data source.\n\nEinstein 1 helps to unify data across an organization, and it offers low-code services to make the synthesis and collaboration of data sets for automation, content generation and predictions easier for users. Additionally, the platform uses its Data Cloud to harmonize data to create a unified view of a single customer, further helping drive personalization, customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. The Einstein Copilot is also a conversational AI assistant that is aimed at improving productivity and assisting users with workflow, including natural language queries.\n\nSalesforce has significant growth and market dominance, which has led it to be considered the top customer relationship management provider for the 10th consecutive year by the International Data Corp.. As of Salesforce's press release in April, the IDC estimated it had a 22.1% market share, compared to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 5.7%, Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) 4.7%, SAP's (NYSE:SAP) 3.8% and Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) 3.5%.\n\nMy research shows Salesforce is the number one investment in AI-assisted business management at this time. As such, I think it will continue to outperform the S&P 500 benchmark significantly over the next decade and beyond. This is further evidenced by a 2023 report by MarketResearch, which estimates the generative AI in CRM market will grow at a compound annual rate of 20.80% from 2023 to 2032.\n\nValue analysis\n\nThere is a significant chance Salesforce stock is slightly overvalued at this time, as illustrated by the GF Value chart. Salesforce's Full-Year Results Strengthen Its Long-Term Outlook\n\nHowever, as far as technology companies go, I estimate Salesforce is still selling at a tolerable valuation. I bought my stake earlier in the year when the GF Value chart indicated a fair valuation. However, as with most technology stocks, I do expect bouts of short-term volatility as a result of valuation and potential future earnings misses. However, I estimate this will be significantly counterbalanced by high growth over the long term.\n\nThe company's trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio is approximately 114, but its forward price-earnings ratio comes down to a much more attractive 31. Additionally, its price-earnings ratio without non-recurring items is 45. Therefore, I do not think this is the worst time to buy the stock. Indeed, the valuation could be better, but over the long term, any short-term depreciation could be relatively irrelevant. Compared to competitors, Salesforce's forward price-earnings ratio of 31 looks reasonable, considering Microsoft's ratio of 35, Oracle's ratio of 18, SAP's ratio of 38 and Adobe's ratio of 31.\n\nGlobal growth risk\n\nAt this time, Salesforce has a highly Westernized customer base, with 63% of its operating revenue coming from the United States and 22.8% coming from Europe. With only 9.4% coming from Asia Pacific, there is some risk the company may be outcompeted by Chinese companies in the Asian markets. For example, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has a significant stake in the CRM and cloud computing markets. Still, Salesforce has strategically partnered with Alibaba, giving it the exclusive rights to offer its suite of services in China. However, this does not stop new startups in China from potentially innovating and capturing a market that is relatively small for Salesforce in comparison to its American presence.\n\nConclusion\n\nI expect to increase my stake in Salesforce over time, and I consider it an exceptional business with a relatively wide moat in AI CRM. I believe its growth over the next several decades could far exceed other technology peers as I estimate that we are at the advent of an exponential increase in the adoption of AI in workplaces, which should have a positive feedback loop effect to come. My analyst rating for the stock at the moment is a buy, and it would be a strong buy if the price were slightly more favorable.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

It green-lit a new three-year buyback program, aiming to assuage investors concerned about the Chinese e-commerce player\u2019s growth potential. The amount matched the Beijing-based company\u2019s previous program. Its shares rose 11% in pre-market trading in New York.\n\nJD.com\u2019s results come after calls from billionaire founder Richard Liu in December to fix deep-seated issues from poor merchant support to an overly pricey item list. The company, which traditionally focused on big-ticket items such as electronics, has since last year wielded discounts and added cheaper products to tap bargain-hunting during China\u2019s economic downturn.\n\nThe Beijing-based company had adopted discounts to try and revive topline growth, which has remained mired in single-digits for about a year as China struggles with an uncertain post-Covid recovery.

This probably was a result of JD.com\u2019s enlarged selection of value-for-money merchandise and services, which attracted more orders and reduced processing costs per unit, fueling stronger-than-expected gains in operating efficiency. A persistent rise in the number of paying JD Plus members and their contribution via fees to the company likely also helped narrow the year-over-year fall in 4Q retail operating profit.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nThat battle has expanded beyond online shopping. Last week, JD.com slashed the fees it charges for cloud services in response to deep cuts from Alibaba, a move that could erode margins at both their internet computing arms.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if JD.com can galvanize its businesses at a time China\u2019s grappling with several major issues, including an unfolding property crisis and stubborn deflation. Economic data, including retail sales, have disappointed in recent months.

The fundraise remains in progress but Alibaba and HongShan, formerly Sequoia China, have committed to the financing, one of the people said, asking not to be identified talking about a private deal.

        "content": "If you bought shares of Meta Platforms in late 2022, you could have more than doubled, possibly tripled, your investment. Buying a solid stock when the markets are overly bearish on it can prove to be an excellent move in the long run. In Meta's case, the recovery happened incredibly quickly.\n\nOne stock that could have the potential to generate similar returns is Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA). The tech stock has been struggling in recent years as investors have grown concerned about the impact the Chinese government has on the business -- it has a stake in over a dozen of Alibaba's entities.\n\nWhile it's a risk investors shouldn't gloss over, it's also hard to underestimate the size and prominence of Alibaba in the Chinese tech and e-commerce markets, and its attractive long-term growth prospects. Here's a closer look at why this stock could be worth taking a chance on today.\n\nAlibaba's business is diverse and there's more growth on the horizon\n\nA big concern about Alibaba's business lately was its lack of growth. There has been an increase in competition in the Chinese e-commerce market as the emergence of shopping platform Temu, which PDD Holdings owns, has put pressure on retailers all over the world who are competing with its low-priced items. But even amid those challenges, Alibaba's business was fairly resilient.\n\nIn the company's most recent earnings report, for the last three months of 2023, revenue from online shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall rose by 2%. And while e-commerce is Alibaba's core business, the company's overall operations are diverse, and that is what helps make this a great investment.\n\nFor example, Alibaba's cloud intelligence group accounts for more than 10% of segmented revenue and its Cainiao Smart Logistics Network isn't far behind either, representing just under 9% of sales this past quarter.\n\nWhile Alibaba has faced headwinds due to a slowing Chinese economy, there's still plenty of growth potential ahead. Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai believes that the level of e-commerce penetration in China will grow to more than 40% over the next five years; currently it's around 30%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba has the benefit of already being a large, established player in the Chinese e-commerce market, which can put it in an excellent position to benefit from more growth in the sector.\n\nThe stock's valuation is incredibly attractive\n\nIn 2022, amid a sharp sell-off, Meta's stock fell so much that at one point its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple was barely above 8. Today, the stock trades at more than 32 times its profits. Alibaba's stock, however, remains discounted, with a P/E ratio of just under 14. Over the past 12 months, shares of Alibaba are down 15% and it's possible the stock can fall even further, depending on how relations between China and the U.S. progress, and how strong the Chinese market proves to be.\n\nInvestors are getting the stock at a discount because of these unknowns and the geopolitical risk that comes with an investment in Alibaba. But for such a large tech player in the international and Chinese e-commerce markets, there's a lot of value here.\n\nShould you invest in Alibaba stock?\n\nAlibaba looks like a great buy at its current valuation and it has the potential to be one of the better growth stocks to buy right now. The Chinese market isn't done growing and while the Chinese government's influence on the company is a concern, it shouldn't be enough of a worry to deter long-term investors.\n\nThe potential upside for Alibaba's stock could be significant. It was trading at around $200 in 2020 and in the long run, it wouldn't be surprising for it to get back to those levels again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe management reshuffle is the latest step by Alibaba to promote a new generation of younger managers following a call by Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu Yongming to \"rejuvenate the team\" in an internal letter in September, when he took over as CEO.\n\nWu said in that letter that in four years time the company's core management would be made up of millennials.\n\nLast December Taobao and Tmall Group, Alibaba's bread-and-butter e-commerce business, appointed six new executives to \"create a culture of innovation that will foster our new generation of talent \".\n\nUnder Yu, LSG achieved steady growth in recent quarters.

JD.com, a rival in e-commerce and cloud services, responded later the same day with its own round of price cuts, unveiled on the company\u2019s WeChat account. Alibaba\u2019s stock fell as much as 1.9%, while JD was little changed.\n\nThe moves by Alibaba mark one of its more aggressive bids to fend off competition from the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu Inc. and JD.com.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 countries with most Chinese expats. If you do not want to learn about the dynamics of Chinese expatriation, head straight to the 5 Countries with Most Chinese Expats.\n\nWhen examining the global diaspora of Chinese nationals, certain countries like the USA and Thailand stand out as hubs for expatriates seeking opportunities abroad. These destinations attract Chinese expats for economic reasons and offer cultural, educational, and lifestyle opportunities. From bustling metropolises to serene landscapes, these countries provide diverse environments for Chinese expats to thrive and contribute to their host societies while maintaining ties with their homeland.\n\nExploring the Dynamics of the Chinese Immigration Market: Opportunities, Trends, and Impact\n\nThe global expat market, particularly the Chinese immigration market, presents significant economic opportunities for Chinese expats. Chinese immigrants are dispersed across various countries, with notable populations in Indonesia, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and Singapore. The Chinese diaspora amounts to 39.5 million individuals spread across 130 countries. Regarding financial statistics, China gradually opened to restricted forms of movement from abroad in 2022, with 4.47 million foreigners entering and exiting China that year. Notably, in 2022, 477,000 residence permits were issued to foreigners coming to China for various purposes such as work, family reunions, private affairs, and study.\n\nChinese immigrants in the United States are highly educated and often employed in management positions. They tend to obtain lawful permanent residence through work and have been a significant group among new green card holders in recent years. The United States is a top destination for Chinese immigrants globally. Additionally, China is the primary source of international students enrolled in U.S. higher education and received many employer-sponsored H-1B temporary visas in the fiscal year 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen it comes to immigration statistics for China, the number of immigrants has increased. For instance, in 2015, there were 978,046 immigrants in China, showing a 15.08% increase from 2010. These figures highlight the growing immigration trend both into and out of China.\n\nNavigating the Dynamics of Chinese Expatriation and Economic Impact: Trends, Challenges, and Strategies\n\nThe outmigration of Chinese citizens has significantly impacted economic growth in China and globally, and the early 21st century witnessed a surge in overseas Chinese returning to China, driven by the country's robust economy and abundant opportunities at home. This trend was further fueled by various government initiatives to attract overseas Chinese talent, such as the Thousand Talents Programme, which fostered entrepreneurship and innovation. Consequently, Chinese returnees have played a pivotal role in starting high-tech enterprises, introducing new management concepts, and revitalizing traditional industries, contributing significantly to China's economic development.\n\nChina's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 marked a turning point, leading to significant economic reforms that reshaped migration patterns. The boost in export-led manufacturing and domestic demand altered the landscape of emigration, with labor shortages no longer driving international migration. Instead, the allure of new opportunities within China led to increased diversification of emigration as more citizens obtained passports. Chinese emigrants have also facilitated global capital investments through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, impacting various industries globally.\n\nStudies indicate migration can have positive economic effects, including higher growth and productivity. For instance, a 1% increase in the migrant share in the adult population can result in a 2% higher GDP in the long run. Despite posing challenges such as social tensions, migration offers economic gains through increased productivity and labor market integration, benefiting both host and origin countries.\n\nHowever, China faces economic challenges stemming from demographic shifts and COVID-related disruptions. The country experienced a population decline in 2022, signaling demographic challenges that impact economic growth. With a shrinking labor force, China must focus on productivity to sustain its economy. Moreover, the economic growth rate dropped to 3% in 2022 due to COVID-related disruptions, marking a significant decline from previous years. To address these challenges, China aims to boost quality GDP growth through policy adjustments.\n\nThe trends in Chinese expatriation are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, government policies, and societal changes. Understanding future trends in Chinese expatriation requires analyzing financial statistics and overseas development finance patterns.\n\nChinese overseas development finance has seen a downward trend in recent years, with a decrease in large-scale lending levels. This decline is evident in the number of new loan commitments totaling $10.5 billion in 2020 and 2021, the lowest in recent years. China's development finance is concentrated among top borrowers such as Angola, Argentina, and Brazil, mainly focusing on extraction, transport, and power.\n\nChina's financial system faces challenges, including financial repression and innovation constraints, which contribute to stagnant productivity growth. As seen in recent central financial work conferences, efforts to address these challenges include discussions emphasizing financial stability, risk management, and innovation support. China is also adapting its monetary and fiscal policies to support quality growth and structural reform amidst global economic challenges, focusing on upgrading the equity market to finance innovation and improve efficiency.\n\nTech Talent Dilemma: Returning Professionals Grapple with China's Work Culture\n\nChinese professionals returning to China after studying abroad encounter challenges related to work culture, work-life balance, and job opportunities. Despite efforts to attract tech talent amid a tech war with the US, many overseas Chinese tech workers are deterred by the intense work environment and lack of work-life balance in Chinese companies, influenced significantly by differences in work cultures between China and countries like the US. Some returning tech workers have faced layoffs and increased competition, especially in major tech firms like Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Tencent, contributing to concerns about youth unemployment rates in urban areas.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), a leading Chinese tech giant, contributes significantly to China's development with a $15.5 billion pledge by 2025 for innovation and economic support. However, concerns arise over its $2.5 million US lobbying expenditure and international expansion focusing on platforms like AliExpress. With Eddie Wu taking over as CEO in 2023, leadership changes reflect a strategic shift towards cloud intelligence amidst competitive markets, aiming to sustain Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)'s global tech leadership.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), a major Chinese tech company founded by Robin Li in 2000, has significantly advanced China's technological landscape. With an 80% market share in China's search engine market and ranking as the world's fourth most popular website, Baidu has showcased China's tech capabilities globally. Its key contributions include technological innovation with a search engine rivaling Google, market dominance shaping information access in China, and strong brand recognition domestically and internationally.\n\nFinancially, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has experienced substantial growth, with total revenues and net income growing at high compound annual rates from 2008 to 2012, alongside steady growth in shareholders' equity. Fitch Ratings affirmed Baidu's 'A' rating with a stable outlook, highlighting its strong market position and robust cash generation from search and newsfeed services.\n\nTencent, a prominent Chinese tech company, has committed significant resources to philanthropy, pledging US$7.7 billion for 'shared prosperity' initiatives. Despite challenges, it remains a leader in digital donations in China. Financially, Tencent reported strong growth in Q2 2023, with revenues up 11% year-on-year to RMB149 billion ($20.6 billion) and net profits reaching RMB26.2 billion. Leveraging WeChat, Tencent focuses on high-quality revenue growth through features like Channels and mini-games, emphasizing innovation and sustainable development in the digital landscape.\n\nConsequently, some professionals are exploring job opportunities outside of China, including roles in cryptocurrency exchanges. The post-COVID era has seen changes in Chinese work culture, with a shift towards more flexible arrangements and remote positions being considered by some companies to adapt to evolving employee expectations. However, young graduates entering the job market face increased competition and may need help finding suitable positions, leading some to pursue alternative paths like working in family businesses or creating their jobs.  16 Countries with Most Chinese Expats\n\nCopyright: rawpixel / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur methodology entails ranking countries based on the total number of Chinese expatriates residing within them. We conducted a comprehensive review of various research papers to gather accurate and up-to-date information on the presence of Chinese expats in each country.\n\nHere is our list of the 16 countries with the most Chinese expats.\n\n16.

Brazil\n\nTotal Chinese Expats: 250,000\n\nChinese expatriates seek opportunities in Brazil, a country with highest number of Chinese expats, due to economic prospects, cultural exchange, and strategic ties. China is Brazil's top trading partner, but Chinese investments declined in 2022. Brazil's reliance on China for exports poses challenges for its industrialization. Bilateral trade hit $165.6 billion in 2022, with China investing $66.1 billion from 2007 to 2020. Despite hurdles, there's room for more collaboration and investment diversification.\n\n14. Singapore\n\nTotal Chinese Expats: 451,481\n\nChinese expatriates are drawn to Singapore for its robust economy, political stability, excellent healthcare and education systems, and high quality of life. The city's strategic location in Southeast Asia is a gateway for businesses. Post-COVID-19, Chinese expats show strong shopping sentiment, with 63% spending more. They contribute significantly to the local economy through consumption patterns and investments, fueling business opportunities across various sectors.\n\n13. The United Kingdom\n\nTotal Chinese Expats: 488,847\n\nChinese expatriates are drawn to the UK for educational and career opportunities, cultural experiences, and quality of life.

France seeks broader market access in China and attracts investments from its electric car industry.\n\n11. Vietnam\n\nTotal Chinese Expats: 749,466\n\nChinese expatriates have significantly influenced Vietnam's economy, notably in trade and investment. Vietnam hosts over 4,000 Chinese investment projects worth $26 billion, making it China's sixth-largest global trading partner and the largest in Southeast Asia. Moreover, Chinese tourists are pivotal to Vietnam's tourism, with nearly six million visitors in 2019.

Japan\n\nTotal Chinese Expats: 922,000\n\nJapan has seen a rise in Chinese expatriates, who are attracted by economic opportunities and lifestyle benefits. This includes seeking investment amidst China's economic slowdown, better quality of life due to COVID lockdowns, and real estate prospects, especially in Tokyo, which has boosted demand for luxury housing in Japan.

South Korea\n\nTotal Chinese Expats: 1,070,566\n\nChinese expats flock to South Korea, standing twelfth among the countries with most Chinese expats, for economic opportunities, cultural exchange, education, and technological advancements. South Korea's trade dynamics with China and the US influence these trends: it experienced its first trade deficit with China in 31 years in 2023 ($18 billion) but maintained an overall trade surplus ($4.5 billion) due to strong export growth (18.0% year-on-year in January 2024, totaling $54.69 billion). Despite declining imports (7.8% in January 2024 to $54.39 billion), FDI from China remains significant, reflecting deep economic ties.\n\n8.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit has cut prices by up to 55 per cent on more than 100 core products - the largest discount offering in the company's history - to attract more enterprises and software developers as users in mainland China, as the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) picks up steam across various industries.\n\nThis new campaign, which offers an average 20 per cent reduction in prices, took effect on Thursday and includes the unit's elastic compute service (ECS), object storage service (OSS) and database product categories, Alibaba Cloud said in a statement. Hangzhou-based parent Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe initiative seeks to \"lower the threshold of cloud services for more enterprises and developers\", according to Liu Weiguang, the president of public cloud business at Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"With the rapidly increasing amount of data in China, businesses will need robust, high-performance and cost-effective computing power to help handle and analyse the data before turning them into actionable intelligence,\" Liu said. \"This is where we can help, as we aim to become the most open cloud [platform] and help our customers to turn AI into productivity.\"\n\nA roomful of high-performance servers are seen stacked inside a data centre run by Alibaba Cloud in mainland China.

These resources are stored inside data centres.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrices of Alibaba Cloud's ECS, which provides users with virtual cloud servers, has been cut up to 36 per cent, while those for OSS - a service to store and access any amount of data from anywhere - was slashed up to 55 per cent. For database product categories, prices were reduced up to 40 per cent. Both existing and new customers can avail of the discounted prices, according to Alibaba Cloud.\n\nFounded in 2009, Alibaba Cloud currently serves 80 per cent of technology companies on the mainland, including half of firms involved in AI large language model (LLM) development, Alibaba co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai said last October at the annual Apsara Conference. LLM is the technology used to train generative AI services like ChatGPT.\n\nAlibaba Cloud's latest initiative reflects the market opportunity to address growing demand for high-performance computing resources on the mainland, where AI development efforts have rapidly expanded amid Washington's sanctions on the export of advanced semiconductors to the country.\n\nLowering prices, however, could also trigger a price war among China's major cloud services providers, as competition intensifies among vendors to support the development and deployment of innovative AI services in the country.\n\nAlibaba Cloud, which continues to have the biggest share of cloud infrastructure services spending on the mainland, initially slashed prices on a number of its core products and services on May 7 last year after announcing the initiative in April.\n\nA number of Chinese cloud firms have already made their self-developed LLMs and online platforms available to third-party developers, so they can build AI applications for a range of traditional industries.\n\nCloud infrastructure services spending in mainland China grew 18 per cent year on year to US$9.2 billion in the third quarter last year, with Alibaba Cloud recording a 39 per cent market share, according to a report in December by research firm Canalys. The cloud units of Huawei Technologies and Tencent Holdings had shares of 19 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, in the same period.\n\nEarlier this month, Alibaba reported that revenue from its Cloud Intelligence Group in the December quarter rose 3 per cent year on year to 28.06 billion yuan (US$3.95 billion) on the back of efforts to cut sales from low-margin, project-based contracts.\n\nAlibaba chief executive Eddie Wu Yongming said in a statement at that time that the company's top priority is to \"reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing\".\n\nAt present, Alibaba Cloud operates 89 availability zones - where it operates data centres - in 30 regions globally, supporting more than 4 million customers worldwide.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is rolling out its second major price cut for cloud services in years, aiming to win back users from rivals like Tencent Holdings Ltd. competing to provide the tools critical to training artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World This Is Where New Migrants Are Going When They Reach the US Supreme Court Immunity Case Jeopardizes Trump Trial Pre-Election Flawed Valuations Threaten $1.7 Trillion Private Credit Boom\n\nThe Chinese internet pioneer will slash prices starting Thursday on scores of internet-based services by as much as 55%, and by 20% on average. The discounts span more than 100 products, including data storage and elastic computing options for online processing power to clients, Alibaba executives told reporters in Beijing.\n\nThe cuts mark one of the more aggressive moves by Alibaba to stay ahead of Tencent and Baidu Inc. in the cloud business. They come after Alibaba called off a spinoff and initial public offering for the formerly fast-growing unit, a move that surprised investors hoping to buy into a key business that\u2019s essential to AI development. Alibaba\u2019s shares slid 2.3% in Hong Kong after the news, the most since Feb. 9.\n\nIt\u2019s now focusing on growing the public cloud \u2014 the domestic services arm aimed at enterprise customers \u2014 given US sanctions curtailing the supply of advanced chips to Chinese firms. Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu has taken direct control of the unit and revamped major lines.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to launch the price reduction campaign \u2014 to lower the threshold of cloud services for more enterprises and developers to reap the technological dividends and accelerate the adoption of advanced public cloud services across various industries,\u201d Liu Weiguang, president of the unit\u2019s public cloud segment, said in a statement.\n\nAlibaba has struggled over the past year to revamp its vast e-commerce, logistics and cloud empire in the face of fierce competition and geopolitical risks. The company is looking to revive growth after two years of regulatory scrutiny and Covid-era economic turbulence. It seeks to hive off non-core assets to raise capital, while dividing its sprawling operations into more clearly defined areas.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the cloud \u2014 the business spawned over a decade ago from the need to support a mammoth e-commerce operation \u2014 remains a focal point.\n\nThe company announced cuts from 15% to 50% for core products of the Alibaba Cloud in April last year, in a move aimed at capitalizing on the demand for raw computing power needed for AI models such as Alibaba\u2019s own Tongyi Qianwen. The previous round of discounts triggered fears that rivals like Tencent and Baidu will follow suit, eroding margins for a wide swath of the Chinese internet industry.\n\nRead More: Baidu Slides Most Since 2022 After AI Spending Erodes Profit\n\nThursday\u2019s cuts will apply retroactively to clients that renew their orders on discounted products for at least a year within the next three months, for the remaining undelivered cloud resources they had previously purchased.\n\nThe price cuts from China\u2019s largest cloud provider are also aimed at attracting longer-term customers, with special discounts for five-year plans. The free-usage amount for consumer storage will also double to 20GB from 10GB.\n\nAlibaba executives stressed that the discounts will open up more possibilities particularly for smaller firms. The company has backed startups such as Zhipu and Moonshot AI that are developing generative AI platforms to compete with sector leaders such as Baidu. The Chinese internet search leader reported disappointing results Wednesday, hit partly by the surging costs of AI development.\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov.\n\n(Updates with share action and comments from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Elon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience There\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc.\u2019s shares slid their most since October 2022 after reporting a 48% plunge in profit, underscoring the growing costs of training and developing AI to fend off challengers in the burgeoning arena.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Flawed Valuations Threaten $1.7 Trillion Private Credit Boom This Is Where New Migrants Are Going When They Reach the US Supreme Court to Weigh Trump Immunity, Keeps DC Trial Paused\n\nThe company reported a December-quarter net income of 2.6 billion yuan ($361 million) that missed projections, though much of that stemmed from a loss from equity accounting for preferred shares. It overshadowed a 6% rise in revenue after Baidu\u2019s ChatGPT-style service began to augment advertising sales, helping the Chinese AI leader weather a severe economic downturn. Its shares slid more than 8% in New York.\n\nBaidu\u2019s results follow disappointing numbers from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., underscoring how the private sector that once drove the world\u2019s No. 2 economy has run out of steam. The mixed performance underscored the challenges facing a company that once routinely chalked up double-digit percentage growth but is now grappling with macro and market uncertainty.\n\nTo rekindle the business, Baidu has joined Silicon Valley peers from Microsoft Corp. to Google in seeking ways to monetize generative AI. The Chinese company has attracted more than 100 million users to its ChatGPT-style service \u2014 now including a premium tier that charges a monthly subscription \u2014 giving it a headstart against peers like Tencent Holdings Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd.\n\nBut revenue generated by the AI model known as Ernie is a drop in the bucket for Baidu, which still relies mainly on search ads. Ernie will contribute \u201cseveral billion yuan\u201d of additional revenue through advertising and cloud services in 2024, billionaire founder Robin Li told analysts on a conference call, up from several hundred million yuan in the December quarter. Revenue from Baidu\u2019s pivotal cloud arm grew 11% to 5.7 billion yuan in the quarter, executives said.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, research and development costs climbed 11% last quarter, reflecting fees for servers to support generative AI development. On that front, Li said Baidu should have enough high-end training chips on hand to support Ernie\u2019s advancements over the next one to two years.\n\nThe founder previously warned against China\u2019s so-called \u201cwar of a hundred models,\u201d where big tech firms and venture investors alike pour billions of dollars into startups building AI platforms from scratch \u2014 many of them leveraging the same open-source code. Baidu is instead pitching local developers to create AI-native applications atop Ernie, including by doling out $140 million to fund such projects.\n\nIf successful, Ernie could put Baidu at the core of an AI ecosystem similar to what the GPT Store is to OpenAI. But its long-time rivals Tencent and Alibaba are also vying for what\u2019s likely a winner-takes-all market, as both firms command bigger warchests and user pools thanks to super-apps like WeChat and Taobao.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nBaidu\u2019s 4Q profit beat expectations on better cost control, though AI-related losses deepened, highlighting the continued growth challenge. Adjusted profit in Baidu Core fell 7.1% sequentially, with a 260-bp decrease in margin to 22.5%, despite a rising top-line contribution from ERNIE-Bot. The margin drop suggests that ERNIE-Bot remains unprofitable in spite of a 4.7% annual rise in \u201cother sales.\u201d\n\nRobert Lea, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nNear-term, Baidu still counts on advertising as its bread and butter \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t bode well during a downturn. The world\u2019s No. 2 economy is grappling with a property slump and deflation, forcing Chinese leaders to resort to wide-ranging policies including rate cuts and direct fund injections to boost investor confidence.\n\nRevenue from Baidu\u2019s core businesses including online marketing and the cloud met analysts\u2019 expectations during the December quarter. Its streaming offshoot IQiyi Inc. barely grew its topline after losing some paid subscribers, but profitability continued to improve.\n\nOnce the runaway leader in desktop search, Baidu has over the years tried to adapt its business to the mobile era, albeit with mixed success. In January, the Beijing-based company walked away from a $3.6 billion deal to acquire Joyy Inc.\u2019s streaming service YY, citing the lack of regulatory approval.\n\nIts shares have dropped roughly 30% since July in Hong Kong, underperforming peers as the high costs of AI development compound investor concerns over the weak economy.\n\nRead More: Alibaba\u2019s New CEO Elevates AI to Top Priority in Revamp\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations China\u2019s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Why Baidu, Alibaba, and Other Chinese Stocks Sank on Wednesday",
        "content": "Stocks of some of China's most widely held companies were sinking in unison on Wednesday, with several catalysts sending them lower. One company delivered a disappointing financial report, concerns about China's economy continued, and the country's policymakers announced moves that shook up its stock market.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, several of China's biggest technology stocks lagged the broader market. Shares of Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) slumped 7.2%, Tencent Holdings(OTC: TCEHY) declined 3.9%, and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) fell 3.4%, as of 1:22 p.m. ET today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDisappointing results\n\nBaidu reported its fourth-quarter results, and investors were not pleased. The company generated revenue of $4.9 billion, up 6% year over year, while the diluted earnings per American depositary share (ADS) of $0.95 cratered 50%.\n\nTo give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $4.86 billion and per-ADS earnings of $2.48, so profits fell far short of investor expectations.\n\nThe news wasn't all bad, as Baidu's ChatGPT-style offering, ERNIE, helped boost revenue, despite an ongoing downturn in advertising, which is the company's bread and butter. On the other hand, steep spending on artificial intelligence (AI) helped erode the bottom line, weighing on profits.\n\nThe company noted that revenue from its core business, which consists mainly of online advertising, cloud computing, and AI, grew 7% to $3.87 billion, while growth at its streaming platform iQiyi lagged, increasing 2% to $1.1 billion.\n\nA weak economic backdrop\n\nBaidu is the latest company to report earnings that highlight the current challenges besetting China's economy. The country is suffering from high unemployment among younger citizens, slowing growth, and lower consumer spending.\n\nAny economist will tell you that consumer spending is the backbone of an economy, so this could be a bad harbinger.\n\nExacerbating the situation is the crisis in China's real estate market. Just last month, a judge ordered the liquidation of property developer China Evergrande Group, which helps illustrate the ongoing challenges in the country as property transactions have slumped.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, home sales in China declined 6.5%, and market commentators suggest the worst isn't over. By some accounts, real estate represents roughly 25% of China's economy, which just makes things worse.\n\nLastly, the country's moves to curb certain investing strategies are not being well received. Chinese securities regulators announced a crackdown on short-selling, going so far as to say that malicious short-sellers would \"lose their shirts and rot in jail,\" according to a report by Reuters.\n\nChina also announced curbs on quantitative or computer-driven trading. Regulators directed quant funds to stop accepting new cash and discontinue existing \"direct market access\" products. These recent moves have cast a pall on the market, helping send these popular stocks lower.\n\nWill investors follow the government's lead?\n\nInvestors already leery about the worsening economy in China have more reasons to be wary. Furthermore, each of our trio of companies listed above is highly dependent on consumer spending and a strong economy:\n\nBaidu is China's leading internet search provider, and like Alphabet's Google -- its U.S. counterpart -- it relies on digital advertising for the vast majority of its revenue. Weakness in the economy translates to much lower ad sales. Alibaba is one of the country's largest digital retailers. Lower consumer spending equals less sales. Tencent's social media makes much of its money from advertising, while its gaming and ancillary services are highly dependent on consumer discretionary income.\n\nIn the face of macroeconomic headwinds and high unemployment, consumer spending in China is slowing, which could further weaken an already fragile economy. As a result, the future is uncertain, particularly for companies that depend on consumers for their livelihoods.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not suggesting investors should avoid these stocks completely. In fact, they are currently trading at compelling valuations, as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu are selling for 14 times, 12 times, and 12 times earnings, respectively -- each a significant discount to the broader market. And Baidu and Alibaba are selling for a price-to-sales ratio of less than 2, the benchmark for underpriced stocks.\n\nThat said, investors should factor China's weakening economic outlook into their thinking and ensure they approach these companies with a long-term outlook.\n\nFurthermore, investing in China carries additional risk, and any position should be a modest part of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Baidu wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc.\u2019s revenue rose 6% after its ChatGPT-style service began to augment advertising sales, helping the Chinese AI leader weather a severe economic downturn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers A Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Nvidia\u2019s $70 Million Florida Supercomputer Hobbled by DeSantis Law\n\nThe company reported sales of nearly 35 billion yuan ($4.9 billion) for the three months ended December, broadly in line with analysts\u2019 projections. Net income slid 48% to 2.6 billion yuan.\n\nBaidu\u2019s results follow disappointing numbers from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., underscoring how the private sector that once drove the world\u2019s No. 2 economy has run out of steam. To rekindle growth, Baidu has joined Silicon Valley peers from Microsoft Corp. to Google in seeking ways to monetize generative AI. The Chinese company has attracted more than 100 million users to its ChatGPT-style service \u2014 now including a premium tier that charges a monthly subscription \u2014 giving it a headstart against peers like Tencent Holdings Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd. But revenue generated by the AI model, known as Ernie, is a drop in the bucket for Baidu, which still relies mainly on search ads.\n\nBillionaire founder Robin Li has warned against China\u2019s so-called \u201cwar of a hundred models,\u201d where big tech firms and venture investors alike pour billions of dollars into startups building AI platforms from scratch \u2014 many of them leveraging the same open-source code. Baidu is instead pitching local developers to create AI-native applications atop Ernie, including by doling out $140 million to fund such projects.\n\nIf successful, Ernie could put Baidu at the core of an AI ecosystem similar to what the GPT Store is to OpenAI. But its long-time rivals Tencent and Alibaba are also vying for what\u2019s likely a winner-takes-all market, as both firms command bigger warchests and user pools thanks to super apps like WeChat and Taobao.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nConsensus expects Baidu\u2019s earnings growth to slow to just 4.6% in 2024, in spite of a bigger contribution from the ERNIE Bot generative-AI tool, as rising promotional and investment costs in the AI business hurt margins. We expect Baidu\u2019s AI ventures to remain loss-making this year, with rising caution in China\u2019s corporate sector a risk to profit in the core search business.\n\nRobert Lea, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nNear term, Baidu still counts on advertising sales as its bread and butter \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t bode well during China\u2019s downturn. The world\u2019s No. 2 economy is grappling with a property slump and deflation, forcing Chinese leaders to resort to wide-ranging policies including rate cuts and direct fund injections to boost investor confidence.\n\nOnce the runaway leader in desktop search, Baidu has over the years tried to adapt its business to the mobile era, albeit with mixed success. In January, the Beijing-based company walked away from a $3.6 billion deal to acquire Joyy Inc.\u2019s streaming service YY, citing the lack of regulatory approval.\n\nIts shares have dropped roughly 30% since July in Hong Kong, underperforming peers as the high costs of AI development compound investor concerns over the weak economy.\n\nRead More: Alibaba\u2019s New CEO Elevates AI to Top Priority in Revamp\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

It led a $1 billion funding round in Moonshot AI with existing backer Monolith Management, boosting the year-old firm\u2019s valuation eight-fold to some $2.5 billion, people familiar with the deal said. They joined previous backers including food delivery giant Meituan\u2019s investment arm Long-Z and Hongshan, formerly Sequoia China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private transaction.\n\nFounded in March 2023, Moonshot AI is among the better-known startups developing generative artificial intelligence in China, hoping to eventually match the likes of OpenAI and Google. It rolled out its Kimi chatbot to the public last November and has since launched a platform for developers to build AI applications atop its model. Its valuation stood at just $300 million when it secured initial funding.\n\nMoonshot AI declined to comment on the company\u2019s fundraising details, which were first reported by local media including 36kr.

Tsai has said the cloud unit now hosts half of China\u2019s generative AI firms and serves about 80% of the country\u2019s technology companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut they\u2019re getting into a field that\u2019s getting crowded, as venture capital firms and tech leaders pour billions into training and developing AI services, mirroring a wave of activity across Silicon Valley and Europe. Other Chinese AI startups raising significant amounts from investors included Baichuan and Zhipu.\n\nThat\u2019s despite lingering concerns about US sanctions, which bar Chinese firms from buying the most powerful Nvidia Corp. chips used to train and run AI models. Washington has targeted China\u2019s AI efforts because the technology has geopolitical and military applications, complicating an already tense relationship.\n\nAlibaba previously joined a $300 million-plus round for Zhipu in 2023 alongside longtime rival Tencent. The company is trying to revive the cloud business and integrate AI and its inhouse model \u2014 Tongyi Qianwen \u2014 across a sprawling business that also spans entertainment.\n\nRead More: China Startup Deals Plumb Four-Year Low Despite Mega Chip Deals\n\n(Updates to specify the Meituan investment unit in the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 7.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.84 indicates a change of -0.3% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $31.19 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $131.88 billion and $141.2 billion estimates indicate +4.6% and +7.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $36.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.46%. The EPS surprise was -2.2%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Costco (COST) earns a Zacks Rank #2 10 days from its next quarterly earnings release on March 7, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.65 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $3.65 Most Accurate Estimate and the $3.60 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Costco has an Earnings ESP of 1.58%.\n\nCOST is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Alibaba (BABA) as well.\n\nSlated to report earnings on May 16, 2024, Alibaba holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.57 a share 80 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nAlibaba's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.43% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56.\n\nStory continues\n\nCOST and BABA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding is set for a comeback after several years of rising competition and macroeconomic pressures, according to the company's co-founder and chairman Joe Tsai, who is backing the Chinese e-commerce giant to bounce back.\n\nAlibaba is \"a lot more confident\" about its position as one of China's top e-commerce players as it undergoes a restructuring process with new management in place, Tsai told US media outlet CNBC in a report published on Monday. \"Where we didn't feel as confident as before, we felt the competitive pressure, but now we're back,\" Tsai said.\n\nTsai said that in recent years Alibaba had not done as well as previously in \"delivering performance\" for reasons including competition, economic headwinds, the regulatory environment and rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nBut it \"comes down to\" how well Alibaba competes and how well it serves its customers, and those are the areas the company is trying to improve through the restructuring, said Tsai. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAlibaba in March last year announced a major overhaul of its sprawling empire, splitting its businesses into six independently-run entities. A plan to spin off its cloud unit was later cancelled. An initial public offering of its logistics unit Cainiao is being held back for better timing, said Tsai in the interview.\n\nAlibaba has faced intense competition from the likes of budget shopping firm PDD Holdings, which operates Pinduoduo in China and Temu overseas, and ByteDance, whose short video app Douyin has gained traction in online shopping on the mainland.\n\nIn November, PDD's market cap briefly overtook Alibaba's, reaching US$192 billion on Nasdaq, while Alibaba's valuation fell below US$190 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The pricing competition is definitely there, and we have to take a few lessons from our competitors,\" Tsai told CNBC. \"But the good thing is that it can be done. It's within our control.\"\n\nTsai in June last year took over as Alibaba chairman after several years away from day-to-day operations, succeeding Daniel Zhang Yong, who was to focus on the group's cloud unit before stepping down in September.\n\nA management reshuffle included installing Eddie Wu Yongming as the new chief executive at Taobao and Tmall Group, Alibaba's most important profit earner. Wu also heads the cloud unit.\n\nAlibaba still faces headwinds in restoring growth. It reported lower-than-expected financial results in the December quarter earlier this month, with net income attributable to ordinary shareholders down 69 per cent year on year, and net income down 4 per cent under non-generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nThe company attributed the profit drop primarily to losses from its equity investments and the impairment of intangible assets at hypermarket Sun Art and impairment of goodwill at its video platform Youku.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Alibaba Discloses State Ownership in More Than 12 Business Units",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. disclosed a wider web of Chinese government stakes in its business units than previously known, following an inquiry from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Zelenskiy Says 31,000 Troops Killed as Ukraine Seeks US Aid Decision Within Month Norwegian Cruise Ship Halted at Mauritius Due to Outbreak Jack Ma-Backed Ant Outbids Citadel Securities for Credit Suisse\u2019s China JV Risk Models Behind World\u2019s Best Hedge Fund Strategy Are Getting a Lot Harder to Crack\n\nThe Hangzhou-based e-commerce pioneer said in filings in the US and Hong Kong over the weekend that more than a dozen of its entities are partially owned by Chinese state-owned enterprises or foreign sovereign wealth funds. In the notice, the company said the disclosures were made \u201cin response to certain comments from the staff of the SEC\u201d as an amendment to its earlier filing from July.\n\nThe filings come as China\u2019s ruling Communist Party said this month that it will play a bigger role in steering the country\u2019s technology and science development. Beijing\u2019s tightening grip over its tech companies in recent years has intensified investor concern and the potential for greater scrutiny in the US.\n\nChinese state-owned enterprises had shares in six of Alibaba\u2019s direct-sales businesses, which contributed less than 6% of its total revenue in the fiscal year to March 2023. Five of those stakes were below 10% and the other was below 30%, according to the filings.\n\nThe company also said that state-owned companies took ownership in several business entities in sports, health, logistics, and local consumer services. In addition, Alibaba disclosed small stakes in some units by sovereign wealth funds from Singapore, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\n\nAlibaba did not identify the specific entities in its filing. Its corporate structure is highly complex and undergoing an overhaul as the company considers splitting off several tentpole business lines into standalone companies. A representative for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest filing adds to the so-called \u201cgolden shares\u201d \u2014 nominal stakes of typically 1% \u2014 that Chinese government entities took last year in units from Chinese tech leaders including Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. This share structure in theory allows the government to nominate directors or sway key company decisions, a move seen as granting Beijing another lever to influence players in the world\u2019s largest internet arena.\n\nAlibaba has struggled over the past year to revamp its vast e-commerce, logistics and cloud empire, after setbacks in its ambitious restructuring project. Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu has now taken direct control of its core businesses, in a bid to win back users in the face of rising competition and regulatory risks domestically and abroad.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America Why Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place Can the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?

        "title": "Better Comeback Stock: Alibaba vs. Peloton",
        "content": "Alibaba Group(NYSE: BABA) and Peloton Interactive(NASDAQ: PTON) have both frustrated plenty of investors over the past few years. Alibaba's stock hit its all-time high in October 2020 as the bulls embraced the Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader, but it subsequently sank more than 75% as it faced fierce macro, regulatory, and competitive headwinds.\n\nPeloton's stock closed at its record high in January 2021 as its sales of connected bikes and subscriptions accelerated throughout the pandemic. But it then shed roughly 97% of its value as its growth stalled out amid broad economic reopening. Could either of these beaten-down stocks be a worthwhile turnaround play for patient investors? Image source: Peloton.\n\nAlibaba's high-growth days are over\n\nAlibaba's downfall started when China's antitrust regulators levied a record $2.75 billion fine against its e-commerce business in 2021. Alibaba was then barred from locking in its merchants with exclusive deals, using aggressive loss-leading promotions, and making big investments or acquisitions without the government's permission.\n\nThose restrictions eroded Alibaba's defenses against its top competitors, PDD Holdings and JD.com. China's unpredictable zero-COVID lockdowns and other macro issues also exacerbated its slowdown.\n\nAs Alibaba's Chinese e-commerce marketplaces cooled off, its cloud business struggled to grow as companies reined in their spending to cope with the macro headwinds. It also lost ByteDance's TikTok as a major customer as it shifted the personal data of its overseas users to Oracle's cloud platform in 2022.\n\nAll of that pressure caused Alibaba's revenue to grow just 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last March), compared to its 19% growth in fiscal 2022 and 41% growth in fiscal 2021.\n\nThat slowdown convinced the bears that Alibaba's high-growth days were over, but it's expanding its higher-growth overseas e-commerce business -- which houses its Southeast Asian marketplace Lazada, its Turkish marketplace Trendyol, and its cross-border marketplace AliExpress -- to offset that slowdown. Its other major growth engine is its Cainiao logistics division, which it's expanding as a standalone business to provide more services for third-party customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% as its Chinese e-commerce and cloud businesses stabilize. However, they also expect its net income to rise at a CAGR of 24% as it reins in its spending and spins off some of its units as fresh IPOs. Based on those expectations, its stock looks dirt cheap at 11 times forward earnings.\n\nPeloton is slowing resolving its biggest issues\n\nPeloton's business started to crumble when gyms reopened and cheaper competitors entered the market. It expanded its business with a connected treadmill and other products, but its revenue still dropped 11% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and 22% in fiscal 2023. It expects another 3% decline in fiscal 2024.\n\nAs Peloton's growth stalled out, it laid off thousands of employees, outsourced its production to a Taiwanese manufacturer, and started selling its products on Amazon to expand its reach beyond its first-party website and showrooms.\n\nPeloton also reduced its equipment prices to keep pace with its cheaper competitors, but it raised its subscription fees to offset its lower gross margin. It believes the expansion of its higher-margin subscription business will ultimately reduce its dependence on its lower-margin sales of bikes, treadmills, and other equipment.\n\nThose strategies enabled it to expand its margins and narrow its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) losses. Analysts expect its adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in fiscal 2025, but it's also expected to stay unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for the foreseeable future. On the bright side, analysts expect its revenue to finally rise 5% in fiscal 2025 and 7% in fiscal 2026 as it \"rightsizes\" its business.\n\nPeloton's stock looks cheap at a price-to-sales ratio of 1, but there's no guarantee that it will survive. It only served 718,000 paid app subscribers at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 -- compared to 2.97 million at the end of fiscal 2022 -- and it could run out of room to grow its revenue per subscriber before its entire business model implodes.\n\nThe obvious winner: Alibaba\n\nAlibaba lost its mojo over the past few years, but I believe it's still worth owning as a slow-growth e-commerce and cloud stock. Its stock is cheap, it generates plenty of cash, and it's constantly buying back its shares. Peloton won't go bankrupt this year, but it still needs to stabilize its core business before it can be considered a worthwhile investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Hidden Gem: Unveiling the Rising Star Within Alibaba's Vast Empire, and Why Investors Should Be Paying Close Attention",
        "content": "Once a giant in the Chinese technology industry, Alibaba Group(NYSE: BABA) has fallen from grace in recent years. It faced numerous challenges, such as competition and the crackdown by the Chinese government, which impacted its performance. And after the conglomerate delivered its weakest growth -- 2% -- in the last fiscal year, investors aren't too optimistic about its prospects.\n\nYet, within its vast empire lies a hidden gem quietly emerging as the next growth engine for the company. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlibaba's overseas e-commerce business\n\nAlibaba is generally known for its flagship e-commerce businesses, Tmall and Taobao. But its e-commerce empire goes well beyond its home turf, focusing mainly on two types of business models.\n\nThe first part relates to cross-border e-commerce business operating under AliExpress and Alibaba.com. The former is a global retail marketplace, available in 17 languages besides English, focusing on selling products from China to overseas consumers.\n\nThe latter is a wholesale marketplace focusing mainly on selling products in bulk to overseas customers, especially merchants who resell these products locally. According to Alibaba, over 47 million buyers from over 190 countries sourced business opportunities or completed transactions on Alibaba.com in the year ended March 31, 2023.\n\nThe second part of Alibaba's overseas e-commerce empire stems from its majority ownership in local marketplaces Lazada and Trendyol. Lazada is one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia, behind the leader, Shopee. It also operates an e-commerce logistics network in this region, complementing its e-commerce marketplace offerings, similar to the symbiotic relationship between Tmall and Taobao with Cainiao.\n\nTrendyol, on the other hand, is the leading e-commerce platform in Turkey in terms of GMV and order volume. It serves consumers with a broad selection of products and services through its e-commerce business and offers local consumer services such as food and groceries. Like Lazada, Trendyol also operates its logistics service under Trendyol Express and Trendyol Go. Trendyol also helps Turkish merchants sell across six continents.\n\nStory continues\n\nCollectively, these businesses form Alibaba's International Digital Commerce Group. In the first nine months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, this group delivered a 46% increase in revenue, significantly outpacing groupwide revenue growth of 9%.\n\nInternational digital commerce has bright prospects\n\nAlibaba's international e-commerce business might be small -- its revenue is around one-fifth of the group's China e-commerce business -- but its prospects are vast.\n\nIts relatively small size means it has significantly more room to grow before reaching the size of its sister companies. Besides, the overseas e-commerce market is massive (and growing). For perspective, the Chinese e-commerce industry is estimated at $2.9 trillion, accounting for around 50% of global e-commerce.\n\nBut as China was the world's most penetrated e-commerce market in 2023 (about 50%), its peer countries will likely see higher growth rates in the coming years as they catch up on market penetration. Suffice it to say that the growth opportunities should be tremendous for Alibaba's international e-commerce group as it focuses on this growing pie.\n\nFor instance, the recent surge in cross-border e-commerce led by companies like Temu (owned by PDD Holdings), Shein, and Alibaba's AliExpress is a significant tailwind that will remain for years. Leveraging the extensive supply chain in China and their experience in China, leading Chinese e-commerce platforms turn their attention to overseas consumers to sustain growth, especially as competition in China intensifies.\n\nInternally, Alibaba's recent reorganization of its massive empire into separate (and independent) operating units provides the international business group the leverage it needs to chart its path toward success. With its management team and board in place, the overseas e-commerce business unit can set a long-term strategic direction, make better decisions, and execute faster to win in its respective markets.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this segment reported the fastest growth among all the business groups within Alibaba, with revenue up by 44% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023. Comparatively, groupwide revenue was up by just 5%. This trend could continue in the coming quarters if not years.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce industry has become hyper-competitive in recent years thanks to the rise of next-generation e-commerce players like Pinduoduo and Douying. While Alibaba's e-commerce businesses (Tmall and Taobao) remain the most prominent player in China, it is increasingly more difficult for them to grow on their home turf.\n\nUnderstandably, the conglomerate is emphasizing its international e-commerce business more to sustain its growth ambitions. It will not be surprising for this business unit to sustain its high-double-digit growth rate in the next few quarters (or even years). Investors should, therefore, start paying more attention to this rapidly expanding business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investors have always searched for signs of bullishness in stocks that the market has discounted. The pursuit of value is never-ending.

Each of those shares has plenty of positive catalysts, which suggest reasons for bullishness. The other stock is, or you\u2019ll be the most important company now. Investors continue to wrestle with valuation concerns regarding that stock. Ultimately, I believe bullishness will prevail in its case.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock continues to be plagued by bearish sentiment that has lowered its stock price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnce the darling of China\u2019s Tech scene, the company has slipped of late. Other e-commerce firms from China have taken their place\u2014namely, PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). The company owns Temu, which continues to redefine Chinese e-commerce. Temu\u2019s emergence provides yet another reason to be bearish on Alibaba. China is facing a period of deflation proving stickier than initially anticipated. That makes Alibaba particularly risky at the moment. However, many contrarians are beginning to bet on Alibaba at this time.\n\nMichael Burry, made famous in The Big Short, is among them. Alibaba currently represents the largest holding at Scion Asset Management, Burry\u2019s firm.\n\nYet, Burry\u2019s opinion is just one of many. Investors looking for other reasons to bet on Alibaba should also consider that the company is the largest cloud provider in China. The company is analogous to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its composition, boasting a dominant cloud business. Cloud is one of the biggest areas of AI investment and potential, giving Alibaba an upside.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) is a chip stock that remains undervalued. The company is among the best-known providers of memory chips in the semiconductor conductor industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerally speaking, the chips that Micron provides are in high demand. They have applications across a number of important and growing markets. Memory chips are vitally important to the continued growth of the artificial intelligence and machine learning markets. Furthermore, Cloud computing, 5G and The Internet of Things (IoT) will require greater volumes of memory chips.\n\nYet, the semiconductor industry remains mired in a negative period of cyclicality. The semiconductor industry routinely undergoes boom and bust periods, resulting in rapidly shifting tides. The belief that Micron is a bull in bear\u2019s clothing is somewhat of a contrarian opinion. The stock has much more upside than downside based on its current price. The fact that leading firms in the semiconductor industry are bullish about 2024, namely Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), may be enough for investors to establish a position.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to characterize Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a sleeper stock. Just about every investor is aware of its emergence over the past year.\n\nFurthermore, bearish investors cite valuation metrics such as its relatively high P/E ratio. Those Bears remain steadfast in their belief that Nvidia is overpriced. They use that notion to logically argue that share prices should move lower in the immediate future.\n\nI\u2019ll make the same simple counterargument I\u2019ve made several times regarding that idea: More than 11% of all semiconductor firms currently have a higher P/E ratio than Nvidia. One could easily argue that Nvidia is in the 99.99th percentile of all firms. Its valuation suggests that it is only trading in the 89th percentile. That poses a simple question: is Nvidia better or worse than 89% of its peer group? If you\u2019re like me, you believe it is better and thus deserving of a higher price moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the top 20 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can directly go to the Top 5 Languages with the Hardest Grammar for English Speakers.\n\nChinese as a Language\n\nArabic, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese are among the toughest languages for English speakers to learn, particularly due to their complex grammar, writing, and pronunciation systems. Moreover, Mandarin Chinese is also one of the most spoken native languages in the world. According to data from Ethnologue, it is spoken by over 1 billion speakers around the globe. Mandarin is also one of the most commonly spoken and official dialects of Chinese, spoken by approximately 80% of the Chinese population. According to the European Business Review, the influence of the Chinese language is growing steadily across the globe. In addition, Chinese language education is part of the national education system of over 70 countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa. The growing influence of the Chinese language is attributed to China's economic power and the staggering number of Chinese speakers around the globe. You can look at the 17 Hardest Languages to Learn in the World for Non-English Speakers to read more about the hardest languages.\n\nEconomic Outlook of China\n\nChina is one of the largest economies in the world. According to a report by the World Trade Organization, China ranked 32nd on the list of the largest exporters 40 years ago and has shown significant growth since then. The Chinese economy has grown at the rate of 9.1% annually over the past four decades. As of 2024, China's GDP stands at $18.56 trillion. Furthermore, based on purchasing power parity, China boasts one of the world's largest shares of global GDP, at 19.05%.\n\nRegarding GDP growth, the Chinese economy experienced slower-than-usual GDP growth of 3.2% in 2022. The slower growth is attributed to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, a decline in the housing market, and sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19. According to a report by the Bank of China, the GDP growth rates for 2023 were projected to be 3.6%, 5.3%, and 6.6%, based on pessimistic, baseline, and optimistic expectations. Moreover, 2023 was also marked as the first year of implementation of the strategic plan presented by the 20th CPC National Congress. Although the investment growth rates were expected to remain low for 2023, the fallout from COVID-19, recovering consumption rates, and pro-growth policies helped stabilize the economy.

While Chinese is one of the hardest languages for English speakers to learn, there are several others. With this context, let's look at the top 20 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers. Top 20 Languages with the Hardest Grammar for English Speakers\n\nA close up macro image of someone using a mobile device to learn a new language.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the top 20 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers, we used the Foreign Services Institute data on Foreign Language Training. Foreign Services Institute categorizes languages into 4 broad categories based on the number of class hours required to learn a language. For this article, we used Category 3 and Category 4, which require 1,100 and 2,200 class hours for English speakers to learn.\n\nThe Foreign Services Institute does not give individual rankings for the languages. Therefore, we employed a consensus methodology to rank our languages. We shifted through the rankings of Berlitz, Busuu, Southwest Journal, Mango Languages, Far and Wide, and Solo Lingual to get a list of 40 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers. We selected only those languages that belonged to Category 3 and Category 4 of the Foreign Services Institute data and appeared in at least 3 of our sources. Next, we ranked these languages based on their average rank among our sources. We used the number of mentions as a tie-breaker for instances where two or more languages had the same rank.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The investment firm that manages part of the fortune of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Joe Tsai sold most of its shares in the alternative asset giant Blue Owl Capital Inc. during the fourth quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales T-Bills Without Tax Bills? This Fund Says It Cracked the Code Stocks Rally as AI Craze Sweeps Across the World: Markets Wrap AT&T Outage Triggered by Company Work on Network Expansion US Lands on Moon in Historic Feat for Private Spacecraft\n\nBlue Pool Capital Ltd. sold 34.3 million Blue Owl shares, or 83% of its remaining holdings, according to data from regulatory filings compiled by Bloomberg. The shares would have been worth about $460 million at the volume-weighted average price of the stock over the three months.\n\nBlue Pool representatives didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Blue Owl declined to comment.\n\nBlue Owl\u2019s share price gained 41% in 2023 as investors piled into private credit funds and rising interest rates curbed the appeal of some other assets. Alibaba co-founders Jack Ma and Tsai have been buying shares in their Chinese e-commerce giant. Its US-listed stock had plunged about 80% over two years to the recent low in 2022 amid tightening domestic regulatory scrutiny, a weakening Chinese economy and subdued consumer confidence.\n\nMore than half of Blue Owl\u2019s $165 billion assets are in credit, a space that Oliver Weisberg, who leads Blue Pool, has publicly expressed his enthusiasm for. The rest is in businesses that buy stakes in alternative asset managers, lend money to them as well as make investments in sports companies and in the property industry, according to its website.\n\nA Blue Pool entity was the second-largest shareholder of Blue Owl\u2019s class-A shares in October 2021, trailing Koch Industries Inc., a regulatory filing showed.\n\nMa, who was once China\u2019s richest person and an outspoken billionaire, faded from public view after Beijing clamped down in 2020. He bought about $50 million of Alibaba stock last quarter, while Tsai \u2014 Ma\u2019s longtime confidante \u2014 also separately purchased about $150 million of shares in his first such move since 2017, Bloomberg News reported in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlue Pool bought Alibaba American Depositary Receipts worth $152 million during the fourth quarter, the only other US stock holding it was required to disclose then.\n\nBlue Owl\u2019s share price is up 20% this year, helped by double-digit 2023 fee-related earnings and dividend growth. The New York-based company expanded fee-paying assets by more than 80% since 2021, executives said during its Feb. 9 earnings call.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s board approved another $25 billion in stock repurchases earlier this month, expanding a buyback that was already among the country\u2019s largest. Once China\u2019s dominant internet company, it has lost market share to rivals such as PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd. It posted a lower-than-projected 5% rise in December quarter revenue, well off the pace of previous years, while net income fell 70%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA24\u2019s Risky Hollywood Moment Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World\u2019s Biggest EV Market How Capital One\u2019s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers Why Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Bridgewater Associates is the world's largest hedge fund with over $196 billion in assets under management (as of Sept 30, 2023). While the firm posted a loss in fiscal 2023, its flagship fund All Weather was up 10.6% last year.\n\nRay Dalio, Bridgewater's co-founder and former chief investment officer, has been a long-time believer in portfolio diversification and optimal risk-to-reward ratio usage. \"Risk and diversification are of paramount importance, and the fact is that if you diversify well, you can reduce your risk by 70% or 80% if you take uncorrelated, good things,\" Dalio told Investopedia.\n\nWhile iShares Core S&P 500ETF (NYSE:IVV) is Bridgewater's largest holding, accounting for approximately 5.7% of the total portfolio as of Sept. 30, the hedge fund is moderately bullish on Chinese stocks.\n\nThis comes as China's economic slowdown, coupled with other headwinds, has caused stocks to plummet for quite some time, making their valuations lucrative. As the Chinese government takes steps to address the internal turmoil amid the nationwide property crisis, Chinese stocks might gain momentum in the latter half of the year.\n\nSome of the most promising Chinese stocks are as follows.\n\nPDD Holdings Inc.\n\nShares of PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) have slumped by over 6% so far this year amid concerns regarding China's economic slowdown. However, PDD's flagship Temu platform has been gaining popularity, boasting approximately 50 million monthly users as of January.\n\nSince its launch in the U.S. in September 2022, Temu has rapidly grown to become a dominant player in the discount retail space, accounting for roughly 17% of the nation's total market share. Temu has nearly 750 million monthly users worldwide, driving PDD's success as one of the biggest retailers in China. It is currently the eighth-largest company in China in terms of market capitalization and the second-largest retailer after Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cTemu's value positioning, the gamification of its app, the increase in ad spend, its vast assortment and its close supplier relationships are what we believe is driving the company's growth,\u201d market intelligence firm Sensor Tower stated in a note.\n\nThe Benchmark Co. currently has a Buy rating on PDD stock with a price target of $215, indicating a potential upside of nearly 60%.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nAlibaba\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), China's largest e-commerce retailer, has been recouping after facing an intense shakedown with Chinese regulators. The company was charged with administering monopolistic practices and was subsequently fined $2.8 billion in a landmark antitrust case in 2021. This, along with the country's economic slowdown, has caused Alibaba to deliver lackluster performance over the past couple of years. Shares of Alibaba have slumped over 26% over the past year.\n\nAlibaba Co-Founders Jack Ma and Joe Tsai have raised their stakes in Alibaba, instilling market optimism regarding the company's growth prospects. Ma bought approximately $50 million worth of Alibaba stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is currently the largest individual shareholder. Tsai has a 1.4% stake in Alibaba as of last year through his family investment vehicle Blue Pool Management, making him the second largest shareholder of Alibaba.\n\nThe company has become attractive at its current valuations. Michael Burry, often known as the Big Short Investor, who generated roughly $800 million from his bet on the 2008 crisis, increased his investment in Alibaba recently.\n\nBurry increased his total BABA holdings by 25,000, or 50%, in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSusquehanna International Investment Bank has a Positive rating on Alibaba stock with a price target of $135, indicating a potential upside of over 82%. JPMorgan has an Overweight rating on the Chinese retailer, with a price target of $110, indicating a potential upside of roughly 50%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has a market capitalization of $188.95 billion.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the largest retailer and e-commerce company in China. Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China\u2019s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were down in the fourth quarter due largely to the delay of the previously announced spin-off of its cloud division. Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China. While the company is seeing early progress in its efforts to re-invigorate customer engagement and retention as well as merchant investment initiatives, we believe this investment will likely take some time to flow through to accelerating earnings growth. As such, we remain investors but have reduced our position as we monitor further progress.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAn e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is in 16th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "title": "7 Unstoppable Software Stocks Set to Soar in 2024",
        "content": "After witnessing some of the hottest software stocks skyrocket to dizzying valuations over the past few years, many investors wonder if opportunities remain in this high-flying sector. With sales multiples stretching well into the double digits for companies like Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG), I believe the easy money has already been made. Many of these momentum darlings now seem primed for a pullback after their parabolic rises.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking there isn\u2019t still untapped potential in lesser-known software names. Targeting more niche players with stable business models (but lacking the hype) can still provide significant upside. With the breakneck speed of technological innovation, software has become the driving force behind nearly every industry. Software stocks have handsomely rewarded investors over the past decade and will continue to do so if you rotate into the right ones. Here are seven software stocks to look into right now.\n\nACV Auctions (ACVA) Photo of a man sitting in a self-driving vehicle on a city street.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe used vehicle market has taken a hit, as purchasing power deteriorated after the post-pandemic demand boom. With inflation squeezing disposable incomes, middle and lower-middle-class buyers curtailed spending on big-ticket discretionary items like used cars. Consequently, many used car retailers saw business drop-offs. However, I believe the tide is turning, and ACV Auctions (NASDAQ:ACVA) presents an intriguing opportunity as a standout in this niche sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACV Auctions brings transparency and efficiency to dealers. Dealers can buy and sell inventory through the company\u2019s live auctions, while leveraging vehicle inspections, transport, financing, and inventory management services. Despite the sector downturn, ACV Auctions has maintained strong growth momentum. Its top line expanded even amidst the industry chaos. And while its share price remains down 61% from its peak, ACV has held up better than other used vehicle retailers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith profitability potentially on tap for 2024 and explosive earnings growth expected afterward, I believe the market under-appreciates ACV Auctions\u2019 prospects. Analyst\u2019s 2025 earnings per share estimates put its forward price-earnings ratio at 27-times, which is quite reasonable for a high-growth SaaS business. Consensus estimates see earnings per share rising 9-fold from 2025 to 2031 alongside 20% annual revenue growth. Given the immense TAM in used vehicle auctions and ACV\u2019s leadership, I see substantial upside even from today\u2019s depressed valuations. This makes ACV a compelling, under-the-radar software stock to buy before what I expect to be a vertical ascent.\n\nOpera (OPRA) a visualization of Internet communications superimposed on a photo of a city skyline\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBeyond its classic Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) browser and Opera Mini, Opera has refreshed its browser lineup to appeal to youth. Opera GX is tailored to gamers and integrates well with streaming platforms like Twitch and Discord. Opera canvassed modern internet users by baking in features like AI capabilities, a crypto wallet, and a VPN. The moves have paid off \u2013 many Gen Zers have switched to this browser from Chrome.\n\nDespite industry turmoil, Opera delivered 11 straight quarters of 20%+ revenue growth. Its latest results blew away expectations. The company brought in $103 million in revenue, representing 20% year-over-year growth, while the company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin hit 23%. Additionally, Opera\u2019s 2024 revenue growth is estimated at 15%, with earnings per share expected to hit $1. At just 12-times 2024 earnings, I believe Opera looks extremely undervalued, particularly for a software company putting up this kind of growth.\n\nAs Opera continues enhancing its innovative browser and expanding its user base, I see a tangible upside even after its stellar 63% returns this year. The market may be snoozing on Opera now, but with its attractive growth-value proposition, this niche software stock appears positioned to soar considerably higher in 2024.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) owns two e-commerce platforms \u2013 Pinduoduo and Temu. As China\u2019s second most popular platform behind Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) in terms of monthly active users, Pinduoduo made tremendous inroads in Chinese e-commerce. Its Groupon-style model, built around social interactions and aggressive discounts, has proved enormously successful.\n\nNotably, Temu represents PDD\u2019s effort to translate this formula to international markets, focusing on rock-bottom pricing. Temu becoming the top-ranked iPhone app in the U.S. highlights that even wealthy populations crave its unbeatable everyday value.\n\nDespite some post-pandemic wobbles, PDD stock boasts striking momentum \u2013 up 320% off its March 2022 bottom and 60% over the past year. Revenue rocketed 94% year-over-year in Q3, as the company blew away estimates by 28%. The company\u2019s 2023 earnings per share figure is set to double by 2026. And even at 2023 projections, shares trade at a digestible 24-times earnings, quite inexpensive for a Chinese internet giant growing this briskly.\n\nOnce Chinese sentiment rebounds, I expect this niche e-commerce juggernaut to regain its premium multiple as Wall Street remembers the immense long-term potential ahead. PDD looks poised to continue handsomely rewarding investors over the next decade.\n\nMitek Systems (MITK) A concept image of a person touching a hologram fingerprint\n\nSource: Alexander Supertramp/Shutterstock.com\n\nWith digital transformation accelerating across sectors, demand for user identity verification and transaction security solutions continues to expand rapidly. Yet many identity specialists trade at demanding valuations after strong runs. Mitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) presents an overlooked opportunity trading at just 11-times forward earnings, despite leadership in critical growth areas spanning fintech, deposits, and biometrics.\n\nMitek built the first mobile check deposit technology, which is now used by millions. This technological breakthrough has provided a deep competitive moat, which remains to this day.\n\nThe company\u2019s portfolio of solutions leverage proprietary AI and machine learning to enable secure user onboarding, identity corroboration, and transaction protection. High customer loyalty and a sticky revenue base provide ballast, while a recent management shakeup aims to unlock shareholder value.\n\nWhile pandemic pressures temporarily depressed fintech activity, Mitek appears poised to ride renewed momentum. Consensus forecasts call for steady, low double-digit earnings and revenue growth in the coming years. But with shares lagging peers and catalysts emerging, I believe 2024 could prove a breakout year for Mitek. This overlooked identity verification play has quietly built an enviable competitive position and trades at a reasonable valuation today, given its growth prospects over the next decade.\n\nZeta Global Holdings (ZETA) Robot hand touching fingertips with human hand through a screen. represents ai and machine learning stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nZeta\u2019s (NYSE:ZETA) integrated data-driven marketing platform leverages AI to equips brands to analyze consumer behavior, build higher-converting digital campaigns, and make ad spending more impactful.\n\nThough advertising demand volatility poses risks in the interim, Zeta\u2019s offerings could prove essential for businesses navigating fluid consumer patterns. The company\u2019s earnings per share are projected to nearly double from 32 cents in 2023 to 58 cents in 2025, alongside 17%-20% annual revenue growth. With 2022 losses of $279 million on $591 million in sales, profitability improvements are clearly a priority.\n\nImportantly, analysts expect revenue to reach $1 billion in 2025, accompanied by around $100 million in earnings. Trading at 32-times forward earnings and three times sales, Zeta looks underpriced to me, given its growth potential. As the company continues to execute, ZETA stock may hold substantial upside from today\u2019s levels.\n\nUiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile generative AI has grabbed headlines lately, robotic process automation leader UiPath (NYSE:PATH) continues making inroads in key areas of the economy. Essentially, UiPath empowers companies to automate repetitive workflows. UiPath does this by leveraging proprietary AI to help organizations boost efficiency, workplace productivity, cost savings, and customer satisfaction. Despite the vital role automation plays in enhancing enterprise agility, PATH stock currently trades nearly 68% off its 2021 highs.\n\nHowever, UiPath is quietly building impressive momentum on strong execution and technological differentiation. Integrating generative AI to ease automation development paired with over 10,000 enterprise customers and the potential for nearly $300 million in 2024 non-GAAP operating profits make UiPath an appealing turnaround candidate. With analysts potentially underestimating UiPath\u2019s profit potential based on its historical performance, I believe the stock looks attractively priced around 8-times 2024 projected earnings.\n\nThe automation wave remains in its early innings, and UiPath has cultivated defendable leadership after years of innovation. If execution remains consistent, UiPath appears positioned to ride renewed momentum on large, underpenetrated opportunities across SMBs and enterprises. Currently, PATH stock offers investors intriguing risk-reward upside. It\u2019s a stock I think is worth buying, for those who can stomach some volatility.\n\nFive9 (FIVN) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nFive9\u2019s (NASDAQ:FIVN) cloud contact center platform integrates voice, messaging, AI, analytics, and workforce optimization to transform legacy on-premise infrastructure. Trading range-bound for months, I expect FIVN stock to break out in 2024.\n\nThe company continues to gain market share in its key segments, powering enterprise contact center migration to the cloud. Profitability runways support significant equity upside even from current reasonable valuations. Indeed, Five9 holds tangible upside in my view if execution endures.\n\nIts solutions should only increase in strategic necessity as digital engagement expands. Five9 appears positioned to deliver significant rewards to patient investors from current prices. Specifically, the company\u2019s earnings per share are expected to double from 2023 to 2027 and then double again from 2027 to 2032. Revenue growth should be even faster, potentially reaching $4.5 billion by 2032. That\u2019s the kind of growth long-term investors should be after.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best Chinese stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on the Chinese economy, head over to 5 Best Chinese Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe Chinese economy, once expected to quickly recover in 2023 and continue as a global growth engine, has experienced a slowdown, being labeled a \"drag\" on world output by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Despite challenges like a property crisis, weak spending, and high youth unemployment, China achieved its official growth target of around 5% for 2023. However, this is below the pre-COVID annual growth average of 6%, and concerns are rising about 2024 and the possibility of decades of stagnation without significant market reforms. The risk of falling into the \"Middle Income Trap,\" where emerging economies struggle to reach high-income status, is highlighted by Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank.\n\nMajor international investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, anticipate a slower growth rate for China's economy in 2024 compared to the previous year. The average prediction among these banks suggests a 4.6% increase in real GDP for 2024, down from the expected 5.2% growth in 2023. According to Haibin Zhu, JPMorgan\u2019s Chief China Economist and Head of Greater China Economic Research, and his team:\n\n\u201cAn important task in 2024 is to manage the downside risk in the economy, particularly from the housing market correction and its spillover risks. Deflation pressure will likely fade in 2024, with the turnaround in global commodity prices and domestic pork prices, but low inflation will stay along with insufficient domestic demand.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed their views in their 2024 outlook:\n\n\u201cThe Chinese economy did not follow the script in 2023. Overall, we expect macro policy to ease notably [in 2024], particularly by the central government, in order to support the economy and to prevent real GDP growth from decelerating too much from 2023 to 2024.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nUBS analysts suggest that there is still room for growth in China, particularly in the continued migration of workers from rural to urban areas, along with investments in manufacturing, services, and renewable energy. Despite a growth rate of 3% to 4%, China's economic expansion continues to outpace that of developed economies.\n\nDuring the Lunar New Year holiday this year, China experienced a notable increase in travel activity and spending, surpassing levels seen before the pandemic. Ministry of Culture and Tourism data revealed a 34.3% year-over-year rise in domestic trips, reaching 474 million, and a 47.3% increase in spending on domestic holiday trips, amounting to nearly 632.7 billion yuan ($87.95 billion). China Central Television, citing the ministry, reported a 19% increase in domestic trips and a 7.7% rise in spending compared to the same period in 2019. This positive data is particularly significant as Chinese policymakers are actively working to stimulate domestic consumption amidst deflationary pressures. During the holidays, the Chinese mainland experienced 3.6 million tourist departures and 3.23 million tourist arrivals. Mutual visa-free travel agreements with certain countries contributed to the recovery in both outbound and inbound travel. The Lunar New Year is considered a crucial metric for assessing consumer appetite in China, being the country's most important holiday.\n\nIn its most recent monetary policy statement, the People's Bank of China reduced the benchmark 5-year loan prime rate by 25 basis points. Many analysts interpreted this action as an attempt to support the challenged property market in the country, given that a significant portion of mortgages is linked to this rate. A more stable housing sector is considered crucial for achieving overall economic stability.\n\nAmid the current challenges faced by the world's second-largest economy, it could be a good idea to buy Chinese stocks now to reap the rewards later. Some of the best Chinese stocks to buy include Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe chose the top Chinese stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Tiger Pacific Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.50 million shares worth $41.6 million.\n\nLike Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Kanzhun Limited (NASDAQ:BZ) is one of the best Chinese stocks to monitor.\n\n12. H World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\n\nH World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) is a company based in Shanghai, China, and its subsidiaries are involved in the development and operation of hotels. The company manages leased, owned, and franchised hotels across China, operating under brand names such as HanTing Hotel, Ni Hao Hotel, Hi Inn, and Elan Hotel, to name a few. H World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) is one of the best Chinese stocks to invest in.\n\nOn January 22, H World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) announced that its Legacy-Huazhu business experienced a RevPAR (revenue per available room) recovery in the fourth quarter of 2023, reaching 120% of the 2019 level. This rebound was fueled by the ongoing resurgence in both leisure and business travel demand.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 31 hedge funds were bullish on H World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter.\n\n11. Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\n\nLi Auto Inc.

The company plans to introduce a portfolio of eight competitive models, including four EREVs (extended-range electric vehicles) and four BEVs (battery electric vehicles), to meet evolving user demands. Additionally, the company aims to increase investment in research and development, focusing on autonomous driving, smart space, and smart electrification technologies.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, John Overdeck and David Siegel\u2019s Two Sigma Advisors is the largest stakeholder of Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), with 6.1 million shares worth $228.8 million. Overall, 31 hedge funds were bullish on the stock.\n\n10. Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nVipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS) operates online platforms in China, offering a wide range of products, including clothing, accessories, beauty products, home goods, and supermarket items. Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS) is one of the top Chinese stocks to consider buying.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, Citi upgraded Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS) stock from Neutral to Buy, driven by the company's Q3 performance and management's positive outlook for 2024. The price target was increased from $18 to $20. Analyst Alicia Yap acknowledged that Vipshop's Q3 results surpassed both Citi and Wall Street estimates, despite Q4 estimates being lower than anticipated. However, the optimistic outlook for 2024 is based on Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS)\u2019s potential for expanding its user base, enhancing merchandise selection, and maintaining operational efficiency, which is expected to contribute to a gradual improvement in margin and profit.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 32 hedge funds held stakes in Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS), compared to 30 funds in the last quarter. William B. Gray\u2019s Orbis Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.90 million shares worth $87 million.\n\nHere is what Oakmark Fund has to say about Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\n\n\u201cVipshop Holdings ADR (China) offers a differentiated value proposition to its customers via its online product sales and distributions services. We like that the business model is asset-light due to inventory being predominantly on consignment and logistics outsourced to a third party. We believe the company should generate meaningful free cash flow moving forward.\u201d\n\n9. TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nTAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL), based in Beijing, China, specializes in providing after-school tutoring services for K-12 students. On January 25, JP Morgan upgraded TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) stock from Neutral to Overweight, expressing strong optimism about the company's fast growth prospects. The bank raised the price target from $10 to $15. This upgrade is influenced by a positive trend in the tutoring business, following strong performance and guidance from New Oriental Education for the November quarter. JP Morgan analysts anticipate TAL's exceptional growth to continue, raising revenue forecasts for the next three years by an average of 30%, reaching Street highs. The analysts believe TAL's supernormal growth has become the new normal, and the company's earnings power is expected to surprise the market for years to come.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 32 hedge funds were long TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nHere is what Tao Value has to say about TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLooking at the value destruction, TAL Education (TAL) is one of the most painful losses. Although the company is part of the \u201cMindful Compounder\u201d bucket, it impaired by 95%. If anything, it is a heavy price paid for learning that stock returns are driven by more than business and market factors, but also societal factors. I personally think having 4 out of the 5 top value destructions being recently started position in Chinese stocks is a bit biased, as the market may have overreacted the most to anything China-related recently.\u201d\n\n8. NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\n\nNext on our list of the best Chinese stocks is NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), an operator of online businesses including games, music streaming, intelligent learning services, and internet content services in China and globally. On November 16, NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPADS of $1.84, beating Wall Street estimates by $0.37. The revenue increased 11.6% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. However, it fell short of market consensus by $80 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 36 hedge funds were bullish on NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), compared to 25 funds in the last quarter. Larry Chen and Terry Zhang\u2019s Tairen Capital is the leading position holder in the company, with 1.76 million shares worth $164.3 million.\n\n7. New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\n\nNew Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) provides private educational services in China under the New Oriental brand. New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc.

It is one of the best Chinese stocks to invest in.\n\nOn January 24, New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) reported earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.

(NYSE:EDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added a new investment position inNew Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU), a leading after school tutoring program in China. Although the Chinese government banned K-12 academic after school tutoring, the company was able to leverage its expertise in course content quality control and standardized tutoring processes to quickly reposition itself as a leader of non-academic after school tutoring. Furthermore, we anticipate the company\u2019s strong brand and the entrepreneurial acumen of its founder, Michael Yu, will create additional opportunities for expansion as a comprehensive educational service provider.\u201d\n\n6. KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\n\nKE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE) operates an integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services in China. The company, founded in 2001 and headquartered in Beijing, operates through four segments \u2013 Existing Home Transaction Services, New Home Transaction Services, Home Renovation and Furnishing, and Emerging and Other Services.\n\nKE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE) expects total net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 to range from RMB18.0 billion ($2.47 billion) to RMB18.5 billion ($2.54 billion). This projection reflects an estimated growth of approximately 7.5% to 10.5% compared to the same quarter in 2022. The forecast takes into account the potential influence of recent real estate-related policies and measures, the effects of which remain uncertain and may impact the company's operations.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 39 hedge funds were bullish on KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE), compared to 37 funds in the last quarter. Lei Zhang\u2019s Hillhouse Capital Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $473.7 million.\n\nIn addition to Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), JD.com, Inc.

(NYSE:BEKE) ranks 6th on our list of the best Chinese stocks.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund made the following comment about KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBottom contributors to performance for the quarter included real estate platform KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE). Beike fell due to weaker industry property sales in China in April following the release of strong pent-up demand in Q1, despite accelerating revenue and very modest cost growth.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Chinese Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Gold Mining Companies to Invest In According to Analysts 10 Best Car Insurance in Massachusetts for 2024 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a013 Best Chinese Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Retail stocks are poised for transformation as artificial intelligence (AI) redefines shopping. AI is at the forefront of innovation in the retail sphere, elevating the consumer experience by personalizing marketing. For investors, this spells opportunity.\n\nIntegrating AI in retail, from optimizing prices to automating inventory management, is a seismic shift that will likely reshape the industry\u2019s future. Early adopters in the retail sphere are poised to reap the rewards, adding new layers to their growth stories.\n\nAccording to a report from MarketDigits, the global AI in retail market will skyrocket from $7.3 billion in 2023 to an expected $51.5 billion by 2030. Hence, this burgeoning field presents a wealth of opportunity, making it a cornerstone for growth-focused portfolios. Here are three companies on the forefront of retail innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) foray into generative AI marks a major pivot poised to redefine ecommerce innovation. By integrating cutting-edge AI across its vast ecommerce platform and Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon is taking things up a notch. The launch of Amazon Bedrock heralds a new era for developers as the platform streamlines and enriches the diverse capabilities of foundational models from top AI players.\n\nFurthermore, incorporating Amazon Titan Embeddings and Meta\u2019s Llama 2 models into Bedrock offers a palette of choices for users. Amazon CodeWhisperer\u2019s AI-powered code suggestions offer improved efficiency for coders as it provides an internal codebase to amplify developer productivity. Additionally, a new large language model now gives a more human-like cadence to Alexa, responding in an intuitive conversational style.\n\nAll of these ways that Amazon is layering AI into its operations adds another feather to its proverbial cap. These new implementations of AI technology are expected to produce a more customer-friendly environment. That should hopefully translate to additional sales, making AMZN one of the most innovative retail stocks available right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a large tan Walmart store front on a bright clear day with empty handicap parking spaces, trees, bushes, and blue poles in front and a large white \"Walmart\" sign and logo with six yellow lines forming a circle above the entrance.\n\nSource: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart\u2019s (NYSE:WMT) success story continues to impress as it adds new dimensions to its business with a smart blend of ecommerce, international market penetration and a growing advertising revenue stream. The retail behemoth\u2019s investment in AI is a masterstroke, set to reap dividends across its global operations. As Walmart weaves AI into the fabric of its customer experience, it\u2019s creating an interactive shopping environment marked by features such as voice shopping and text-to-shop.\n\nFurthermore, the company is enhancing its digital platforms with AI-driven search functions that effectively interpret the context of customer inquiries and deliver personalized shopping experiences. This innovative new approach allows customers to accomplish complex shopping goals effortlessly. Providing easier ways for customers to buy more products is a key goal of retail stocks right now, and Walmart is succeeding at that through the use of this tool.\n\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s AI transformation extends to its backend processes as WMT looks to create a more responsive supply chain. Walmart is also inviting its workforce to pitch AI solutions, fostering a culture of innovation and employee satisfaction. These approaches position Walmart as a beacon of retail\u2019s AI-driven future, making its retail stock a rewarding prospect for the long haul.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Computer and smartphone with Alibaba (BABA) logo\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) vast ecosystem is a marvel of synergy. It effectively leverages payment platforms, logistics and cloud capabilities to form an ecommerce titan. With its investments in generative AI, Alibaba is not just elevating its platform but redefining the tech sphere. Integrating AI into its services promises a user experience like none other and a major surge in growth, positioning Alibaba as a leader in innovation.\n\nThe strategic deployment of generative AI across Alibaba\u2019s suite significantly enhances user interactions and operational fluidity. With its large language model, Tongyi Qianwen, Alibaba is pioneering content creation and productivity. From corporate communications on DingTalk to personalized experiences with the Tmall Genie voice assistant, Tongyi Qianwen is a game changer.\n\nAdditionally, Alibaba Cloud extends this AI prowess to its clients, offering industry-specific AI model development. Alibaba\u2019s continued development of services and products that utilize generative AI highlights its clear commitment to maintaining its competitive edge. BABA is consistently on the list of retail stocks to watch, and with its increased investment in AI technology, investors will benefit by keeping it on their radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "3 Cloud Stocks to Buy for Multibagger Gains This Decade",
        "content": "Cloud computing has been one of the most disruptive technological shifts of the past decade. As companies continue migrating more workloads to the cloud, some of the top cloud infrastructure and platform providers have seen tremendous growth. I believe cloud stocks still have legs for the 2020s, fueled by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.\n\nJust look at the eye-popping demo of OpenAI\u2019s new Sora video generator model if you want proof. We\u2019re entering an age where AI can create photorealistic videos from simple text prompts. As these generative AI models become commercially viable in the cloud, they could enable new use cases we can\u2019t even imagine yet. As a result, more investor cash may pour into the AI industry, which would provide tailwinds for leading cloud providers powering these models.\n\nEven without AI, growth remains strong, with global cloud spending expected to grow at 15-20% annually this decade. Companies\u2019 reliance on cloud infrastructure expands as they embrace data-intensive digital transformation initiatives. This sets up some cloud stocks to potentially deliver multibagger returns over the next few years. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Computer and smartphone with Alibaba (BABA) logo\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut, but it also provides cloud services through Alibaba Cloud. Offerings include ClusterOps for cloud-native environment management and Elasticsearch for search and analytics. BABA stock has struggled amid a weak Chinese market and economic uncertainty, but I believe the bleeding has stopped. Business execution remains solid, the Chinese economy may be nearing a bottom and valuations look highly attractive.\n\nIn its recent quarter, Alibaba generated $36.7 billion in revenue, up 5% annually. Not wildly impressive growth, but BABA trades at just 8x earnings and 1.4x sales \u2014 it seems deeply undervalued, given expectations for continued mid-single-digit top-line expansion and strong profitability. Sentiment has sunk, but I expect a strong rebound once negativity around China dissipates.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Alibaba reported, all six business segments saw increasing revenue, with four segments remaining profitable. China faces economic headwinds, but we may be approaching a bottom. With its intrinsic value far surpassing its deflated stock price, Alibaba looks like one of the most compelling cloud stocks today. If sentiment improves even slightly, the stock could stage a powerful recovery.\n\nDocuSign (DOCU) Closeup of the DocuSign (DOCU) inbox page seen on a MacBook computer. DocuSign helps organizations connect and automate how they prepare, sign, act on and manage agreements.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile many view DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) as a \u201cpandemic darling,\u201d its Agreement Cloud platform has staying power. The suite includes 12+ apps and APIs for e-signatures, document generation, contract lifecycle management and more. Despite trading 23% below pre-pandemic highs, DOCU has $1.6 billion in cash versus $835 million in debt \u2013 a strong financial position.\n\nYes, slowing revenue growth is a valid concern. However, I expect reacceleration once e-signatures become more commonplace. Fortune Business Insights report projects a 35% CAGR for the global digital signature market through 2030, valuing it at $43 billion. As businesses continue adopting modern agreement solutions, DocuSign stands ready to capitalize, given its #1 market share position globally.\n\nAs its CEO noted in its Q3 earnings call:\n\nThis is solid growth among cloud stocks, and that gives me a lot of conviction.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock has done well recently amid AI hype \u2014 the company has infused offerings like Photoshop with new AI capabilities. However, shares sank last week on OpenAI\u2019s video-generation model announcement. I view the sell-off as irrational and another buying opportunity.\n\nRather than threaten Adobe, I believe OpenAI\u2019s innovations will prove complementary. The firms have partnered previously, and Adobe could utilize models like Sora to enhance its own editing software. Combined with After Effects, for example, Sora could enable breakthrough video creation tools.\n\nFinancially, Adobe saw Q4 revenue climb 11.6% to $5 billion as net income surged 26.1% to nearly $1.5 billion. Yes, the business trades at a premium \u2014 but for good reason. Over 94% of revenue comes via sticky subscriptions, the company holds deep competitive moats and TAM remains enormous across creative, document and marketing software.\n\nSustained double-digit growth could justify a premium valuation. Adobe operates in a recession-resistant industry. Even with slowing expansion over time, I see a visible path for the stock to deliver multibagger returns over the long run. Upside drivers include continued cloud migration, operating leverage and emerging technologies like AI/ML.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Nasdaq is currently sitting at all-time highs. Thus, there\u2019s no shortage of high-priced tech stocks at the moment. While it\u2019s easy to find tech shares that are high priced, finding untapped gems becomes that much harder.\n\nTech stocks have soared over the past year as the artificial intelligence era begins. The Magnificent 7 have been the primary beneficiaries of that boom. Their success has pulled up many other tech stocks. However, there are plenty of hidden gems yet to be discovered along with some better known big name firms.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at seven tech stocks that appear to be oversold values currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors continue to be bearish about Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock in early 2024. What was once one of the highest flying Chinese tech stocks is now a little more than a contrarian pick. Well, that\u2019s the prevailing market wisdom regarding the e-commerce giant. It\u2019s also wisdom that investors should ignore.\n\nThe Chinese stock market continues to be historically weak. In fact, ETfs Tracking country performance are at Lowe\u2019s last tested in 2011. Investors aren\u2019t particularly keen on Chinese Equity at the moment overall. That said, certain e-commerce competitors of Alibaba, namely PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), look strong primarily due to Temu.\n\nThat has made Alibaba and its shares look even weaker as investors wonder whether it\u2019s time as China\u2019s e-commerce Champion is a thing of the past. That has yet to be determined. What is known at the moment is that Alibaba\u2019s revenues grew by 5% in the most recent quarter.\n\nIt remains the leading cloud firm in China. Those factors have started to sway sentiment with several big names establishing positions in Alibaba. The tide is turning in Alibaba\u2019s favor and now is the time to get on board.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe semiconductor sector is heating up, making Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER)\u00a0one of the tech stocks primed for a breakout.\n\nStory continues\n\nBullishness pervades the sector following news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) that it expects sales to increase by 20% in 2024. Teradyne produces testing equipment vital to the industry and it should be pulled up because of the news.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what one would expect. However, Teradyne continues to face a downturn. Its most recent earnings showed revenues declined by 8%. The company continues to forecast weak demand. The reason is simple: market uncertainty. Firms simply don\u2019t have the confidence to assume that the economy will continue to improve. Thus, they are holding back on chip testing equipment purchases for the moment.\n\nWhat then should give investors any reason to establish a contrarian position?\u00a0 One of the strongest reasons is that Teradyne may have a big opportunity in the US. The company pulled $1 billion worth of equipment out of China due to export controls in 2023. TSM strongly believes that the US chip sector will grow in 2024. Teradyne can make up those losses by pivoting into US strength.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) provides integrated circuits, more specifically, microcontrollers and microprocessors.\n\nBoth types of chips contain CPUs with microcontrollers also including memory and power on one integrated chip. That overly technical explanation aside, Microchip Technology is a stock worth considering.\n\nThe company is extremely profitable with Margins and Returns on assets and Equity that outpace roughly 95% of competitors in the semiconductor sector. Despite the company\u2019s strong performance, it continues to trade more cheaply than 65% of its competitors based on its price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe company also released a security oriented chip in late 2023 which makes it more relevant overall. firms everywhere are increasingly concerned about security issues in the AI era. Demand for increased security and connected devices is unsurprisingly increasing because of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company is looking to rebound in 2024 on weaker sales. It is attempting to do so through share buybacks and dividend payouts which is another reason to consider it.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors don\u2019t have to dig deep to find a reason STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM)\u00a0stock remains undervalued.\n\nOne of STMicroelectronics primary revenue generators is the sale of chips to automotive manufacturers and the broader automotive industry. A big reason then for its current troubles is simply that the electric vehicle industry is going through a downturn. EVs require many more chips than do their internal combustion counterparts, thus resulting in trouble for STMicroelectronics.\n\nThere\u2019s a belief that STMicroelectronics is oversold because of skepticism about the EV sector\u2019s recovery. Sales growth is anticipated to continue to slow in 2024 as the sector attempts to move from the early adopter phase into the mass market.\n\nYet, newer chemistries will continue to drive down the costs of battery production. In turn, that could galvanize a resurgence in growth. Whether or not factors become more positive in 2024 remains to be seen.\n\nSTMicroelectronics should keep growing and will break out sooner or later as the tide around electric vehicles shifts again.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock increased in price dramatically following news that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has invested in the firm.\n\nNvidia disclosed that it has invested $3.7 million in the company which engages in conversational AI development. It was among the smaller investments Nvidia made with a $76 million investment in a biotech firm and a $147.3 million investment in Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM).\n\nDespite its relatively small size, the disclosure of the investment served to raise SoundHound AI\u2019s share price by more than 60%.\n\nThe best time to have been invested in SoundHound AI was clearly prior to the disclosure of the news. Yet, it continues to be a sound investment and is among the leading names in conversational AI. Nvidia\u2019s investment in SoundHound AI strongly suggests that it believes the firm is the leading company in the emergent space.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) A Cisco (CSCO) sign outside of a building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)Is another very well known Tech stock to investors. Thus, it\u2019s hard to characterize it as being untapped. further, the company is going through a restructuring that will result in headcount declining by 5%.\n\nThe company is dealing with a glut of inventory at the companies it serves. It will take time for those buyers to work through inventory, which will slow down sales at the company. That news sets the stage for a few positive things to happen.\n\nMany companies have moved higher because of restructuring over the past year. It is entirely possible that the markets receive the news positively. Labor costs are the highest expense for firms and in that regard, Cisco Systems just improved.\n\nAnother reason to buy Cisco Systems now is the potential for higher dividend yields if shares keep falling. With a dividend yield of over 3%, it\u2019s a strong income choice among tech stocks. The bargain is improving, another reason to consider Cisco Systems now.\n\nGlobal Payments (GPN) Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) Is a fintech stock with momentum on its side. The Atlanta-based company just released earnings which were overall quite positive.\n\nRevenues increased by 8%, reaching $2.43 billion in the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings increased by 50% during the same period and the company\u2019s operating margin increased by 2.4%. Clearly there\u2019s a lot to like. The strong results are one of the primary reasons that share prices have increased from $127 to $137 year to date.\n\nCFO Josh Whipple noted that the company\u2019s outlook for 2024 continues to foresee strong momentum though it has been tempered by recent economic uncertainty. That was a nod to headline inflation numbers which continue to confound economists.\n\nRegardless, the fintech opportunity continues to be strong as the traditional finance and banking sector further digitizes in 2024 and beyond. Income investors will also appreciate the fact that Global Payments includes a dividend. That dividend yields a modest 0.75% that will add up over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Chinese artificial intelligencestart-up Moonshot AI has raised more than US$1 billion in a new funding round led by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and venture capital firm HongShan, as interest among investors remains high for innovative mainland enterprises similar to ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nBeijing-based Moonshot AI, known in Chinese as Yuezhi Anmian, was valued at about US$2.5 billion in its latest funding round, according to separate reports published on Monday by local media 36Kr and LatePost. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nHongShan, the Chinese spin-off of US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and angel investor ZhenFund were involved in Moonshot AI's seed funding last June, according to market intelligence platform PitchBook.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe start-up in October launched smart chatbot Kimi Chat, built on its self-developed Moonshot large language model (LLM), which can process as many as 200,000 Chinese characters in a context window - referring to the swathe of text that an AI model can process during conversation with users.\n\nA screenshot of smart chatbot Kimi Chat. Photo: Moonshot AI alt=A screenshot of smart chatbot Kimi Chat. Photo: Moonshot AI>\n\nAlibaba, HongShan and Moonshot AI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nMoonshot AI's new funding round marked the largest single financing raised by a Chinese AI start-up since ChatGPT was released in November 2022.\n\nThe latest investment recorded by Moonshot AI showed that interest in generative AI start-ups remains strong in mainland China, which led global investments into such firms in the first half of 2023.\n\nChina had the most number of generative AI start-ups that received funding at the time, according to a report by AI-focused research firm Zhidongxi. The mainland accounted for 22 of the 51 such start-ups around the world that raised about US$13.8 billion in investments during the period.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoonshot AI was founded in April 2023 by Yang Zhilin, a computer science graduate from Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University. He later received his doctoral degree in the US from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn an industry event last November, Yang said that the ability to process long texts is critical to the future development of existing AI models.\n\nAn LLM's capability partly hinges on its number of parameters, a measure of the sophistication of an AI model. While ChatGPT was trained on 175 billion parameters, the Moonshot LLM has more than 100 billion parameters, according to local media reports.\n\nBaichuan, the AI venture established by Sogou founder Wang Xiaochuan, already launched last year an iteration of its proprietary LLM - the technology used to train generative AI services like ChatGPT - that can handle around 350,000 Chinese characters in a context window.\n\nAlso based in Beijing, Baichuan claimed at the time that its Baichuan2-192k LLM had surpassed Claude 2, the AI model of Amazon.com-backed Anthropic, as the world's most advanced LLM in terms of the number of words that users could include in their chat queries. Claude 2's context window was said to be capable of scrutinising around 75,000 English words, equivalent to hundreds of pages of documents or a thick book.\n\nMainland China had 254 LLMs as of November, according to a white paper published by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\nThe launch of various domestic LLMs, however, has been criticised by Baidu founder, chairman and chief executive Robin Li Yanhong as a \"huge of waste of resources\". At an event in Shenzhen last November, Li said there were too many LLMs in China, \"but too few AI-native applications based on those models\".\n\nMeanwhile, Moonshot AI might somehow have to contend with another start-up named Moonshot AI that is based in New York City. This US firm, according to its website, provides an AI platform that helps e-commerce stores fully automate their online operations to increase conversions, sales and revenue.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "No Clear Sign of a Turnaround for Alibaba",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024 on Feb. 7. Earnings beat estimates and the company announced another $25 billion share buyback program on top of the previously announced $50 billion share repurchase program. Alibaba's shares fell 6% after reporting results.\n\nCEO Eddie Wu seemed to be very pleased with the quarterly results. In the earnings release, he said the following:\n\nWe delivered a solid quarter as we are executing our focused strategies across the organization. Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up investment to improve users' core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen market leadership in the coming year. We will also focus our resources on developing public cloud products and sustaining the strong growth momentum in international commerce business.\n\nObviously investors did not agree with him.\n\nEarnings summary\n\nFor the quarter, Alibaba's revenue increased 5% year over year and adjusted Ebitda grew 2%. Non-GAAP net income decreased 4% year over year, while net cash provided by operating activities declined 26% and free cash flow fell 31%. From a financial standpoint, the quality of Alibaba's revenue growth this quarter was very low because profitability declined.\n\nSegment results\n\nAlibaba's segment results are as follows: No Clear Sign of a Turnaround for Alibaba\n\nOn a segment basis, the International commerce retail business was the best-performing unit with an impressive 56% growth rate year over year. According to the press release, the sales increase was the result of solid combined order growth in AIDC's retail businesses, \"driven by the strong performance of all its major retail platforms, the revenue contribution from AliExpress Choice as well as improvements in monetization.Although the AIDC segment's growth has been strong, it has yet to make money because of continued investments in the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Cainiao Smart Logistics segment also experienced healthy revenue growth of 24% year over year, which was attribued to a sales increase from cross-border fulfillment solutions. On top of the healthy revenue growth, Cainiao has finally started making profits for Alibaba due to cost-optimization efforts and economy of scale. During the quarter, Cainiao's adjusted Ebita was 961 million yuan ($135.03 million), compared to a loss of 12 million yuan in the same quarter last year. This is certainly good news for the company.\n\nRevenue from the cloud business grew 3% year over year. However, excluding Alibaba-consolidated businesses, the revenue for the cloud business actually decreased year over year because the company continued to cut low-margin project-based contracts. On the other hand, revenue from public cloud products and services recorded healthy growth.Overall, revenue from Alibaba's cloud business was in line with expectations.\n\nTurning to Aliaba's most important business, the Taobao and TMall Group, revenue growth was only 2% for the quarter. Worse yet, the higher-margin customer management or the ads commission business was flat compared to last year. Although order volume and gross merchandise volume grew during the quarter, both average order value and take rate declined. I will note here that Taobao and TMall Group's revenue growth was slower than China's retail growth during the same period. This tells me both Taobao and TMall Group are still rapidly losing market share to Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) and Bytedance's Douyin even though management has taken dramatic steps to address the competition issue. I think this is the key issue for Alibaba.\n\nAlibaba's management outlined the strategy to turn around the business, which is in line with the previously announced strategy:\n\nWe are in the process of revitalizing Taobao and Tmall Group and positioning it for future growth. Our growth strategy is to put users first, build ecosystem for brands and merchants to thrive on our platform, and realize technology-driven innovation. We are committed to building an e-commerce ecosystem where brands, merchants and manufacturers operate with high efficiency, thereby providing multi-tiered Chinese consumers with good products and services at attractive prices. In December 2023, we appointed a new management team to execute Taobao and Tmall Group's strategy and drive business growth through technological innovation.\n\nThe problem with the strategy is it does not address the company's core competitive disadvantage against Pinduoduo, which is its cost disadvantage and its centralized merchants system. So far, management has not done enough to address these two disadvantages.\n\nThoughts on Alibaba's share buyback program\n\nAlong with the earnings release, Alibaba announced another $25 billion share buyback program on top of the previously announced $50 billion repurchase program. The company's massive share buyback program is the largest among Chinese tech companies and one of the largest share buyback programs ever announced of all public companies. While I applaud management's efforts, I think the company should think about paying more dividends to shareholders as opposed to merely increasing share buybacks because Alibaba's intrinsic value may decline in the future. If its intrinsic value does decline in the future, a cash dividend is a better option for shareholders compared to share repurchases.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlibaba's international and logistic businesses have experienced healthy growth for the past several quarters. Its cloud business is gradually recovering from the price war in the low-margin segment. However, its core China e-commerce business is still in trouble and there has been no clear sign of a turnaround. Without signs of improvement, it is not clear whether Alibaba is undervalued or not.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Wall Street Thinks These 3 Stocks Are Hidden Gems That Could Soar 43% to 59% Over the Next 12 Months",
        "content": "Some stocks seem to hog the limelight, and that's understandable, to some extent. After all, stocks that have been at the forefront of the hottest trends and delivered tremendous gains arguably deserve greater attention than others.\n\nHowever, this also means that investors can find great opportunities with stocks that aren't at the center of attention. Wall Street thinks these three stocks are hidden gems that could soar 43% to 59% higher over the next 12 months.\n\n1. SLB\n\nSLB (NYSE: SLB), previously known as Schlumberger, ranks as one of the world's largest technology companies serving the oil and gas industry. It offers digital and integration solutions, reservoir performance technologies, well construction services, and production-system technologies.\n\nWhile the overall stock market has boomed over the last 12 months, SLB has been a bust. Its shares are down more than 15%, with plenty of up-and-down swings.\n\nThe decline has made SLB quite cheap. The stock's forward earnings multiple is below 13.5x. Wall Street is bullish about it, too, with the consensus 12-month price target reflecting an upside potential of 43%.\n\nSLB's underlying business appears to be on solid ground. The company's revenue increased by 14% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023, with adjusted earnings soaring 21%. CEO Olivier Le Peuch predicted in the Q4 update that SLB will enjoy \"another year of strong growth\" in 2024, with international markets especially providing a catalyst.\n\n2. Alibaba Group Holding\n\nAlibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA) is one of the biggest Chinese technology companies. It runs a popular e-commerce platform, operates a global logistics network, is a major cloud services provider, and distributes mobile games and movies.\n\nAlthough Alibaba was a hot stock from its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014 through late 2020, it's been a different story since then. Concerns about the Chinese economy have weighed heavily on the stock, which is now down more than 75% below its peak and 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts see a big opportunity with this steep pullback, though. Of the 48 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February, all but one rated the stock as a buy or a strong buy. The average 12-month price target for Alibaba is nearly 56% above the current share price. Shares also appear to be dirt cheap, trading at only 7.8x forward earnings.\n\nAlibaba thinks its stock is attractive, too. The company's board of directors recently approved a huge increase of $25 billion to its stock buyback program. Alibaba now has more than $35 billion to spend on share repurchases over the next three fiscal years.\n\n3. Royalty Pharma\n\nRoyalty Pharma(NASDAQ: RPRX) is no doubt the least familiar of these three stocks for many investors. It buys royalties for biopharmaceutical products and provides funding to biopharmaceutical companies. Royalty Pharma owns royalties on over 35 approved products, notably including Vertex Pharmaceuticals'\u00a0cystic fibrosis drugs and blood cancer drug Imbruvica, which is marketed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nLike SLB and Alibaba, Royalty Pharma has been a loser for investors over the last 12 months. Its shares have fallen more than 20% as the company's royalty income has declined year over year.\n\nHowever, Wall Street expects a big rebound for Royalty Pharma. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of nearly 59%. All seven of the analysts recently surveyed by LSEG rate Royalty Pharma as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nRoyalty Pharma's management remains optimistic, as well. The company expects to generate a double-digit percentage compound annual growth rate for adjusted cash receipts this decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Royalty Pharma Plc right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Royalty Pharma Plc, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Royalty Pharma Plc wasn\u2019t one of them.

In case you want to skip our detailed analysis on the E-commerce industry, and discussion over Shopify\u2019s success story, you can go directly to 5 Popular Brands That Use Shopify.\n\nThe E-commerce Industry\n\nThe e-commerce industry has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, both globally and in the United States. Internationally, the market value surpassed $6 trillion in 2023 and is projected to reach $6.9 trillion in 2024, followed by an estimated $8.2 trillion by the end of 2026. With a current worldwide digital buyer count of 2.64 billion, the e-commerce penetration rate is expected to rise from 19% in 2022 to 25% by 2027.\n\nAs for the US market, it currently stands as the second most successful for e-commerce sales. The e-commerce penetration rate in the US has doubled between 2020 and 2023, reaching an overall rate of 35%. Major e-commerce marketplaces in the US include Amazon, eBay, Wish, Target, and Etsy. In 2023, US online sales reached $1.137 trillion, with an expected steady growth rate of at least 10% annually until 2027. Approximately 70% of Americans engage in online shopping, with the digital buyer count expected to reach 285 million by 2025.\n\nThe top e-commerce product categories in the US are consumer electronics, apparel, furniture, home decor, auto parts, and personal care products. Online shopping is growing rapidly in the recent times, and market projections foresee significant revenue growth in the coming years. Looking into 2024, trends such as AI-generated text, augmented reality, predictive analytics, personalization, self-service, same-day delivery, and improved returns management will shape the e-commerce industry as it strives to meet evolving consumer demands.\n\nFrom Startup to Success: Tracing Shopify's Journey in the E-commerce World\n\nIn this rapidly changing landscape, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), founded in 2006 in Ottawa, Canada, stands out as a user-friendly e-commerce platform that helps small businesses build and manage their online stores. With its streamlined dashboard and seamless integration with various sales channels, Shopify offers a comprehensive solution for entrepreneurs aiming to establish their brand in the digital marketplace. Merchants can create a modern online store and sell across social media platforms, blogs, websites, and other channels.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Shopify caters to in-person selling with its built-in point-of-sale (POS) system, ensuring smooth transactions and a seamless customer experience. As a subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) sales platform, Shopify provides flexibility through different store subscription plans, including a budget-friendly \"Lite\" plan. These plans offer a branded online store, versatile selling tools, and a range of business management features. With its competitive fees, secure technology, in-person sales integration, built-in product sourcing, and email marketing capabilities, Shopify offers immense value and unlimited growth potential. It's no wonder that many influential brands have chosen Shopify as their preferred platform. Whether starting out or ready for expansion, Shopify equips businesses with the tools needed to thrive in the world of e-commerce.\n\nIt is one of the leading E-commerce platforms globally, ranking 4th among the top 5, which is the reason why many popular brands use Shopify. It holds a significant market share of almost 11% in the global e-commerce tech market. Notably, 16% of Amazon sellers choose Shopify, highlighting its popularity among businesses.\n\nIn the USA, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is recognized as one of the top 5 SaaS companies and owns a 28% market share in the e-commerce platform market. The majority of Shopify stores, around 62.21%, are based in the United States, making North America its largest market. It is noted that fashion merchants heavily rely on Shopify services, with over 500,000 apparel online stores built on its e-commerce platforms, as of June 2023; the second most popular category on Shopify being home and garden, with approximately 220,000 stores.\n\nWhile Shopify competes with other hosting providers like WooCommerce, a comparison indicated that although WooCommerce has a strong overall presence, it is less utilized among the top 10,000 and 100,000 most visited sites worldwide. Also, in terms of payment technologies, Shopify accounts for nearly 14% of the worldwide market of online payment processing technologies. This places Shopify in third position, trailing behind PayPal and Stripe.\n\nFurthermore, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has made significant efforts to streamline its operations and reduce costs over the past year, making its future promising. These measures have proven successful, with Shopify achieving an operating income margin of 13% and a free cash flow margin of 21% in Q4 2023. Notably, 2023 Q4 marked a milestone for the company, as it recorded its highest-ever revenue and gross profit, reaching $2.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. During the earnings call, CFO Jeff Hoffmeister attributed the Q4 outperformance to record-breaking sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, a robust holiday season, increased payment penetration, and a growing number of merchants utilizing Shopify's platform.\n\nBefore delving into our list of 20 Popular Brands that Use Shopify, let\u2019s first take a look at the current happenings within the e-commerce industry\u2019, specifically looking at two giants: Amazon.com, Inc. (NasdaqGS:AMZN) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq:AMZN)\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023 ending 31 December, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) achieved significant growth in net sales. Sales increased by 14% to reach $170.0 billion compared to the same quarter in 2022. The North America segment experienced a 13% boost in sales, reaching $105.5 billion in the 2023 quarter; international sales also saw substantial growth, increasing by 17% to $40.2 billion. This is on the back of the holiday season during which Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) held a record-breaking Black Friday and Cyber Monday event, with customers worldwide purchasing over 1 billion items and enjoying substantial savings. These results signify Amazon's strong customer engagement and growth across multiple business segments.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nAlibaba is a prominent e-commerce company with a growth strategy revolving around prioritizing users, establishing an ecosystem that fosters growth for brands and merchants, and driving technology-driven innovation.\n\nIt reported revenue of US$36,669 million for 2023 quarter ending 31 December, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. However, income from operations saw a significant decline of 36% year-over-year, to US$3,171 million. This decrease was primarily due to impairment of intangible assets and goodwill related to Sun Art and Youku. Net income also declined by 77% year-over-year, reaching US$1,509 million in the same quarter, mainly attributed to mark-to-market changes in equity investments and the decrease in income from operations mentioned earlier. 20 Popular Brands That Use Shopify\n\nA portfolio manager analyzing the B2B e-commerce trends of the company on a tablet.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the Top 20 Popular Brands That Use Shopify, we conducted extensive research on the internet.

        "title": "20 Fastest Growing E-Commerce Companies in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 fastest growing e-commerce companies in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the global e-commerce industry and the latest developments, then you can skip ahead and take a look at 5 Fastest Growing E-Commerce Companies in 2024.\n\nFrom the late 1990s and the dotcom era to the first quarter of 2024, e-commerce, which is an industry based on letting buyers order goods from the comfort of their homes, has grown right alongside the Internet. The sector, which was initially started out by the San Jose, California based retailer eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) allowing people to sell their products online, has made the founder and shareholder of the Seattle, Washington based behemoth Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) one of the richest people in the world.\n\nHowever, while Amazon's market value also reflects its presence in the highly lucrative data center, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence markets, today's eCommerce industry is also populated by more players than were present when Amazon was a pureplay bookseller. Now, apart from other behemoths like the Chinese Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), other firms such as the Singaporean Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) offer eCommerce investors exposure to the broader global markets.\n\nTherefore, when it comes to growth, behemoths like Amazon and Alibaba are left in the dust while other companies are able to capitalize on underserved markets and build a stable footing. Markets, such as Asia Pacific in particular, have seen strong activity by young and vibrant eCommerce firms that benefit from the fact that they can target a region that houses most of the world's population.\n\nSo, the next step to ask in our brief overview of the global eCommerce industry, a sector that some estimates suggest is worth as much as a whopping $4.921 trillion, is which companies serve high growth regions. After all, estimates suggest that the People's Republic of China will remain the world's biggest eCommerce market for the next couple of years, and along with China, other Asian countries will continue to exhibit growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nA cursory look at eCommerce stocks shows that publicly traded companies based out of China, Singapore, Argentina, and South Korea reign supreme when it comes to investor optimism. Apart from Singaporean Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), some big ticket ex-US e-commerce names are Rakuten Group, Inc. (TYO:4755.T), Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI).\n\nDelving deeper into the global e-commerce industry and the performance of the top players, the sector as a whole has had to struggle with high inflation. While big ticket names such as Amazon and Alibaba are reaping the benefits of being able to diversify their revenues into high growth sectors like artificial intelligence and data center computing, more pureplay eCommerce companies are left to the whims of their customers who might find rising inflation a pinch to their wallets.\n\nTaking a look at Sea Limited's recent quarterly earnings performance shows that the firm has managed to beat analyst EPS estimates in just two out of its four latest quarters. Singapore after all is the fourth wealthiest country in the world when ranked by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and while this means that the country's residents are able to earn a lot more, it also means that their higher earnings leave the local markets with equally higher prices. Higher prices also mean that the cost of operations grows, and for the e-commerce firm, they meant that a 32% annual increase in general and administrative expenses during its quarter ending in September 2023 turned a gross profit into a net loss.\n\nFinally, before we look at the top 20 fastest growing e-Commerce companies, a look at the U.S. e-Commerce sector is indispensable. This is because while China might reign supreme, the U.S., which can rightly be called the birthplace of global e-Commerce, is nevertheless the second biggest e-Commerce industry in the world.\n\nWhen analyzing an industry for innovation, looking at its fringes is often worthwhile. So, to see what's happening in the U.S. e-Commerce industry, one might consider checking out some e-Commerce startups and small e-Commerce brands. One way to do this is to see which small cap e-Commerce stocks are seeing strong hedge fund interest. After all, hedge funds build their reputation on investing, and Insider Monkey took a look at some small top e-Commerce companies in the U.S. as part of our previous coverage. This revealed that the three top small e-Commerce American firms were Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W), and Revolve Group, Inc. (NYSE:RVLV). You can click on the link above for more details.\n\nSo, with inflation starting to drop all over and firms navigating much tighter capital and monetary environments, we decided to look at the fastest growing e-commerce companies in the world. Some of these are D-Market Elektronik Hizmetler ve Ticaret A.S. (NASDAQ:HEPS), PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), and LightInTheBox Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE:LITB). 20 Fastest Growing E-Commerce Companies in 2024\n\nA delivery man driving a van in metropolitan city, carrying last-mile delivery services of the company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the fastest growing e-Commerce companies, we ranked all publicly traded e-Commerce stocks with at least $100 million in annual revenue by their annual revenue growth and picked the fastest growing firms. For the calculations, preference was given to the annual calendar year 2023 revenue growth. For firms that haven't reported Q4 2023 earnings, the trailing twelve month over 2022 annual revenue growth was calculated. Finally, since the list also includes global e-Commerce companies, for firms whose fiscal year ended in or after June 2023, the fiscal year was chosen to calculate growth. For others, the trailing twelve month figure was used.\n\n20 Fastest Growing E-Commerce Companies in 2024\n\n20. Baozun Inc. (NASDAQ:BZUN)\n\nLatest Annual Revenue Growth: 1.19%\n\nBaozun Inc.

        "content": "Some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest investors made new bets on technology giants in the fourth quarter, loading up on stakes in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA) and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), however, did not. The conglomerate trimmed its holdings in Apple (AAPL) and HP (HPE) while adding to its stakes in oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). There was at least one additional investment Berkshire kept confidential for now. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett. REUTERS/Scott Morgan/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe details about these new bets made in the fourth quarter emerged this week in a series of filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Large institutional investors are required to make these disclosures on a quarterly basis, showing what they bought and sold.\n\nWhat the latest batch showed is that many piled into tech names at the end of 2023.\n\nA hedge fund run by Michael Burry \u2014 who famously shorted subprime mortgages during the 2008 financial crisis and became a central figure in Michael Lewis\u2019s 2010 book \"The Big Short\" \u2014 added 35,000 shares of Alphabet and 30,000 shares of Amazon. That fund, Scion Capital, also boosted bets on Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com. Michael Burry of Scion Capital. (Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage) (Jim Spellman via Getty Images)\n\nMany hedge funds also gravitated to the stock of Nvidia, the dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\n\nBridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund firm, increased its stake in Nvidia by 458% as it added more than 220,000 shares.\n\nIt also increased its position in Alphabet by more than 465,000 shares, making it the fund\u2019s 12th-largest position as of the end of December, and added a small stake in Apple.\n\nAnother hedge fund, AQR, increased its stake in Nvidia by 22%. But it trimmed its holdings in Apple and Microsoft, its two largest positions, by 5% and 4%. Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, talks with customers as Apple's Vision Pro headset is displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBerkshire sold just 1% of its holdings in Apple, or 10 million shares, leaving it with a huge stake of more than 950 million shares.\n\nApple has had a rough start to 2024 as it juggled downgrades to its stock price, major changes to its App Store policies, and a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business. These challenges mounted as it launched the ambitious Vision Pro headset.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne other notable investor pared back its exposure to Apple in the fourth quarter: the Soros Fund.\n\nThe outfit started by billionaire investor George Soros and now run by his son closed out a short position and zeroed out of its underlying holdings in the tech giant.\n\nSome of these same investors made some notable bets on the banking industry, especially a regional lender that is currently under a lot of scrutiny: New York Community Bank (NYCB). A branch of the New York Community Bank in Yonkers, N.Y. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe Soros fund, AQR and Millennium Capital Management all increased their exposure to NYCB, which surprised Wall Street on Jan. 31 by slashing its dividend and reporting a net quarterly loss of $252 million.\n\nIt is not known what these funds did with their stakes between the end of the fourth quarter and now.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Beware of These 3 Chinese Stocks: A Must-Avoid List",
        "content": "Last week, I talked about how emerging market investors are increasingly leaving Chinese stocks out in the cold. If you\u2019re a China bull, you may argue that including Chinese stocks as part of a wider \u201cemerging market\u201d category isn\u2019t fair to those skewing further left on an emerging/developed market spectrum. And that\u2019s a fair point. As I said in that article, China\u2019s 30% share of the overall emerging market sphere reduces the impact of smaller-cap companies in, for example, Brazil, in favor of a heavier Chinese stock concentration that\u2019s better off categorized separately.\n\nBut that\u2019s the bull thesis.\n\nAn alternate and no less justified tact says that overexposure to Chinese stocks puts investor capital at risk in a market with an over-engineered economy that can (and does) step into private companies\u2019 business as the government sees fit to serve collective Chinese interests at the expense of shareholders and stakeholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s how one analyst describes the recent decision to cut 66 Chinese stocks from major global indices, saying, \u201cIt highlights the issue of negative flows for Chinese stocks as investors reduce exposure to the country, in large part due to recent weak fundamentals, but also fears of ongoing financial instability, regulatory uncertainty, and \u2014 most of all \u2014 country risk.\u201d\n\nThese three Chinese stocks to avoid tend to be popular among retail investors \u2014 but HODL at your own risk.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven from a bullish Chinese stock perspective, Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) is worth trimming or cutting out of your portfolio completely. Not purely because of the geopolitical and economic risks, but because direct competitor Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) is increasingly edging out and putting pressure on the e-commerce retailer.\n\nThough it remains slightly smaller than BABA based on market cap, PDD shares far outperformed Alibaba, returning 60% over the past six months compared to BABA\u2019s 25% loss over the same period. But the biggest risk facing BABA, as it relates to losing its once-top spot to Pinduoduo, is discount pricing and market share. Right now, PDD is beating BABA on both counts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut BABA isn\u2019t helping itself either, considering it missed recent earnings estimates. Though buybacks and dividends might boost the stock\u2019s price in the short run, its long-term prospects are less clear. The company is, \u00e1 la Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), increasingly pivoting outside of its e-commerce purview, notably within cloud computing. But that market is increasingly flooded, and, with less than 10% of the global market, BABA\u2019s peripheral ambitions risk eating into slim margins and bringing the Chinese stock down further.\n\nNio Inc (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom a macro perspective, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio Inc (NYSE:NIO) faces risk as the global EV market cools amid regulatory churn and reduced overall demand. And, like BABA, NIO faces substantial pressure among comparable Chinese stocks and stiff international competition. For example, of the overall Chinese EV market, Nio claims just 2% of the overall market share, leagues behind BYD\u2019s (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) 35% market share and Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) 8%.\n\nAs InvestorPlace\u2019s Louis Navallier covered recently, even aggressive government stimulus isn\u2019t enough to save the Chinese stock. His research note pointed to the company\u2019s plummeting monthly vehicle delivery rate alongside consistent unprofitability. That fundamental weakness isn\u2019t enough for government stimulus and short-selling restrictions to overcome. Though the stock bounced on the overall news, don\u2019t expect the rebound to last. The company is still overvalued by any practical metric, considering it trades at 1.2x sales and more than 4x book value today.\n\nChinese EV stocks are a risky proposition overall, considering global expansion concerns, tariffs, and supply chain problems relating to high-tech components that next-gen cars demand. If you must pick one, stick with Charlie Munger\u2019s recommendation \u2014 but avoid Nio at all costs.\n\niShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) delisted stocks concept image of delist Chinese stocks from US stock market\n\nSource: Akarat Phasura / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.59%, or $59 annually on a $10,000 investment\n\nOf course, if you want to avoid (or short) Chinese stocks based on their fundamentally skewed risk/reward profile, iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) is the clear \u201cwinner.\u201d The basket of Chinese stocks holds many publicly tradable on U.S. exchanges but, critically, also a handful inaccessible through domestic investment platforms.\n\nFor example, though BABA and PDD are both top MCHI holdings, the ETF also has Chinese stocks like China Construction Bank and Ping Insurance. With more than 15% of its overall weight attributable to financial stocks like these, MCHI\u2019s per-share price faces massive downside risk if the Chinese government can\u2019t contain rapid economic decline.\n\nMCHI\u2019s short interest has remained fairly steady, though elevated, over the past few months. If you\u2019re interested in keeping a close eye on Chinese stocks, this ETF is the easy pick to monitor overall investor sentiment in the region \u2014 and whether smart money sees Chinese stocks heading for a cliff.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Emerging Tech Titans Primed for a 400% Rally",
        "content": "Among the blue-chip stocks, certain tech giants stand on the brink of a monumental surge. They are offering an edgy opportunity for value growth. As the world goes through digital transformations, three consumer discretionary companies emerge as titans, harnessing consumer demand to fuel their value ascent. This has led to this list of emerging tech stocks.\n\nEach company paints a compelling picture of potential, from the first pioneering e-commerce strategies to the second innovative logistics solutions and the third disruptive market approach. The article delves into their recent performances and initiatives, propelling them towards a potential price rally.\n\nFrom revenue growth fueled by data-driven monetization to customer-centric strategies driving market dominance, read more to explore dissecting the strategies, strengths, and trajectories of these emerging tech titans. Know more about how they offer the untapped potential of a solid price return.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are the best emerging tech stocks to consider.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) e-commerce segment is a fundamental strength. The top line for Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG) reached RMB 129.1 billion, marking a 2% year-over-year increase. This revenue growth suggests the segment\u2019s capability to generate consistent income. However, the Customer Management Revenue (CMR) remained relatively flat year-over-year at RMB 92.1 billion. While this performance indicates stable revenue from customer management services, Alibaba may continue to capture revenue growth through optimized CMR offerings and drive revenue growth.\n\nDirect sales and other revenue were also boosted by\u00a02% (to RMB 31.6 billion). This growth reflects Alibaba\u2019s edge in diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional e-commerce transactions. Revenue from the Chinese commerce wholesale business increased significantly by 23%. Hence, this growth suggests Alibaba\u2019s lead in catering to the demand from wholesale buyers and providing value-added services through platforms like 1688.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nFundamentally, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce segment remains a powerhouse based on evolving monetization strategies. One of Alibaba\u2019s strengths lies its ability to leverage data and technology to boost the user experience, optimize merchant operations, and drive monetization.\n\nAdditionally, Alibaba\u2019s ecosystem approach integrates various services and platforms under the TTG umbrella. This allows it to capture synergies, cross-selling opportunities, and economies of scale. By offering an edgy suite of products and services, including payment solutions, logistics, marketing tools, and cloud services, Alibaba frames an integrated experience for users and merchants alike. This further solidifies its competitive edge in e-commerce. This makes it one of those emerging tech stocks.\n\nLooking ahead, Alibaba is expected to continue to invest in tech, infrastructure, and customer engagement initiatives to drive long-term growth. Therefore, through enhancing mobile capabilities, expanding into new product categories, or deepening its presence in international markets, Alibaba remains edgy in delivering value expansion potential.\n\nJD (JD) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD (NASDAQ:JD) has multiple fundamentals supporting its value expansion potential. To begin with, JD expanded free shipping coverage for users in Q3. JD has lowered the minimum order value for free shipping services. This move from RMB99 to RMB59 for all users and unlimited free shipping for JD PLUS members for 1P products enhance customer convenience. This improvement in logistics capabilities may continue attracting more customers and encourage existing users to shop more frequently, driving revenue growth.\n\nAdditionally, JD\u2019s live-streaming sessions hosted by category managers proved progressive (especially during the popular Singles Day promotions). The unique aspect of JD\u2019s live streaming is the expertise of category managers. This, combined with JD\u2019s supply chain capabilities, boosts the offering of a great selection of products at competitive prices without additional commission fees. These sessions attracted over 380 million viewers, indicating strong user engagement and the potential for top-line growth during such events. All in all, it\u2019s one of those emerging tech stocks.\n\nFurther, JD expanded the coverage of its industry-leading\u00a0instant refunds and one-click for best-price guaranteed services. These services have focused on boosting customer service quality, increasing user engagement. This can be observed in the accelerated growth in user order frequency in Q3.\n\nFinally, JD\u2019s platform ecosystem strategy targets the best-in-class user experience. The company allows both 1P and 3P businesses\u00a0to grow in a complementary and sustainable manner. Streamlining merchant onboarding processes, enhancing support for new merchants, and establishing a fair scoring system based on an edgy operating philosophy are the key elements supporting both 1P and 3P merchants. Hence, this strategy may continue to boost the valuation potential based on increased user engagement.\n\nPDD (PDD) Illustration of geometric mask surrounded by tech symbols against blue background representing artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Andrey Suslov\n\nPDD\u2019s (NASDAQ:PDD) top-line growth and related diversity are critical fundamentals supporting the high-value surge. For instance, PDD attained an impressive total revenue of RMB68.8 billion in Q3, marking a substantial 94% year-on-year increase. This significant growth indicates the company\u2019s capability to capitalize on market demand and drive top-line expansion.\n\nOn the other hand, revenues from online marketing services and other sources reached\u00a0RMB 39.7 billion, up 39% year-over-year. Additionally, revenues from transaction services surged by 315% year-on-year to hit RMB 29.1 billion. This highlights PDD\u2019s diversified top-line and its lead in monetizing its platform.\n\nFurthermore, PDD benefits from improving consumer sentiment and robust demand for consumption upgrades in China. The company offers quality products at affordable prices that meet consumers\u2019 needs, driving higher transaction volumes and revenue growth. PDD has the value proposition of providing savings and better services through strategic promotional campaigns such as the Duoduo Harvest Festival and the National Brand Festival. This may continue to attract consumers with attractive prices and incentivize purchases.\n\nMoreover,\u00a0PDD\u2019s continuous investment in platform resources and technology enables it to expand its user base based on product offerings. By offering a wide selection of quality products and enhancing the shopping experience, PDD may continue to capture market share. It\u2019s one of those emerging tech stocks to buy.\n\nOverall, PDD\u2019s top-line solid growth pushes it towards expansion and a market edge. The company\u2019s focus on consumer-centric strategies, promotional campaigns, and tech-driven initiatives may sustain its revenue growth momentum. Lastly, international expansion efforts and further diversification of product categories could push the valuation toward higher multiples.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in JD and BABA.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Michael Burry, the money manager made famous in the Big Short, added to wagers on Chinese tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. in recent months even as a rout in Chinese shares deepened.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Brutal Reality of Plunging Office Values Is Here Israel Pulls Out of Peace Talks Over \u2018Delusional\u2019 Hamas Demands Dip Buyers Wade Back In to Fuel Wall Street Gains: Markets Wrap Lyft\u2019s CEO Says \u2018My Bad\u2019 on Margin Error, \u2018It Was One Zero\u2019 Musk Says Putin Can\u2019t Lose in Ukraine, Opposes Senate Bill\n\nAlibaba is now Scion Asset Management\u2019s top holding after Burry\u2019s investment company boosted its stake in the e-commerce giant by 50% in the period ended Dec. 31, according to the firm\u2019s most recent 13F filing. While the stake was only $5.81 million, it\u2019s a starkly contrarian bet on China\u2019s largest online retailer. Smaller rival JD.com Inc. was Scion\u2019s second biggest holding at $5.79 million after the firm increased its position by 75,000 shares.\n\nSo far the wagers are struggling to pan out. Alibaba is down 5% year-to-date and JD.com has tumbled almost 20% as global money managers unwind positions in Chinese stocks amid an ongoing property crisis and slowing growth.\n\nRead more: Wall Street Is Going to Great Lengths to Avoid Chinese Equities\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Burry, who rose to fame predicting the 2008 US housing crash, has bet on the companies.\n\nAt the end of 2022 he snapped up shares of New York-listed Alibaba and JD.com as China was emerging from the pandemic.

Global funds offloaded 14.5 billion yuan ($2 billion) worth of shares on a net basis in January via trading links with Hong Kong, extending their selling to a record sixth month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS-based money manager GW&K Investment Management LLC, which made a big bet on China, closed its emerging-markets equity fund last month.

The company was the biggest new buy for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), General Electric Co. (GE) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON).

The Zacks analyst believes that a weak China market, sluggishness in online physical goods GMV at Taobao and Tmall marketplaces, and stiff competition from the domestic as well as foreign e-commerce companies have weighed down on the company\u2019s fortunes. Unfavorable global macroeconomic goings on have also been a hindrance.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s offline entertainment business segments, namely Damai and Alibaba Pictures have been a success. Also, solid momentum in the international commerce business is driving top-line growth.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\nGeneral Electric\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the last six months (+24.5% vs. -0.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that strength in the company\u2019s aerospace segment, gas power services and growth in grid and onshore wind businesses have been beneficial. The company has also made judicious acquisitions over time.\n\nYet, high costs and operating expenses, a soft offshore wind business and supply chain disruptions in the defense market continue to remain major headwinds.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on General Electric here >>>)\n\nShares of Honeywell have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past six months (+3.3% vs. -0.7%). Per the Zacks analyst, strength in the commercial aviation, aerospace and process solutions businesses augurs well for the company. New acquisitions like Compressor Controls are also likely to boost future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, supply chain issues, lower volumes in the warehouse and workflow solutions, high cost of procuring raw materials and foreign currency headwinds continue to remain major concerns.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Honeywell here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 7.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.84 indicates a change of -0.3% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alibaba is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $31.18 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $131.86 billion and $141.19 billion estimates indicate +4.6% and +7.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $36.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $2.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.46%. The EPS surprise was -2.2%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alibaba surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "13 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best metaverse stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the metaverse, head directly to 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe global metaverse market was valued at $98.7 billion in 2023, and it is anticipated to grow significantly, reaching $1,402.5 billion by 2032. IMARC Group predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.29% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. Factors supporting this growth include advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and cloud computing. Additionally, increased user interest in immersive digital experiences, online gaming, social media platforms, enhanced internet connectivity, and a growing desire for personalized experiences contribute to the metaverse\u2019s expansion. Tarik Chebib, Capital.com\u2019s chief revenue officer, told Reuters:\n\n\u201cThe internet will end as we know it and the metaverse will totally reshape the global economy.\u201d\n\nThe gaming industry, with its widespread use of alternative realities in games like Fortnite and Roblox, is poised to play a pivotal role in the metaverse, according to Tarik Chebib. Given the global user base of 3.2 billion gamers, there is substantial potential demand for the metaverse revolution. Furthermore, the gaming sector contributes valuable software expertise to serve as the foundation for metaverse development. The primary deficiency lies in hardware, as per Chebib, who emphasized the necessity for a streamlined solution that doesn't require users to wear bulky headsets for participation. The gaming sector is expected to be a significant beneficiary of the metaverse's growth, projected to represent around half of the market by 2024, totaling $400 billion. Major players in this domain include Epic Games, Roblox, and Microsoft, which strengthened its position with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, creators of Call of Duty, for a historic $69 billion. Microsoft's leadership in the industry, particularly with titles like Minecraft, suggests a trend where other companies may follow suit. Chebib further commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cVideo games help us visualize what the metaverse could look like. Gaming companies are really interesting cases as they have already created worlds where people buy skins, avatars and collect different things.\u201d\n\n2022 was expected to be the year of the metaverse, marked by Facebook's transformation to Meta in October 2021, reflecting Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s enthusiasm for the potential of virtual and augmented reality. However, this did not materialize, and in 2023, the metaverse took a backseat to artificial intelligence. However, in 2024, there is potential for a metaverse resurgence in public attention as Apple launched its $3,500 Vision Pro headset, announced midway through 2023. Speculation suggests it could have a transformative impact on the metaverse similar to what the iPhone did for smartphones and the iPad did for portable tablet computing.\n\nSome of the best metaverse stocks to invest in include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe assessed the total holdings of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE:METV) and chose the top metaverse stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).  13 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nPhoto by David Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dek on Unsplash\n\nBest Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\n\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a technology company facilitating digital payments globally for both merchants and consumers. On February 7, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.48 and a revenue of $8 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.12 and $130 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the number of payment transactions rose by 13%, reaching 6.8 billion, while the total payment transactions for the fiscal year 2023 increased by 12% to 25 billion. Despite that, active accounts decreased 2% year-over-year, amounting to 426 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 78 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter. Gavin Baker\u2019s Atreides Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.17 million shares worth $244 million.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also contributed less to portfolio performance than most holdings during the fourth quarter. The total payment volume handled by PayPal during its most recent quarter grew +15%, which helped drive healthy revenue growth and +20% earnings per share growth. Critically, the Company\u2019s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal\u2019s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal\u2019s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants. We added to our position with the stock trading at just 10X forward earnings estimates during the quarter because there are many more long-term growth opportunities relative to most financial companies that trade for similar multiples and compared to technology companies that trade for much higher multiples.\u201d\n\n12. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and supply of semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments \u2013 Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. On December 7, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $11.06 and a revenue of $9.3 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $20 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 87 hedge funds were long Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.70 billion.\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.\u201d\n\n11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a global entertainment company with three segments \u2013 Entertainment, Sports, and Experiences. On February 8, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) declared a $0.45 per share semi-annual dividend, a 50% increase from the prior dividend of $0.30. The dividend is payable on July 25, to shareholders of record as of July 8.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 89 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 92 funds in the preceding quarter. Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 32.8 million shares worth $2.66 billion.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).\u00a0 The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.\u201d\n\n10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, and sale of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices globally. It is one of the top metaverse stocks to watch. On February 7, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a revenue of approximately NT$215.79 billion for January, showing a 7.9% increase from January 2023 and a 22.4% rise from December. TSMC also recently announced plans to construct a second chip fabrication facility in Japan in collaboration with Sony, Denso, Toyota, and the Japanese government.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 107 hedge funds were bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 121 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard\u2019s First Eagle Investment Management is a significant position holder in the company, with a stake worth $780.3 million.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was also a top contributor to performance. The Company began shipping chips that were fabricated using its industry-leading \u201cN3\u2033 node. Nearly all of the Company\u2019s N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity. The Company is arguably one of a handful of the world\u2019s most important and largest companies, but because the Company\u2019s shares trade as an ADR (American Depositary Receipt) the shares are not part of the major stock market indices in the U.S. As a result, the shares are woefully under owned by U.S. investors (institutional and individual), particularly for a company that regularly generates cash flow return on invested capital in excess of +40%. Therefore, our growing position in these shares represent a significantly relatively overweight portfolio position versus our peers and benchmarks. We could not be more pleased by this anachronistic institutional imperative.\u201d\n\n9. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) offers technology infrastructure and marketing services to enable engagement between merchants, brands, and businesses with users and customers worldwide. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to buy. On February 7, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPADS of $2.67 and a revenue of $36.67 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.03 and $270 million, respectively. Alibaba announced that its board has authorized a $25 billion expansion of its stock buyback program until the end of March 2027. The company now has $35.3 billion remaining for share repurchases over the next three fiscal years.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 112 funds in the preceding quarter.\n\nL1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long -18%) shares weakened in recent months as Chinese reopening strength faded and macro-economic data points began sequentially declining. Nevertheless, we believe the Chinese government will use consumption as a key lever to reinvigorate the economy post-COVID lockdowns. Alibaba remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud, and management is taking proactive steps to unlock shareholder value. It has announced plans to split into six major business groups \u2013 Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media, and Entertainment Group. Each group will be managed independently, with a separate CEO and board, have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this restructure will be a strong positive catalyst to unlock the sum-of-the-parts valuation upside in the company.\u201d\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units, and other related products and services. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\n\nOn February 1, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, projecting $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi analyst Christopher Danely suggested that AMD might be intentionally underestimating the revenue and there are indications that the actual figures could exceed the projections. Danely estimates that AMD might generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from the MI300, a product associated with artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont\u2019s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover \u2013 performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get \u2018lucky\u2019 investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).\u201d\n\n7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) ranks 7th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments \u2013 Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. On December 18, Adobe and Figma jointly announced the cancellation of their $20 billion merger due to increasing regulatory challenges globally. The companies stated that they see no clear path to obtaining necessary approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. In light of the terminated deal, Adobe will pay Figma the agreed-upon $1 billion termination fee. Following this development, Barclays upgraded Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock to Overweight, citing reduced concerns over dilution.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBoth Alphabet and Adobe\u2019s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.\u201d\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 134\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown an increased commitment to the metaverse with the recent announcement of its first mixed-reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro. The headset provides users with virtual and augmented reality experiences, offering a gateway to a version of the metaverse. It features Apple's metaverse-style operating system, VisionOS, emphasizing spatial computing. The launch signals Apple's strategic move into the extended reality (XR) landscape. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best metaverse stocks to watch.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 134 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares valued at $156.75 billion.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in.\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds 11 Best Small Cap Electric Vehicle Stocks to Invest In 26 Largest Mining Companies by Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a013 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for the Upcoming AI Wars",
        "content": "Last month, the writers at InvestorPlace.com and I recommended four stocks to buy for the coming \u201cAI Wars.\u201d Governments worldwide know that artificial intelligence has incredible potential, and everyone is racing to come out ahead.\n\nThe United Kingdom has promised to pour $1.3 billion over the next five years into AI and supercomputing, while China will put in double that amount. If you include government subsidies of chip factories (the most capital-intensive part of AI investment), roughly $120 billion has now been pledged.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing the effects of this new AI nationalism. Since January, shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) \u2014 one of the four stocks we highlighted last week \u2014 have surged 45% on strong fourth-quarter earnings. The secretive company specializes in helping corporations and governments eke out AI-driven insights from mounds of data. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of Louis Navellier\u2019s top picks, has risen 45% since the start of the year after tripling the prices of its AI-focused H100 flagship processors. U.K.-based AI chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is up almost 60% after earnings\u2026 the list goes on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, these companies are raising prices and creating monopolies\u2026 and governments are happy to allow it.\n\nOf course, some AI stocks will take time to play out. Last Friday, shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (another of our four picks from last week) fell 12% after the chipmaker announced a weaker-than-expected forecast. It will likely take one or two more years for Intel to see the benefits of the billion-dollar subsidies the U.S. government is providing.\n\nNevertheless, this much is clear: When governments and investors all want a sector to succeed, the combination of supporting tariffs, subsidies and lax regulation can often make it so. We\u2019ve seen this before in other industries\u2026 from shale oil and gas drilling in the Dakotas to electric vehicle production in China\u2019s Anhui province. Once a state begins putting its thumb on the scale, those favored industries have little choice but to succeed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis week, Luke Lango reveals another group of stocks in The AI Endgame. During that event, Luke will tell us all about the final phase of the AI Revolution, which could send several unknown stocks soaring to new heights\u2026 while simultaneously erasing thousands of stocks from the markets. You can sign up to reserve your spot for that event \u2014 Tuesday, Feb. 13, at 8 p.m. Eastern \u2014 here.\n\nAnd in the meantime, our writers here at InvestorPlace.com have chosen three blue-chip stocks to help keep you ahead as these AI Wars continue to escalate.\n\n3 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps the clearest potential winner of AI nationalism will be Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google. The company launched its answer to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT on Wednesday, and our initial tests suggest it\u2019s even better than GPT-4.\n\nThis comes as much-needed good news for the search giant. Digital ad revenues have been slowing for years, and Google has become increasingly reliant on its cloud computing business for growth. A strong showing by its new AI product \u2014 Google Gemini \u2014 will help it push past rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It\u2019s one of the reasons why David Moadel, one of InvestorPlace\u2019s top contributors, believes that Alphabet is a Mag 7 bargain:\n\n\u201cThere no denying that Alphabet is committed to developing the latest and greatest in AI tech\u2026 [and] agree with Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali, who asserts that Alphabet \u201cremains at the forefront of the AI race.\u201d All three of the analysts mentioned here assigned a \u201cbuy\u201d rating to GOOG/GOOGL stock.\n\n\u201cMy forecast GOOG stock is 100% bullish and I encourage investors to grab some shares before the next long-term rally commences.\u201d\n\nAI nationalism is also particularly important for Alphabet because it has the most to gain from lax regulation. Google has the broadest access to online data of any major tech firm, having indexed the web for the past 25 years. Many publishers also give Google the ability to \u201ccrawl\u201d content behind paywalled sites \u2014 a privilege that virtually no other firm has.\n\nThat makes Google the most likely company to beat ChatGPT \u2014 provided it can use the data it\u2019s collected. Studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) continue improving as more training data is added. So, a hands-off approach by regulators will be essential to helping Google win.\n\nOf course, other American blue-chips will also benefit from favorable regulation. Export restrictions to China will eventually turn into import restrictions, protecting companies like Nvidia from cheaper Chinese rivals. Microsoft and Amazon will both find themselves protected from trustbusters because regulators recognize that AI is only as good as the massive amounts of data it hoovers up.\n\nBut AI will benefit Google the most, given the company\u2019s awkward reliance on a slowing search business and the amount of data it has. Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks, trading at only 21 times forward earnings. If the company manages to beat OpenAI, a renewed surge of growth gives the search giant a 50% to 60% upside from here.\n\n2. ASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLast year was a tough time to own ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the world\u2019s only producer of advanced chipmaking machinery. The Netherlands-based company had found itself caught in the China-U.S. fight over chip export restrictions, and shares lost as much as 25% going into the fall. Regulators knew that ASML served as the lynchpin of advanced semiconductor manufacturing, so they banned sales of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) chipmaking machinery to kneecap China\u2019s growing chipmaking business.\n\nHowever, Western governments have since realized that choking off ASML\u2019s business entirely is a bad idea. Roughly a quarter of ASML\u2019s total operating costs come from its R&D department, and ASML needs to keep innovating to stay ahead of the competition. Subsequent export restrictions have since been watered down to include only the latest models.\n\nThat\u2019s had a predictable effect on earnings estimates and share prices. Analysts have been nudging their 2024-2025 estimates up across the board, and shares have risen over 50% since October. It\u2019s why InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Chris MacDonald continues to recommend shares of this impressive firm.\n\n\u201cASML\u2019s top position in EUV technology is critical for semiconductor advancement, especially in advanced memory solutions. CEO Peter Wennink maintained a humble outlook despite positive signs of a 2024 revenue similar to the previous year. The company sets eyes for significant growth in 2025.\u201d\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany Chinese firms will win thanks to AI nationalism. The Chinese government has a $40 billion state fund to boost the semiconductor industry, and dozens of chipmaking firms have sprung up to take advantage of the handouts. Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, Nexchip Semiconductor and United Nova are among these names.\n\nHowever, the \u201csafest\u201d of Chinese AI plays is most likely Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), a monopolistic software giant with few strong competitors. Unlike Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Tencent has remained on the right side of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Its CEO has never \u201cdisappeared\u201d for months on end. And Tencent has been far better managed than Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), China\u2019s top search-engine company, which failed to recognize opportunities in cloud computing. Tencent has masterfully navigated M&A deals across the greater China region, earning north of 20% returns.\n\nMost importantly, Tencent has no stake in the cut-throat world of semiconductor manufacturing. The company focuses on mobile games, online chat, enterprise businesses, music streaming and other high-margin tech services that AI will make even more profitable. Analysts expect the firm to earn 30% operating margins going into 2024. (SMIC, by comparison, barely covers its cost of capital.)\n\nThe Chinese tech giant also has significant exposure to cloud computing, business services, and fintech, which fits neatly into its AI ambitions. In 2022, this segment eclipsed its gaming sales, and analysts see this as a significant growth area for the next several years. Josh Enomoto at InvestorPlace.com sees at least 34% upside from current prices, while a successful pivot to AI would mean even more.\n\nOf course, Tencent comes with the broader risks of buying Chinese stocks. The country has recently seen an exodus of investors, driven out by fears of real estate contagion and a rapidly decelerating economy. The tech firm also remains beholden to the whims of the CCP; in December, Tencent\u2019s shares fell double-digits after Chinese regulators announced a wide range of rules aimed at curbing spending on video games. (The CCP would later fire a top government official over the resulting market meltdown, sending Tencent\u2019s shares back up.)\n\nStill, Paul La Monica sees this most recent drawdown as an opportunity to buy Chinese shares cheaply. He notes that insiders have recently snapped up shares.\n\n\u201cThe reported stock purchases by Ma and Tsai are certainly a sign of confidence and could suggest that Alibaba and the overall Chinese stock market have bottomed. Investors are also growing increasingly optimistic about the possibility of more stimulus from Beijing. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that a nearly $280 billion market stabilization package is in the works, where state-owned financial companies would buy up local shares of Chinese stocks.\u201d\n\nAnd now that even Chinese President Xi Jinping is attempting to calm investors, this likely marks as the best time in years to buy shares of Tencent.\n\nThe New AI Wars\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve talked about the large companies helped by direct government intervention. These are essentially the equivalent of the South Korean family-run conglomerates (chaebol), or the eight conglomerates of Japan. Dependable and protected\u2026 but with somewhat limited upside because of their size.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke has ventured further to find the secondary winners of this new AI reality. Though his research, he\u2019s found incredible growth companies that are leading innovation, even without much government help. Many of these firms could even rival the big players someday. And to get you started, Luke releases a new report this week that outlines five 1,000% winners for The AI Endgame. To reserve your spot for that event on Tuesday at 8 p.m. Eastern \u2014 and to learn how to get that report \u2014 click here.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll see you back here next Sunday\u2026\n\nRegards,\n\nThomas Yeung, CFA\n\nMarkets Analyst, InvestorPlace.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas held LONG positions in GOOG and GOOGL.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable E-Commerce Stocks Set to Soar in 2024",
        "content": "The e-commerce sector has been a rollercoaster over the past few years, thanks to the ripples created by the pandemic. Many former high-flying stocks now sit at depressed levels after the temporary Covid-19 boom ended and more normal growth resumed. This cooldown may have made it seem like the potential of this sector had been overhyped.\n\nHowever, I think the cooldown was simply an adjustment to more sustainable long-term trends, not a sign that e-commerce is fading. My conviction on stocks like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), which I recommended in mid-2022 when sentiment was still very negative, has already paid off as the recovery narrative takes hold. I believe other unjustly punished e-commerce stocks will also come back stronger. Let\u2019s take a look at these under-loved e-commerce stocks ready to rebound higher!\n\nSea Inc (SE) SEA Limited - Shopee app on mobile phone\n\nSource: Muh.Imron / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to long-term upside potential, Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) remains one of my highest conviction picks, even after its massive selloff. This Singapore-based company operates three fast-growing businesses \u2013 Garena, Shopee e-commerce, and SeaMoney fintech.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile growth has decelerated recently, Sea\u2019s fundamentals remain strong for multi-year outperformance. The region it operates in Southeast Asia offers a massive runway for further penetration \u2013 both in gaming and online shopping. As middle-class incomes rise in Asia, Sea is poised to capitalize on swelling demand.\n\nGarena\u2019s games, like League of Legends and FIFA Online 3, already have tremendous user bases. Meanwhile, Shopee is cementing itself as a top e-commerce destination across Southeast Asia. With growth in the region expected to continue outpacing developed markets, Sea\u2019s leading market positioning leaves the company with ample room for expansion.\n\nSea does not have the best margins currently, and near-term headwinds may persist. However, with analysts\u2019 earnings per share growth estimates coming in at more than 100% from 2023 to 2025, and its forward price-earnings ratio sitting at just 15-times based on 2025 EPS, SE stock offers compelling long-term value.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has been lumped in with the broader selloff across Chinese equities amid concerns over geopolitics and growth in this region. However, with shares now trading at just 8-times forward earnings and 0.25-times sales, JD stock offers one of the best risk/reward setups in global e-commerce.\n\nWhile China\u2019s economy has shown weakness recently, growth still remains far stronger than developed markets at a nearly 5.2% annual run rate. China also holds tremendous foreign reserves and runs large trade surpluses, offering potential stability.\n\nSentiment has sunk tremendously low for JD stock as regulators continue to crack down on Chinese tech names. But with officials now moving to support stocks and e-commerce, conditions may soon improve. A proposed stimulus package worth $278 billion could help lend support.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s massive population and rising middle class will continue fueling immense e-commerce growth this decade. China\u2019s online retail market is forecast to expand at a 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028 \u2013 far faster than other major economies. JD holds a commanding presence here as the #2 player behind Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Thus, this stock\u2019s upside could be substantial if sentiment stabilizes and growth reaccelerates.\n\nChewy (CHWY) The Chewy logo on a banner at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike other picks, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) has struggled mightily since going public, with losses continuing to provide a big drag on its balance sheet. But with spending on pets booming, especially among younger consumers, this leading online pet retailer will likely deliver big returns for patient investors.\n\nChewy has continued to expand its wide assortment of pet products, including food, medications, and toys, while leveraging its customer-centric approach. The company\u2019s auto-ship offerings also drive recurring revenue.\n\nDespite economic uncertainty, the outlook for pet spending appears strong. Surveys show Gen Z consumers actually prefer pets over having children. These younger generations are also significantly more likely to shop online than older consumers.\n\nChewy is not solidly profitable, but is making substantial progress. Analysts now forecast the company\u2019s earnings per share to swing to 57 cents in fiscal 2024 and surge to $1.83 by 2029 as scale drives margins. Valuations look attractive at 0.66-times forward sales for a name expanding at mid-to-high single-digit clips.\n\nOwning pets is increasingly popular, and online retail penetration still has ample runway. For investors taking a long view, Chewy\u2019s leadership position makes it a prime stock to ride these demographic tailwinds higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 most promising Chinese stocks according to analysts. If you want to skip our discussion on the Chinese stock market, head directly to 5 Most Promising Chinese Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nChina's economy has shown remarkable growth in the last 30 years, lifting it from a low-income to an upper-middle-income status. In December 2023, the International Monetary Fundreported that China's economic expansion has been significant globally, accounting for 35% of the world's GDP growth in recent years, surpassing the US at 27%. Despite this success, critics have highlighted weaknesses. China's growth heavily relies on investments in real estate, funded by an inefficient banking system. High domestic debt, a declining workforce, and a turbulent property market have led some experts to anticipate an economic downturn. However, the Chinese government has adeptly navigated economic crises, averting potential banking crises, currency devaluations, housing market crashes, and economic collapses. Yet, the foundation of China's growth appears vulnerable historically and analytically. Challenges like unfavorable demographics, high debt, and an inefficient financial system could constrain growth. Nevertheless, if managed effectively, China could pursue a more sustainable growth path, ensuring economic, social, and environmental stability despite potential limitations.\n\nThe challenges faced by the Chinese economy have led to a decline in its stock market, as highlighted by Reuters. Concerns loom over the potential for a deflationary trend in 2024, pushing predictions of further market declines. However, if President Xi Jinping takes assertive measures to revive the $18 trillion economy, a rebound could follow, making China one of the most high-risk, high-reward trades of 2024. The MSCI China Index, tracking stocks in mainland bourses and Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and New York, saw a 15% drop in 2023. Factors contributing to investor pessimism include China's cautious approach in stimulating the economy post-COVID-19, refraining from large-scale infrastructure spending or direct cash handouts. Instead, Xi continues efforts to tackle excessive leverage in the property sector, a significant driver of China's GDP. There are concerns that China might fall into a debt-deflation loop similar to Japan's economic downturn in the 1990s. If consumers and companies continue holding back spending due to the expectation of falling prices, it could shrink earnings, making debt repayment challenging and further impacting corporate earnings and valuations.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational investors are cautious due to rising US interest rates, geopolitical risks impacting technological advancements, and potential economic consequences if China intervenes in Taiwan. However, the dependence on foreign capital in China's equities market is relatively low, with domestic retail traders dominating exchanges and holding significant capital. The performance of Chinese stocks may not necessarily align with economic growth, as historical data suggests. Despite strong economic growth in China, equity returns have lagged behind. This suggests that a slowing economy does not always result in a sluggish stock market. Looking ahead to 2024, projections for Chinese equities vary greatly. Some foresee significant rises or falls in the MSCI China Index, indicating substantial market uncertainty.\n\nPzena Emerging Markets Value Fund (NASDAQ:PZIEX), situated in New York and known for performing well compared to similar funds, increased its investment in China and Hong Kong stocks to roughly 33% of its portfolio during the third quarter. This adjustment marks an increase of about four to five percentage points, as perBloomberg. In comparison, MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI)\u2019s gauge of Emerging Markets sits at 29%. This move by the fund reflects a trend among certain investment managers who are strategically buying Chinese stocks. They are taking advantage of evolving policies aimed at boosting liquidity and reinstating consumer confidence in a struggling economy. Allison Fisch, a money manager at the fund, stated in an email:\n\n\u201cThe indiscriminate selling of Chinese stocks has increased the value opportunity. We\u2019ve been taking advantage by buying up companies we believe are exceptionally cheap relative to their normalized earnings power.\u201d\n\nDespite uncertain economic and stock market conditions, analysts have expressed optimism about some of the Chinese Stocks. In this article, we discuss the most promising Chinese stocks according to analysts, which include Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we first used a stock screener to identify all Chinese stocks which have Buy or better ratings from Wall Street analysts as well as price targets that show a 50% potential upside from their current levels as of February 5. From a comprehensive list of stocks we got as a result, we narrowed down to 11 of these Chinese stocks which have the highest number of hedge fund investors as of the third quarter of 2023. The list is ranked according to the potential upside, from smallest to highest. 11 Most Promising Chinese Stocks According to Analysts\n\nAn employee of the public company in their office in Shanghai, China.\n\nMost Promising Chinese Stocks According to Analysts\n\n11. Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 12\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $22.28\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 60.63%\n\nQifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN)operates a credit-tech platform known as 360 Jietiao in China. The platform provides credit-based services that connect borrowers with financial institutions. Additionally, the company offers platform services to financial institution partners. Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) also extends e-commerce loans, enterprise loans, and invoice loans to small and medium-sized enterprise owners.\n\nOn November 16, Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) announced a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.99. The company reported a revenue of $586.76 million, outperforming estimates by $15.24 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 12 hedge funds were bullish on Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN), compared to 11 funds in the previous quarter.\n\nLike Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE), Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) is one of the most promising Chinese stocks.\n\n10. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 44\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $165.28\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 60.79%\n\nThird on our list of the most promising Chinese stocks is Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), which provides multiple apps including Baidu App and Haokan, as well as online communities like Baidu Knows and Baidu Post. Baidu also offers online marketing services, cloud services, self-driving services, and smart devices through its DuerOS platform.\n\nOn January 26, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Samsung Electronics announced a strategic collaboration, disclosing that Baidu's Ernie AI will be incorporated into Samsung's latest Galaxy S24 series of smartphones in China. This partnership aims to integrate Ernie's functionalities into Samsung's newly introduced Galaxy AI, allowing it to perform tasks such as rapid content translation and summarization.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was part of 44 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 36 in the prior quarter. Alkeon Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.4 million shares worth $332 million.\n\nAriel Global Fund made the following comment about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBy comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China\u2019s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company\u2019s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China\u2019s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu\u2019s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.\u201d\n\n9. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $118.20\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 64.51%\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), along with its subsidiary companies, offers technological support and marketing platforms to assist merchants, brands, retailers, and businesses in connecting with their users and customers in China and worldwide. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the most promising Chinese stocks according to analysts. The company operates through seven sections: China Commerce, International Commerce, Local Consumer Services, Cainiao, Cloud Services, Digital Media and Entertainment, and Innovation Initiatives and Others. On November 16, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) declared a $1.00 per ADS annual dividend. It is to be paid on January 18 to shareholders of record as of December 21.\n\nOn December 21, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\u2019s Taobao China finalized the sale of 25 million American depositary shares belonging to XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), a Chinese electric vehicle company. This sale represented 50 million class A ordinary shares and was priced at $14.18 per ADS. The total value of these securities amounted to approximately $391 million in the market.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to the previous quarter when 112 funds had invested in the stock. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 3.85 million shares valued at $334.26 million.\n\nL1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long -18%) shares weakened in recent months as Chinese reopening strength faded and macro-economic data points began sequentially declining. Nevertheless, we believe the Chinese government will use consumption as a key lever to reinvigorate the economy post-COVID lockdowns. Alibaba remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud, and management is taking proactive steps to unlock shareholder value. It has announced plans to split into six major business groups \u2013 Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media, and Entertainment Group. Each group will be managed independently, with a separate CEO and board, have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs.

(NYSE:BEKE), up from 36 funds in the previous quarter. Lei Zhang\u2019s Hillhouse Capital Management is the largest shareholder of the company, with a position comprising 30.67 million shares valued at $475.93 million.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund made the following comment about KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBottom contributors to performance for the quarter included real estate platform KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE). Beke fell due to weaker industry property sales in China in April following the release of strong pent-up demand in Q1, despite accelerating revenue and very modest cost growth.\u201d\n\n7.

This revival was attributed to the sustained rebound in both leisure and business travel demand. Breaking down the quarterly performance, RevPAR in October, November, and December 2023 stood at 120%, 117%, and 123% of the 2019 levels, respectively. For the entire year of 2023, the RevPAR reached an overall level of 122% compared to the figures from 2019.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s third quarter database, 28 hedge funds were bullish on H World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT), compared to 31 funds in the preceding quarter.\n\n6. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $39.81\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 82.78%\n\nJD.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:JD), and KE Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BEKE), Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) is one of the most promising Chinese stocks. It ranks 6th on our list of the most promising Chinese stocks.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund made the following comment about JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cJD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the three largest e-commerce platforms in China. Shares declined after the company reported a slowdown in fourth quarter sales and commented that deliberate culling of unprofitable SKUs would also be a drag on headline revenue growth in the first half of 2023. We believe the slowdown was driven by the peak in Chinese COVID lockdowns, which have since ended, and the elimination or reduction of unprofitable business is better for long-term margins and returns on capital. We remain investors.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Promising Chinese Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024 15 Largest Sovereign Wealth Funds: One Earned $213 Billion in 2023 10 Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a011 Most Promising Chinese Stocks According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently trimmed by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to\u00a0Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.\n\nThe frenzy in the stock market continues unabated on February 9 as the S&P 500 index achieved a significant milestone by surpassing the 5,000 mark, signaling heightened investor optimism and buoyancy in the market sentiment. This surge was fueled by a resurgence in the technology sector and optimism surrounding potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which bodes well for corporate earnings outlooks. Notably, the latest revision in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) underscored progress in taming inflation towards the end of 2023, providing additional impetus to the bullish sentiment. However, amidst the euphoria, concerns have been raised by strategists like BofA's Hartnett, who warned that stocks are nearing a threshold that could trigger a sell-off, urging caution among investors. Interestingly, amidst the fervor in equity markets, there has been a notable appetite for fixed-income assets, as highlighted by Allspring's Pacquement. This underscores a nuanced approach among investors, who are seemingly diversifying their portfolios amid the ongoing market rally. The sustained upward trajectory in stock prices, particularly in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, underscores the resilience and dominance of the technology sector in driving market gains. This relentless climb in stock prices reflects investor confidence in the prospects of major tech companies and their ability to deliver robust financial performance in the coming quarters.\n\nAs the S&P 500 index crosses the historic threshold of 5,000 for the first time, investors are grappling with the decision of whether to jump into the market or remain on the sidelines. While financial advisers caution against placing undue importance on milestone moments like these, they also emphasize the importance of considering individual circumstances before making investment decisions. In light of this record-breaking milestone, it's crucial for investors to contextualize the significance of this event and carefully assess its implications. Market strategists and wealth advisers recommend a thoughtful approach to framing the decision-making process. Rather than reacting impulsively to the headline-grabbing news, investors are encouraged to evaluate their own financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline to determine the most prudent course of action. Ultimately, the decision to invest or wait should be guided by a thorough understanding of one's own financial situation and objectives. While milestone moments in the market can capture attention, it's essential to maintain a disciplined approach to investing and avoid making decisions based solely on short-term market movements. By taking a comprehensive and strategic approach, investors can navigate market fluctuations with confidence and make informed choices that align with their long-term financial goals.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)\u00a0and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) by trimming their price targets. Check out the complete article to see details of these stocks. Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks\n\nWall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks\n\n10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +11.40 (+11.50%)\n\nOn February 8, Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman made headlines by revising The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) price target downward by $5 to $120 per share while maintaining a buy rating for the company. This adjustment, although seemingly bearish on the surface, triggered an unexpected surge in market activity, with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock price jumping by 11.50% compared to its previous closing price of $108.39. Investors' reaction to the news was notably positive, reflecting a sense of resilience and confidence in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) future performance despite the revised target. The fact that Feldman maintained a buy rating suggests that he still sees significant potential for growth and value in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock. This sentiment likely resonated with investors, who may have interpreted the price target adjustment as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern.\n\nThe market's strong response to the news underscores the enduring appeal of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) as a leading entertainment and media conglomerate. Despite facing challenges and uncertainties, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) continues to be viewed favorably by investors who recognize its strong brand portfolio, diverse revenue streams, and innovative strategies for content creation and distribution. As such, the price target revision by Goldman Sachs served as a catalyst for renewed investor interest and optimism in Disney's future prospects.\n\n09. Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.67 (+0.97%)\n\nSimilar to the negative outlook on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), analysts express pessimism towards Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY). On February 8, Barclays made headlines within the tech industry by reducing the price target for Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY), an emerging player in the software sector, by $1 from $75.00 to $74.00. Despite this downward adjustment, Barclays opted to maintain an Equal Weight rating for the stock, indicating a neutral stance. Surprisingly, the market's reaction to this news was relatively muted, with Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY) stock price experiencing only a marginal increase of 0.97% compared to its previous closing price of $70.69. While the reduction in price target could be interpreted as a cautious stance on Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY) growth prospects, Barclays' decision to maintain an Equal Weight rating suggests that they still see the company as fairly valued within its industry context. The market's modest response to the price target adjustment may reflect a degree of resilience among investors, who may view the revised target as reflective of current market conditions rather than a significant shift in Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY) long-term outlook. Additionally, Barclays' decision to maintain its rating could signal confidence in Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY) ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the competitive software market. Overall, while the price target cut by Barclays may have initially sparked some uncertainty, the market's subdued reaction suggests that investors remain cautiously optimistic about Dayforce Inc (NYSE:DAY) future trajectory. As the company continues to execute its strategic initiatives and navigate evolving market dynamics, investors will likely monitor closely for further developments that could impact its valuation and performance.\n\n08. Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -1.87 (-1.37%)\n\nOn February 8, Citigroup made waves within the biotech sector by revising down the target price for Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX), a prominent player in the pharmaceutical industry. Citigroup's adjustment saw the target price decrease from $141.00 to $140.00, accompanied by a reaffirmation of a \"neutral\" rating for the stock. Despite this downward revision, the market's response to the news was relatively modest, with Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX) stock price experiencing a slight decline of 1.37% compared to its previous closing price of $132.30. While the reduction in target price might indicate a more conservative outlook on Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX) growth potential, Citigroup's decision to maintain a \"neutral\" rating suggests a balanced perspective on the stock's prospects within the biotech landscape. The market's subdued reaction to the target price cut could reflect a degree of resilience among investors, who may interpret the adjustment as a reflection of current market conditions rather than a significant alteration in Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX) long-term trajectory. Furthermore, Citigroup's decision to uphold its \"neutral\" rating could imply confidence in the company's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities amidst the competitive pharmaceutical environment.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Small Companies Equity Strategy made the following comment about Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBy sector, our returns in Health Care were positive but this was more than offset by poor Industrials stocks.\u00a0Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX) reported positive late-stage clinical study data for its treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a condition which causes the body to not produce enough cortisol, increasing the probability that the company can address a new estimated $1 billion market opportunity.\u201d\n\n07. Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -1.01 (-1.55%)\n\nOn February 8, Needham & Company LLC made an adjustment within the technology industry, particularly impacting Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA). The firm revised down the target price for Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA) from $76.00 to $75.00 while maintaining its \"Buy\" rating for the stock. Despite this downward revision, the market's reaction to the news was relatively restrained, with Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA) stock price experiencing a slight decline of 1.55% compared to its previous closing price of $65.13. While the reduction in target price might suggest a more cautious outlook on Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA) growth potential, Needham & Company LLC's decision to uphold its \"Buy\" rating indicates continued confidence in the stock's investment prospects within the technology sector. The market's muted response to the target price cut suggests that investors may view the adjustment as a minor adjustment rather than a significant shift in Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA) long-term trajectory. Furthermore, Needham & Company LLC's decision to maintain its \"Buy\" rating could signal optimism about Azenta's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the competitive technology landscape.\n\nPolen Global SMID Company Growth Strategy made the following comment about Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur most significant detractors from performance included\u00a0Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA), Netcompany and Endava on both an absolute and relative basis.\n\nWe sold out of Azenta, a company we bought in June 2022. The original buy thesis was that the company could grow organically at a high-teens rate per annum, expand operating margins, and deploy its $2.5B of cash opportunistically in either M&A or buybacks. Cash represented well over 50% of the company\u2019s market capitalization at the time. It was our view that we had a company that was misunderstood given the transition from a Semiconductor company (Brooks Automation) to a Life Science company with great assets. Fundamental performance has been disappointing since our investment; the company pre-announced shortly after our initial purchase, blaming disruptions from China\u2019s lockdowns, and dismissed their COO and a senior sales leader. In the ensuing quarters they reported organic revenue that disappointed with margins moving in the wrong direction. It\u2019s possible that the management team fixes the issues and our sale is poorly timed, however there are plenty of high-quality businesses with attractive valuation elsewhere and we are choosing to deploy the capital where we have higher confidence in both management and a path to great returns.\u201d\n\n06. Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -1.45 (-1.65%)\n\nJust like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), analysts are bearish on Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG). On February 8, BMO Capital Markets, operating within the agricultural industry, made adjustments affecting Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG). The firm reduced Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG) target price from $130.00 to $120.00 while maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating for the stock. Despite this downward revision, the market's response was relatively modest, with Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG) stock price decreasing by 1.65% compared to its previous closing price of $88.45. While the reduction in target price might indicate a slightly more cautious outlook on Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG) growth potential, BMO Capital Markets' continued endorsement of an \"Outperform\" rating suggests confidence in the stock's investment appeal within the agricultural sector. The market's subdued reaction to the target price adjustment suggests that investors may view it as a minor adjustment rather than a significant change in Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG) long-term prospects. Furthermore, BMO Capital Markets' decision to uphold its \"Outperform\" rating could signal optimism about BG's ability to navigate market challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the dynamic agricultural industry. Overall, while BMO Capital Markets' downward revision of Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG) target price may have initially influenced market sentiment, the relatively modest reaction indicates that investors remain relatively positive about the company's future prospects. As Bunge Global SA (NYSE:BG) continues to adapt to evolving market conditions and execute its strategic initiatives, investors will likely monitor for further developments that could impact the stock's valuation and performance.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Car Repair Stocks to Buy Now 11 Best Asset Management Stocks to Buy Now 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Could Alibaba Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA) stock price sank 6% on Feb. 7 after the Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader posted its latest earnings report. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Dec. 31, its revenue rose 5% year over year to 260.35 billion yuan ($36.67 billion) and beat analysts' estimates by $270 million. Its adjusted earnings per ADS dipped 2% to $2.67 but cleared the consensus forecast by $0.03 per share.\n\nAlibaba's headline numbers weren't disastrous, but it's still struggling to revive its core e-commerce and cloud businesses. However, its stock trades just 8% above its IPO price and looks dirt cheap at 10 times next year's earnings. So if you take a contrarian view and invest $10,000 in Alibaba today, could it make you a millionaire over the next 20 years? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat happened to Alibaba?\n\nWhen Alibaba's stock hit its all-time high in October 2020, its Chinese e-commerce marketplaces (Taobao and Tmall) and cloud platform were firing on all cylinders. From fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2020 (which ended in March 2020), its revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46% as its net income rose at a CAGR of 42%.\n\nAlibaba's revenue climbed 41% in fiscal 2021, but its net income only inched up 2% after China's antitrust regulators levied a record $2.75 billion fine against the company. The regulators also barred Alibaba's e-commerce marketplaces from locking in merchants with exclusive deals, using aggressive loss-leading promotions, and making unapproved investments.\n\nThose new restrictions -- along with fierce macro headwinds and intense competition from PDD (NASDAQ: PDD) and JD.com -- curbed the growth of Alibaba's Chinese e-commerce platforms and drove it to expand its overseas marketplaces (Lazada in Southeast Asia, Trendyol in Turkey, and its AliExpress cross-border marketplace) to diversify its e-commerce business away from China.\n\nBut as Alibaba's e-commerce sales cooled off, its cloud segment also faced tougher challenges. The macro headwinds forced many companies to rein in their spending on cloud services; it faced stiff competition from Huawei, Tencent, and Baidu; and it lost major customers like ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) amid the intensifying trade and tech war between the U.S. and China.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen will Alibaba turn a corner?\n\nFaced with those challenges, Alibaba's revenue only increased 19% in fiscal 2022 and 2% in fiscal 2023. To cope with that slowdown, the company restructured itself into six new units, cut costs, and focused on expanding its higher-growth segments. But as the following table illustrates, Alibaba's core businesses continued to struggle over the past year.\n\nRevenue Growth by Segment (YOY) Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Taobao and Tmall 12% 4% 2% International Digital Commerce 41% 53% 44% Cloud Intelligence 4% 2% 3% Cainiao Smart Logistics 34% 25% 24% Local Services 30% 16% 13% Digital Media and Entertainment 36% 11% 18% Total 14% 9% 5%\n\nData source: Alibaba. YOY = year over year. RMB terms.\n\nTaobao and Tmall, which accounted for 48% of its revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, struggled as PDD's Pinduoduo peeled away its domestic shoppers. Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence segment, which generated 11% of its sales, also expanded at a sluggish pace as it \"proactively\" reduced its exposure to its lower-margin industries and customers.\n\nAlibaba's International Digital Commerce business, which produced 10% of its revenue, is still growing rapidly but remains deeply unprofitable. Its Local Services and Digital Media divisions also stayed unprofitable over the past year, while its Cainiao segment finally turned a profit after it implemented some aggressive cost-cutting measures.\n\nCould Alibaba generate millionaire-making gains?\n\nSimply put, Alibaba needs its profitable Taobao/Tmall and Cloud Intelligence segments to grow again and subsidize the expansion of its unprofitable businesses. Unfortunately, China's economic slowdown and the difficult competitive environment could hamper its chances of a near-term recovery. The recent expansion of its buyback plan by $25 billion also suggests it's running out of ways to boost its revenue through shrewd investments or acquisitions.\n\nAssuming Alibaba's valuations remain unchanged, it would need to increase its revenue and earnings at a CAGR of 26% over the next 20 years to turn a $10,000 investment into $1 million. Those growth rates might have seemed achievable in the past, but they could be nearly impossible to attain as its core e-commerce and cloud businesses face daunting macro, regulatory, and competitive challenges.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue to rise at a CAGR of just 8% as its net income increases at a CAGR of 27%. Those growth rates are stable, but investors looking for a higher-growth Chinese e-commerce play with millionaire-making potential should take a closer look at PDD instead of betting on Alibaba's recovery.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Got $5,000? These 3 Stocks Are Near Their 52-Week Lows and Are Underrated Buys",
        "content": "Looking for some deals in the stock market? If you've got $5,000 that you are looking to invest in some established growth stocks, there are some bargains worth considering. Three cheap stocks backed by promising businesses that would make for solid long-term investments right now are Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN).\n\n1. Alibaba Group\n\nChinese stocks have been undervalued for several years due in part to ongoing tensions between China and the U.S. But China is an attractive market to invest in. In the last quarter of 2023, the Chinese economy grew at a rate of 5.2%, compared with 3.3% for the U.S.\n\nGrowth in both economies could slow down this year, but the difference is that while many U.S. growth stocks are overpriced due to better-than-expected economic growth, Alibaba remains discounted. Investors can get the e-commerce giant for an incredibly cheap valuation of less than 8 times its expected future profits. By comparison, the S&P 500 averages a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.\n\nAlibaba has a broad business that includes online shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall, along with digital media and a growing cloud infrastructure business that 80% of China's technology companies rely on. Alibaba also makes for an underrated AI stock, as it has been working on its own chatbot, Tongyi Qianwen.\n\nAlthough its growth rate has been modest in recent periods, often below 10%, Alibaba's potential remains promising in the long run. Buying the stock now, while it trades near its 52-week low of $66.63, could be an excellent move for long-term investors.\n\n2. United Parcel Service\n\nUnited Parcel Service, also known as UPS, is also trading at a modest multiple -- less than 17 times its future expected profits, UPS is also around $10 away from its 52-week low of $133.68.\n\nThe company is coming off a tough quarter. Its Q4 revenue was $24.9 billion -- down from $27 billion in the prior-year period. But geopolitical issues and challenging economic conditions have weighed on demand for its services.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement is forecasting a minor improvement this year, projecting 2024 revenue of between $92 billion and $94.5 billion, up from the $91 billion it reported in 2023. But in the longer run, as geopolitical conditions improve and e-commerce picks up, demand should be even stronger.\n\nAs a leader in the logistics industry, UPS plays a key role in the U.S. economy's growth, which is why it's a good stock to hold in your portfolio for the long haul. Investors would be well-advised to follow Warren Buffett's wisdom of betting on America. While UPS' business is facing challenges right now, these aren't problems that should hold the company down.\n\n3. AstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca is a top healthcare company, but it's not trading like one. Investors can buy its stock for less than 16 times its estimated future profits, and just a few dollars above its 52-week low of $61.73.\n\nWhat's promising about the business is that it is broad and contains many different growth opportunities. The company's business encompasses products in multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology; cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism; rare diseases; respiratory and immunology; and vaccines and immune therapies.\n\nThe company has many blockbuster drugs in its catalog: Through just the first nine months of 2023, Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Calquence, Farxiga, Symbicort, Fasenra, Soliris, and Ultomiris, had all already breached the $1 billion mark in annual sales. And with 167 projects in its research and development pipeline, expect the company to add to that tally in the future. Over the last four reported quarters, the company has generated nearly $45 billion in revenue, with net income totaling just under $5.9 billion.\n\nWith an extensive pipeline and a modest valuation, AstraZeneca appears to be an overlooked stock that could make for a great option for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA reported third-quarter fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings of $2.67 per ADS (RMB 18.97), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.2%. The figure decreased 2% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure in RMB terms.\r\n\r\nRevenues of RMB 260.35 billion ($36.7 billion) rose 5% from the year-ago quarter. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.2 billion.\r\n\r\nThe top-line increase was driven by solid momentum across the international commerce retail business. Strength across the local services and Cainiao logistics services businesses also contributed well. The strong performance of the Digital Media and Entertainment Group segment was a positive.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish growth in the China commerce business was a major concern.\r\n\r\nShares of Alibaba have lost 30.8% over a year against the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s return of 26.2%.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nRevenues by Segments\n\nTaobao and Tmall Group (49.6% of the total revenues): The segment comprises Taobao, Tmall, Xianyu, 1688.com and other businesses operating in China\u2019s retail and wholesale markets.

The improvement was attributed to rising direct sales and other revenues. Also, growing online GMV on Taobao and Tmall was a positive and benefited the customer management business, offset by a decreasing take rate.\r\n\r\nChina commerce wholesale (2% of the total revenues): The business generated revenues of RMB 5.31 billion ($747 million), which grew 23% on a year-over-year basis. This was attributed to increasing revenues from value-added services.\r\n\r\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (11% of the total revenues): The segment comprises Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Alibaba.com, and other businesses operating in the international retail and wholesale markets. Alibaba generated RMB 28.52 billion ($4.02 billion) in revenues from the segment, which grew 44% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nInternational commerce retail (8.9% of the total revenues): Revenues for the reported quarter were RMB 23.3 billion ($3.3 billion), up 56% from the year-ago fiscal quarter\u2019s reported figure, owing to solid combined order growth in AIDC\u2019s retail businesses. Also, the strong momentum in AliExpress\u2019 Choice was a positive.\r\n\r\nInternational commerce wholesale (2% of the total revenues): The business generated revenues of RMB 5.26 billion ($740 million), which increased 8% on a year-over-year basis. Strength in cross-border-related value-added services contributed well.\r\n\r\nLocal Services Group (5.8% of the total revenues): The segment\u2019s revenues grossed RMB 15.2 billion ($2.14 billion), up 13% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was driven by strong order growth in Ele.me and Amap businesses.\r\n\r\nCainiao Smart Logistics Network (10.9% of the total revenues): Revenues summed up to RMB 28.5 billion ($4.01 billion), up 24% from the year-ago quarter. The upside was led by a solid momentum across cross-border fulfillment solutions.\r\n\r\nCloud Intelligence Group (10.8% of the total revenues): The segment generated revenues of RMB 28.1 billion ($3.95 billion), up 3% from the year-ago quarter. This was attributed to strength across Alibaba\u2019s consolidated businesses.\r\n\r\nDigital Media and Entertainment Group (1.9% of the total revenues): Revenues logged RMB 5.04 billion ($710 million), increasing 18% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. This was driven by strength in the offline entertainment businesses of Alibaba Pictures.\r\n\r\nAll Others (18.1% of the total revenues): The segment\u2019s revenues were RMB 47.02 billion ($6.6 billion), down 7% from the year-ago quarter.

        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alibaba (BABA).\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.27, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.27 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy, representing 86.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for BABA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for BABA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Alibaba, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in BABA?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.86.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alibaba.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "$200 Million Insider Bet, Massive Buybacks Point to an Alibaba Revival",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) has witnessed a substantial drop in its stock price for more than three years, primarily driven by the sudden suspension of Ant Group's highly anticipated $37 billion initial public offering and the implementation of strict regulatory measures on prominent Chinese tech companies in late 2020.\n\nGlobal economic headwinds and a noticeable deceleration in the company's growth momentum further exacerbated the situation. Alibaba's stock plummeted by an astonishing 76% from its peak in October 2020.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nOver the past two years, the company has grappled with a deceleration in revenue growth attributable to widespread economic headwinds and intensifying market competition.\n\nYet, the evolving regulatory climate has primarily driven the sharp downturn in its share price. This period of regulatory uncertainty took root with the abrupt cancellation of Ant Group's IPO and deepened with the reversal of IPO plans for its other subsidiaries.\n\nHowever, these developments have significantly impacted investor confidence, leading to adisproportionate focus on regulatory challenges over the company's operational performance and growth prospects.\n\nLastly, Alibaba is embarking on a remarkable comeback journey marked by rising revenue, improved margins and a growing global presence.\n\nA strategic $200 million vote of confidence amid market challenges\n\nThe co-founders of Alibaba, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, showed confidence in its long-term potential as they collectively invested $200 million to purchase additional shares, signifying their belief in the company's resilience and prospects.\n\nPreviously, Ma's family trust announced its plan to sell 10 million shares in November 2023, an arrangement made with a broker at a price set in August 2023 for thee fund requirement to invest in agricultural enterprises and charities.\n\nOn the contrary, Ma's conviction in Alibaba has been reaffirmed through his recent purchases of company shares, solidifying his position. Specifically, he invested $50 million in Alibaba's shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, while Joe Tsai committed $151 million via his Blue Pool Management family investment vehicle to the company's shares traded in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock purchases by the founders are significant as they signal their belief in the long-term potential of Alibaba amid a challenging market environment. Hence, this move is expected to boost investor confidence and market sentiment toward the company and the broader tech sector in China.\n\nUnsurprisingly, following the news, the company's shares gained 8% and volume increased by 94.20% to 53 million on the New York Stock Exchange. $200 Million Insider Bet, Massive Buybacks Point to an Alibaba Revival\n\nAdditionally, Ant's IPO now shows the possibility of a reboot after the company conducted corporate governance optimization at the beginning of 2023, reducing Ma's voting rights to about 6.20% from his earlier 53.50% holding.\n\nAs per the domestic market rule, companies cannot go public domestically on the country's A-share market if they have had a change in control in thepast three years for Hong Kong's stock exchange; the waiting period is one year. Hence, Ant now has more potential to go public as the issues with the shareholding structure have been resolved and confirmed by the country's central bank.\n\nCurrently, many catalysts for Alibaba are underappreciated in the market, which signifies an undervalued opportunity. The company continues its share buybacks and expands shareholder returns, displays a recovery in revenue growth with a steady margin and awaits potential value-unlocking opportunities through its subsidiary Cainiao's IPO, which is still a work in progress, and new hope for Ant's IPO.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese monetary authorities' continuing expansionary policy with the recent cut in reserve requirements and a stock market stimulus package is bringing new impetus to the overall market, and Alibaba is trading at a depressed price.\n\nAlibaba's billion-dollar buyback: A confidence boost for shareholders and EPS growth\n\nAlibaba announced its fiscal third-quarter earnings earlier this week, beating and raising $36.67 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.67 per share for the three months ended Dec. 31. Despite the modest constant currency top-line growth of 5% and U.S. dollar terms of 2.10%, the stock experienced a pre-market rally that could be primarily associated with the announcement of the massive buybacks.\n\nIn its latest fiscal quarter, the company showcased resilience and strategic growth. It reported a 3% year-over-year increase in cloud intelligence revenue to approximately $3.95 billion, emphasizing a shift toward high-quality revenue streams. Despite retracting plans to spin off its cloud business amid U.S. export restrictions, Alibaba is realigning its operations, which is evident in the recent restructuring into six units and the new management team for Taobao and Tmall Group, which saw 2% revenue growth to $18.18 billion.\n\nThe conglomerate's core e-commerce sector demonstrated robust performance, with online gross merchancise value witnessing healthy growth, driven by increased transacting buyers and order volume. The Chinese retail and wholesale commerce businesses grew by 1% and 23% year over year, respectively. International Digital Commerce surged by 44%, while Local Services Group and Cainiao Smart Logistics Network saw revenue grow by 13% and 24%. The Digital Media and Entertainment segment also experienced an 18% revenue increase, showcasing the company's successful diversification and strategic focus on operational efficiency and global market expansion. $200 Million Insider Bet, Massive Buybacks Point to an Alibaba Revival\n\nSource: Alibaba's third-quarter report\n\nThe company's shares had been volatile, with a 52-week low of $67, but the insider purchases by Ma and Tsai gave the stock fuel to make up the difference. Alibaba has reported a free cash flow of nearly $24 billion over the past year, with nearly half of those funds returned to its investors through roughly $9.50 billion in stock repurchases and $2.50 billion in dividends paid out in January 2024. Hence, the company is preparing for a highly aggressive reinvestment and, therefore, the redeployment of expectations concerning how aggressive its stock buybacks will be.\n\nThat said, even as it poured another $25 billion into its repurchase program, taking the total to some $35 billion with a deadline of March 2027, management mapped a path to reduce the net share count by 3% per year over the next three years. The $25 billion offers a 13% buyback yield, which can support and boost Alibaba's stock over the long term.\n\nThrough such good and salient buybacks and dividend payouts, the company, with an emphasis on shareholders' value, shows a consistent effort to enrich its investors through its comprehensive approach. With a strategic growth-oriented focus and some operational shifts, Alibaba's overall effort indicates a multi-sided approach to maintaining and improving future shareholder returns.\n\nThe potential IPO of Cainiao Smart Logistics and China's big stimulus may unlock valuation\n\nIn August, Cainiao Smart Logistics, a subsidiary of Alibaba, made a strategic move by filing for an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This IPO holds the potential to elevate Alibaba's valuation given Cainiao's impressive track record of robust revenue growth and improving margins.\n\nNotably, while Alibaba reconsidered and ultimately decided against spinning off its cloud segment, the IPO for Cainiao is in progress. On Nov. 14, China's securities watchdog asked Cainiao to submit additional information about its shareholders and operational structure, indicating the IPO potential is still alive.\n\nThe logistics giant aims to raise at least $1 billion, depending on the prevailing market conditions. After the proposed spin-off, Alibaba intends to maintain a controlling interest in Cainiao, with ownership of over 50% (Alibaba currently holds approximately 70% of Cainiao).\n\nLeading financial institutions China International Capital Corp. (HKSE:03908) and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) are partnering with Cainiao to facilitate its initial share sale. With an approximate valuation of $20 billion, Cainiao's robust financial standing is evident from its $12.4 billion revenue recorded over the 12 months up to September 2023. Further highlighting its financial vigor, Cainiao's adjusted Ebita margin has significantly improved, climbing to 4% in the second quarter of 2024 from just 0.7% in the same quarter of 2023, a testament to its growing operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nIf and when it happens, the confirmation of the Cainiao IPO may give a new boost to the stock price, as it did when Alibaba planned to split into six groups. After the split announcement, Alibaba's stock price went up by 14.30% from the previous day, and trade volume rose by 551.10%, indicating investors' rejuvenated optimism until the company decided to walk back on the plan. The Cainiao IPO has the same potential to boost the stock price when the market gains a sense of certainty over the listing.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese authorities are considering plans to stimulate the equity market, which has gone through a series of setbacks over the last few years. The policymakers seek to inject $278 billion from the offshore accounts of Chinese state-owned enterprises as part of a stabilization fund to buy shares onshore through the Hong Kong exchange link.\n\nMoreover, expansionary monetary policy by the central bank, as continued by the recent cut in reserve ratio requirements by 50 basis points, which will free up $140 billion, will further boost the capital market, making way for unlocking the valuation of many high-quality stocks, including Alibaba, which has gone through an extended depressed period. Hence, the expansionary monetary policy will work as a catalyst for the company's business.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAmid regulatory challenges and market volatility, Alibaba Group has demonstrated remarkable resilience, underscored by co-founders Ma and Tsai's significant share purchase, signaling strong confidence in the company's future. This move, along with a substantial buyback program, highlights Alibaba's commitment to shareholder value and its strategic vision for growth. Despite a historic stock price decline, Alibaba is on a path to recovery, driven by operational realignment, potential IPOs of its subsidiaries and favorable monetary policies. These factors collectively signal Alibaba's readiness to leverage its strengths for a robust comeback and long-term success.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Many U.S.-listed Hong stocks have suffered substantial losses over the previous years as Chinese equities have continuously declined. The trend was exacerbated by last year\u2019s ordered liquidation of heavily indebted property developer Evergrande (OTCMKTS:EGRNY). It deteriorated even further to see outflows from Chinese and Hong Kong stocks reaching their highest since 2014 in January. It marked the sixth consecutive month of net capital leaving the country.\n\nHowever, U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks rose on Tuesday. It followed the Chinese government announcing various measures to support the stock exchange. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index saw a rise of 4%, whereas Mainland China\u2019s CSI 300 accelerated by 3.48%. Measures taken included state-owned enterprises purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The securities regulator even stated they would \u201cencourage\u201d companies to buy shares.\n\nBefore the support measures were announced, hedge funds had already purchased large volumes of Chinese businesses, primarily with listed shares or American depositary receipts (ADRs). Hedge funds invested almost $12 billion over January 23-25 in ADRs, A-shares, and Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. Naturally, this included U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks. The 3-day frenzy marked the biggest purchase in five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFollowing the announcement, U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks extended recent gains at Wednesday\u2019s open. In recent trading, the Hang Seng index price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has decreased from around 10.50 at the beginning of January to 9.98. This suggests that various U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks could be undervalued and poised to reverse.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the share price of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) having declined 77% from its 2020 peak, its stock is currently trading at a pierce-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 10.8. In contrast, its largest American counterpart, Amazon, trades at a PE ratio of 58.3.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts foresee potential upside for BABA as the company expands its cloud segment and AI initiatives. The average price target implies around 60% growth, making the U.S.-listed Hong Kong stock a favorable choice.\n\nAside from optimism amongst analysts, Alibaba\u2019s founders, Jack Ma, and Joe Tsai, have recently purchased $200 million worth of stock.\n\nNetEase (NTES) man in suit holding a tablet with graphic above showing oversold stocks to buy\n\nSource: undefined undefined / Getty Images\n\nThe U.S.-listed Hong Kong stock NetEase (NYSE:NTES) trades at a PE ratio of 18.2 compared to its American counterpart, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), which has a PE ratio of 34. Despite economic headwinds, NetEase grew its EPS 26% annually over three years and improved profit margins. The company also grew its EBIT margins, generating more profits from increasing sales.\n\nInsiders, including management, own 46% of NetEase\u2019s shares. This strongly aligns with other shareholders\u2019 interests, suggesting the company is motivated to create shareholder value. While NTES\u2019 performance looks promising, some analysts note that insider buying would provide further confidence. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts estimate a 30% share price increase\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NYSE:BIDU), the Chinese technology giant, trades at a PE ratio of 17.9. There is no directly comparable American company to Baidu, given its operations span search engine, cloud storage, social media and artificial intelligence development. However, similar companies may include Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), which trades at a PE ratio of 24.9; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a PE ratio of 36.5; and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), with a PE ratio of 30.6.\u200b\n\nThe U.S.-listed Hong Kong stock has declined nearly 70% from its early 2021 high, with a further drop of almost 12% in January amid the broader downturn in Chinese equities. However, analysts maintain a positive outlook for the company. This is partly due to Baidu reporting $26 billion in cash and liquid assets in its most recent earnings. The consensus price target among analysts is $167.66 per share, representing an upside of just under 60% from current levels.\u200b\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited Earnings Missed Analyst Estimates: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Now",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 2.3% to US$70.78 in the week after its latest third-quarter results. It looks like a pretty bad result, all things considered. Although revenues of CN\u00a5260b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings fell badly short, missing estimates by 62% to hit CN\u00a55.65 per share. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the 54 analysts covering Alibaba Group Holding are now predicting revenues of CN\u00a51.02t in 2025. If met, this would reflect a decent 10.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 24% to CN\u00a549.42. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of CN\u00a51.03t and earnings per share (EPS) of CN\u00a553.84 in 2025. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year.\n\nThe consensus price target held steady at US$110, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Alibaba Group Holding, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$150 and the most bearish at US$79.98 per share. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Alibaba Group Holding's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 7.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 18% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 11% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Alibaba Group Holding.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Alibaba Group Holding. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Alibaba Group Holding going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether management and directors have been buying or selling stock recently.

        "content": "Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) released its latest set of quarterly results late Wednesday, and investors reacted by trading the big Chinese company's stock down the following day. Across that trading session the price of its American depositary shares (ADSes) declined by almost 4%, against an essentially flat-lining S&P 500 index.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue rose, adjusted net income dipped\n\nFor its fourth quarter, Alibaba posted total revenue of just over 260.3 billion yuan ($36.56 billion), which was up by 5% year over year. According to non-GAAP (adjusted) standards, it netted slightly under 48 billion yuan ($6.7 billion), representing a 2% dip from the same quarter of 2022. On a per-ADS basis, that adjusted net income figure was 18.97 yuan ($2.66).\n\nNeither headline figure met analyst expectations. On average, the prognosticators tracking the sprawling tech stock were modeling a slightly higher top-line result of nearly 260.7 billion yuan ($36.61 billion) and an adjusted, per-ADS net income of 19.17 yuan ($2.69).\n\nIn the quarter, the largest of Alibaba's business units -- the Taobao and Tmall domestic e-commerce operations -- saw its revenue rise by a fairly anemic 2% to almost 123.8 billion yuan ($17.4 billion). It had more success with the international digital commerce group that runs the popular AliExpress online retail site, however even with 44% year-over-year growth its tally was relatively low at less than 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion).\n\nThe $25 billion added to stock buyback authorization didn't impress\n\nAlibaba didn't proffer any guidance in the earnings release. It did, however, briefly address its future strategy by quoting CEO Eddie Wu as saying that \"We will step up investment to improve users' core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen market leadership in the coming year.\"\n\nOne big move the company made is increasing its share buyback program by a substantial $25 billion. That, however, didn't seem to move investors unimpressed with the quarter's performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript February 7, 2024\n\nOperator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Alibaba Group's December Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After managements prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Lin, Head of Investor Relations of Alibaba Group. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Lin: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Alibaba Group's December quarter 2023 results conference call. With us are Joe Tsai, Chairman; Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer; Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer. We have also invited Jiang Fan, CEO of Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, AIDC, to join the call. This call is also being webcasted on the IR section of our corporate website.

Today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements including without limitation, statements about our new organization and government structure, strategies and business plans as well as our beliefs and expectations about our business prospects such as the future growth of our business, revenue and return on investment.\n\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For detailed discussions of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our latest annual report on Form 20-F and other documents filed with the U.S. SEC. or announced on the website of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update these statements, except as required under applicable law. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITA, adjusted EBITA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share or ADS and free cash flow are expressed on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur GAAP results and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measure can be found in earnings press release. Unless otherwise stated, growth rate of all stated metrics mentioned during this call refers to year-over-year growth versus the same quarter last year. With that, I will now turn to Eddie.\n\nEddie Wu: Hello, everyone. Over this past quarter, we delivered steady growth while making organizational adjustments that align with our strategic focus. At the same time, we took a deep look at our core business operations and the competitive landscape. We concluded that to maintain our competitive edge, we increase our investment in core capabilities and adopt a more aggressive approach towards competition in order to win growth. Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our two core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. During the quarter, the execution of our user-first and competitive pricing strategies in Taobao and Tmall Group, TTG was effective resulting in healthy year-over-year GMV growth as the number of active buyers and order volume showed a robust increase.\n\nThe number of merchants continue to grow at a double-digit rate, and I'll elaborate on the outlook and plans for 2024 in a moment. In Cloud Computing, we're committed to our strategy of prioritizing public cloud. We have proactively optimized our business structure, reduced revenue from project-based contracts and increased investment in public cloud products. These structural adjustments are showing results and Alibaba Cloud's overall profitability capability continues to improve. We've also upgraded Alibaba Cloud's sales operations establishing different sales and service systems to serve different types and sizes of customers by improving our customer coverage and service capabilities, we will enhance our growth rate. In the International Commerce business, we focused on expanding cross-border offerings and enhancing the shopping experience.\n\nThis quarter, all of AIDC's retail platforms achieved growth resulting in international digital commerce overall revenues growing at a rapid rate of 44% year-over-year. Cainiao continued to develop its global smart logistics network with cross-border logistics fulfillment solutions contributing to 24% and year-over-year revenue growth as well as realizing strong synergies with the cross-border e-commerce business. Next, I'd like to share the strategic priorities for TTG in investing and capturing growth opportunities. TTG operates in the world's most competitive e-commerce market, which is China. As we carefully evaluate TTG's competitive position within the China e-commerce market, we note that TTG continues to be number one in GMV share and is the leading platform for consumer shopping.\n\nMerchants operate on the platform as their primary place of e-commerce business, and TTG has the deepest and most comprehensive selection of products amongst its peers. However, we must still make targeted investments and improvements in price competitiveness, service and user experience. Given that consumers use multiple platforms, returning to a user-centric approach is at the heart of our strategy. We'll increase investment in core user experiences to enhance the customer shopping experience. I'm confident that by focusing on delivering the incredible Taobao or universal Taobao experience, offering quality products at attractive prices with great service meeting the different needs of different consumer segments, TTG will earn users' trust and return to growth.\n\nThus, 2024 will be a year of comprehensive capability upgrades for TTG and also a year of significant investment and we'll be prioritizing investment in the following areas. One, product supply. And we'll increase our investments in growing the selection of branded and products and direct for manufacturer products on TTG's platform. This will further strengthen our product supply advantages to better address new consumption trends and demands. Two, competitive pricing and efficiency. We'll increase investment into product sourcing capabilities and optimizing business model relationships between merchants and our platform. For different types of suppliers, we'll offer flexible business models that are best suited to improve their operational efficiency and thereby enhance Taobao's value proposition.\n\nThe competitive pricing we're focused on delivering is attractive prices for quality products. This is a demand that consumers have across cycles and is fundamental to doing business. Three, quality service. We will work with our merchants and logistics partners to invest in improving the entire consumer service experience including presale, in-sale, post-sale and logistics. For different customer segments on the platform, we will build a consumer service system that accurately identifies and meets the various needs of the different groups. Fourth, increased purchase frequency. Through the above investments, we will enhance our comprehensive capabilities to offer quality products at attractive prices with great service. We believe that improving the platform's overall shopping experience and service quality will lead to increased purchase frequency and materially improve the efficiency of user growth.\n\nToday, Taobao and Tmall remain the most valuable shopping platforms and the main place for merchants to do business. With the comprehensive capability planning -- building plan for 2024, we're confident that TTG will return to growth. Next, I'll hand over to Jiang Fan to present on ADC.\n\nJiang Fan: Good evening, everybody. Over the past quarter, despite the uncertain international environment and more intense market competition, AIDC achieved rapid growth. Total orders grew by 24% year-on-year driven by strong growth across all major retail platforms. Growth in our cross-border business was especially significant. Our three major growth drivers are; first, enhanced consumer experience as a result of our business model and supply chain services upgrade; second, product and technology innovation; and third, our targeted expansion in priority markets. Next, I will present our business results and future development plans around these three drivers. First is our business model and supply chain services upgrade. Last quarter, AliExpress achieved year-on-year order growth of over 60%.\n\nThis was mainly driven by the new AE Choice model that we launched in early 2023. The AE Choice model is, in essence, an upgrade that we made to our original pure platform model into a hybrid business model that combines POP on the one hand with a fully entrusted model on the other and it's underpinned by supply chain efficiency. It optimizes supply on the platform by balancing experience with richness of offerings. By offering entrusted cross-border logistics, marketing and other services, we lower the barrier for merchants to engage in cross-border business, bringing more certainty to their operations and more diverse assortment to the platform. At the same time, we continue to enhance the end-to-end consumer experience including by providing more stable product quality and more competitive prices by continuing to optimize delivery time and by adding value-added services like local product return.\n\nAs of January 2024 choice already made up half of all AliExpress orders. It's a high-quality user experience has driven significant user growth and transaction growth on the AliExpress platform. And going forward, we'll continue to invest resolutely to further increase choice penetration and provide a better experience to more users. In terms of product and technology innovation, AIDC serves consumers in different countries and regions around the world. We've already optimized products in certain key countries and regions in line with local preferences. These efforts have been highly appreciated, and we'll continue to pursue that kind of innovation and upgrading. We're also actively deploying AI to enhance operating efficiency and lower barriers for merchants. An e-commerce platform displaying a wide range of products to customers online.\n\nOur suite of AI-based digital foreign trade products have been officially launched, enabling real-time language translation AI and logistics services, rapid generation of images and videos for marketing, et cetera. Third, sustained growth in key markets. In the last quarter, we achieved good growth in different regional markets. And in certain key markets, A achieved breakthrough rapid growth to become the leading platform locally. In Turkey and neighboring markets, Trendyol continue to achieve robust double-digit order growth and maintained its leading position in the Turkish market. It also further expanded its business in valuable new markets in the Middle East. In Europe, alibaba.com completed its acquisition of the well-known European B2B digital trade platform, Visable, further expanding its supplier base in the region and further advancing alibaba.com's global expansion and dual brand strategy.\n\nThere is huge potential for AIDC to increase user penetration in the majority of overseas markets, building on our current resources and footprint, we will increase our investment in select regional markets where we see opportunities and value to achieve opportunities for high certainty and healthy growth. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain our rapid growth momentum and provide consumers with improved differentiated services. To that end, we'll continue to increase our investments in enhancing user experience and business competitiveness while expanding our business scale.\n\nToby Xu: Thank you, Jonathan. We achieved a healthy financial performance in the past quarter, driven by steady business momentum and improving operating efficiency in several major businesses. Total consolidated revenue was RMB260.3 billion, an increase of 5%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% to RMB52.8 billion. Our non-GAAP net income was RMB48 billion, a decrease of 4%. Our GAAP net income was RMB10.7 billion, a decrease of RMB35 billion. That was primarily attributable to change in investment values and impairments. Firstly, there was a market-to-market change from our equity investments of about RMB19 billion; second, amortization impairment of intangible assets was RMB14.6 billion, of which RMB12.1 billion was related to Sun Art impairments.\n\nThird, impairment of goodwill was RMB8.5 billion related to Youku. The above three items were excluded from non-GAAP net income. As of December 31 2023, we continue to maintain a strong net cash position of RMB487 billion or $68.6 billion. Free cash flow this quarter was RMB56.5 billion, a decrease of 31%. The decrease in free cash flow was attributed to increased CapEx in several onetime factors, including timing of income tax payments and working capital changes related to several of our businesses. Now let's look at the segment results. Starting with Taobao and Tmall Group. Revenue for Taobao and Tmall Group was RMB129.1 billion, an increase of 2%. During this quarter, we made steady progress to execute our Taobao and Tmall strategies. We observed a few positive trends.\n\nAs Eddie mentioned, our online GMV achieved healthy growth with order volume growing strongly during the quarter. Notably, the order volume exited double-digit year-over-year growth during the second half of the quarter. Importantly, we continued our efforts to onboard our wide range of brands and merchants. The number of operating merchants on our platform continued to grow at double digits, and this trend has sustained over the past four quarters. Additionally, we are also seeing strong growth in paying merchants. Customer management revenue was RMB92.1 billion, relatively flat year-over-year. The overall take rate decreased slightly year-over-year mainly because of the increase in GMV came from Taobao merchants. The mix shift of GMV towards Taobao merchants provide us with further monetization potential because the take rate from Taobao merchants has been improving, while Tmall merchants take rate was unchanged during the quarter.\n\nImportantly, this trend also reflects increasing consumer demand of price-competitive products offered on our platform. Direct sales and other revenue increased 2% to RMB31.6 billion. China commerce wholesale business revenue increased 23% to RMB5.3 billion, primarily due to an increase in revenue from value-added services of 1688.com. Taobao and Tmall Group adjusted EBITDA increased by 1% to RMB59.9 billion. The increase was primarily due to the narrowing losses in certain businesses partly offset by the increasing investment in content, user acquisition and retention of Taobao EPP as well as technological innovation. We are in the process or revitalizing Taobao and Tmall Group and position it for future growth. We are beginning to see early signs of GMV growth recovery driven in part by investment made since earlier this fiscal year.\n\nWe still have a lot of work ahead. As Eddie mentioned, we will invest for future growth and strengthen Taobao and Tmall Group's market leadership. Our Cloud Intelligence Group's revenue quality continues to improve as we proactively reduced revenue from low-margin project-based contracts. Additionally, we recorded healthy growth of our public cloud revenue from external customers. Revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB28.1 billion this quarter, an increase of 3%. Cloud's adjusted EBITA increased by 86% to RMB2.4 billion. The continuous improvement in our adjusted EBITDA reflected improving product mix through our focus on public cloud and operating efficiency, but enhance the profitability of Cloud business gives us confidence to invest in technology and customers to strengthen our public cloud leadership in the future.\n\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group revenue was RMB28.5 billion, an increase of 44%. Revenue from International Commerce Retail Business increased by 56% to RMB23.3 billion, the increase in revenue was primarily due to solid revenue growth from AliExpress, especially Choice business and Trendyol. Revenue from our International Commerce Wholesale business increased by 8% to RMB5.3 billion, the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by cross-border related value-added services from alibaba.com. AIDC's adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB3.1 billion. Losses increased primarily because of the increase in investment in AliExpress Choice, Trendyol's international business partly offset by improvement in monetization across all major platforms.\n\nOverall, we have seen a very rapid order and revenue growth of our AIDC cross-border e-commerce business over the last few quarters. To sustain this momentum and provide differentiated services to customers, we increased the investment during this quarter, and we'll step up investments to drive further growth. Total revenue from Cainiao grew 24% to RMB28.5 billion, primarily contributed by the increase in revenue from cross-border fulfillment solutions. Cainiao adjusted EBITDA was RMB961 million compared to a loss of RMB12 million in the same quarter last year. The increase reflected economies of scale that leads to cost optimization as well as optimize operating expenditure spending in the coming quarters as a strategic partner of AliExpress.\n\nWe will increase investments in expanding our cross-border logistics capabilities to support a Choice's growth. Local services group revenue in December quarter grew 13% to RMB15.2 billion, driven by healthy growth of Ele.me and rapid growth of Amap. Local service Group adjusted EBITDA was a loss of RMB2.1 billion this quarter compared to a loss of RMB2.9 billion same quarter last year, primarily due to the continued narrowing of loss from our two home business, driven by Ele.me improved unit economics and increasing scale. Revenue from our DME group was RMB5 billion, an increase of 18%, primarily driven by the strong revenue growth of off-line entertainment businesses. Adjusted EBITA was a loss of RMB517 million compared to a loss of RMB391 million same quarter last year.\n\nLosses increased primarily due to the increased losses of Youku. Revenue from all other segments decreased 7% to RMB47 billion, mainly due to the decrease in revenue from Sun Art. Adjusted EBITDA from all other segments was a loss of RMB3.2 billion compared to a loss of RMB1.7 billion in the same quarter last year primarily due to increase in year-over-year loss from Sun Art due to scale down of certain of businesses. Excluding Sun Art, flushable and in-time businesses that have physical retail operations, group revenue would have grown at approximately 8% in our group consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 4 percentage points higher at approximately 24% this quarter. Lastly, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nWe have been consistently buying back shares. In the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, we have repurchased $9.5 billion in shares and have reduced the share account by 3.3% of accounting for shares issued under our ESOP. Additionally, quarter-to-date until February 6th, we have repurchased another $1.4 billion worth of our shares. Our Board of Directors has approved upsize of the share repurchase program by another $25 billion through March 2027, upsizing our share repurchase program demonstrates our strong confidence in our business fundamentals and cash flow generation capability. Following the upsize, we currently have $35.3 billion available under our share repurchase program. The upsize program will allow us to achieve a net reduction in share count and achieve EPS and cash flow per share accretion.\n\nSubject to market conditions, we target to achieve at least 3% in annual reduction in total shares outstanding for the next three fiscal years. Thank you. That's the end of our prepared remarks. We can open up for Q&A.\n\nRob Lin: Everyone, for today's call, you are welcome to ask questions in Chinese or English.

        "content": "Alibaba downgraded, Disney upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nNeedham upgraded Disney (DIS) to Buy from Hold with a $120 price target based on expectations for \"strong\" 23% 2024 EPS growth, driven by additional cost savings, direct-to-consumer streaming breakeven by Q4 with \"double-digit\" margins at maturity and 5.5M-6M new subscribers from Charter (CHTR) in fiscal Q2. Barclays upgraded Roblox (RBLX) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $46, up from $26. The firm notes company had a constructive investor day in November and reported \"robust\" Q4 results on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs also upgraded Roblox to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $48, up from $35, post the Q4 report. Morgan Stanley upgraded Discover (DFS) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $133, up from $105 as a new analyst at the firm assumed primary coverage. Following Q4 reporting, the firm is incrementally more bullish on prospects of a softer credit landing and identifies Ally (ALLY) and Discover as two ways to play that theme. TD Cowen upgraded Spirit AeroSystems(SPR) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $35, up from $27. The firm cites the company's enhanced cash flow prospects for the upgrade. Stifel upgraded Idex Corp.(IEX) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $265, up from $215. After a challenging 2023, the firm sees a return to growth in the second half of 2024 with upside to current guidance from market recovery, margin expansion with typically high incremental margins early in the cycle, and a return to double-digit organic earnings growth in 2025.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nMacquarie downgraded Alibaba (BABA) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $85.40, down from $88.50, following the company's Q3 results. Alibaba is balancing defense and expansion, which potentially caps earnings upside for now, the firm says. Morgan Stanley downgraded American Express(AXP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $222, up from $212 as a new analyst at the firm assumed primary coverage. AmEx shares have outperformed peers since earnings, as management guided 2024 top-line growth above a slowdown investors feared, EPS guidance came in better-than-expected and the company raised its dividend by 17% in a sign of confidence, notes the firm, which now sees good news baked into the price. Citi downgraded ZoomInfo (ZI) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $13, down from $20. The firm says leading indicators for ZoomInfo, including web traffic and competitive inputs, continue to trend weaker. Wedbush downgraded GoPro (GPRO) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $2, down from $4. The company's prior sales growth targets appear unlikely in 2024 and possibly beyond, while its margin expansion opportunities are limited, the firm says. Morgan Stanley downgraded Hertz (HTZ) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $10, down from $15. Following Q4 results, follow-up calls with management, channel checks, and further negative EV data points, the firm believes the risks to Hertz's business outlook are \"more in balance with the potential reward.\"\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nOppenheimer initiated coverage of Cedar Fair(FUN) with an Outperform rating and $49 price target. The firm views Cedar Fair as an \"interesting investment opportunity\" into the merger with Six Flags (SIX). Scotiabank initiated coverage of Bio-Techne (TECH) with an Outperform rating and $80 price target. The firm, which cites the company's \"industry-leading top-line growth and margin profiles,\" believes Bio-Techne is one of the best positioned companies to outperform the life science tools market growth. B. Riley initiated coverage of Torrid (CURV) with a Buy rating and $7 price target, representing 35% upside potential. The firm believes Torrid is a \"largely undiscovered, underappreciated company and stock.\" Barclays initiated coverage of PNM Resources(PNM) with an Overweight rating and $40 price target. The company is the \"premier way\" to benefit from Texas growth via small caps, the firm tells investors in a research note. Ladenburg initiated coverage of Biodexa Pharmaceuticals(BDRX) with a Buy rating and $8 price target. The \"boring\" Type 1 Diabetes, or T1D, market has been dominated by commoditized insulin variations for decades, but the recently approved Tzield with an FDA label implying the delay of the onset of Stage 3 T1D \"opened the door for multiple therapeutic options,\" says the firm, which notes that Biodexa recently in-licensed a Lyn kinase activator named tolimidone that was previously developed by Pfizer (PFE).",

        "content": "SINGAPORE, Feb. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0AliExpress order volume has increased by 60% year-over-year, according to the financial results announced by Alibaba Group Holding Limited (\"Alibaba Group\") for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. This strong performance contributed to a 44% year-over-year growth in Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group's revenue, exceeding market expectations for the sixth consecutive quarter. AliExpress logo (PRNewsfoto/AliExpress)\n\nBringing Shopping to the Next Level\n\nThe catalyst behind this robust growth is AliExpress' Choice, a premium service introduced in March 2023. Designed to redefine cross-border shopping, Choice offers customers exceptional value, a curated selection of high-quality products, logistics and superior customer service at every touchpoint.\n\nThanks to Choice, customers in a growing number of markets now enjoy perks including free shipping, assured on-time delivery and free returns.\u00a0For example, products in the AliExpress Choice section are eligible for free shipping in the majority of applicable markets for purchases worth over US$10 or when any three selected items are bought. As of December 2023, over 20 markets, including Spain and France, enjoy free returns on all Choice products, and 23 markets, including Germany and Switzerland, are offered an on-time delivery guarantee.\n\nLogistics remains a cornerstone of Choice's success, with AliExpress and logistics partner Cainiao extending their global five-day delivery coverage to include 10 markets in the quarter. The volume of orders eligible for this expedited service has seen a triple-digit increase from the previous quarter. In January 2024, nearly half of the AliExpress orders were placed through Choice, underscoring the service's rapidly increasing customer adoption.\n\nFueling Diverse and Dynamic Growth\n\nBeyond logistics enhancements, Choice has broadened AliExpress' product offerings by providing sellers with a one-stop solution that seamlessly integrates sales operations, payment, logistics and warehousing, making it possible for them to concentrate on product innovation and manufacturing. This approach allows sellers to efficiently expand internationally, driving growth for both their own businesses and AliExpress. In anticipation of the Spring Festival, the Cainiao-AliExpress joint warehouse for Choice reported a six-fold growth of stock volume year-over-year, partly fueled by the broadened product selection enabled by the service.\n\nStory continues\n\nGary Topp, AliExpress European Commercial Director, expressed enthusiasm about Choice's impact: \"The introduction of Choice represents a watershed moment for AliExpress. By delivering standout features like complimentary shipping, swift delivery and easy returns, we are cultivating stronger customer loyalty while solidifying our market presence. Looking ahead, we are dedicated to further refining the Choice offering and perpetually elevating the shopper experience.\"\n\nThe introduction of Choice has been pivotal to the growth of AliExpress' global footprint. In Spain, AliExpress claimed the title of the second most-visited e-commerce platform in December 2023, as per Club Ecommerce and EGI Group statistics. In the United States, Similarweb data indicates AliExpress' monthly average visits soared to 24.2 million in 2023 \u2013 a 290% year-on-year spike, marking it as one of the nation's fastest-growing e-commerce sites. Moreover, the number of monthly active AliExpress users in South Korea reached the 7 million mark last November, nearly doubling year-over-year, according to mobile analytics firm WiseApp.\n\nAbout AliExpress\n\nLaunched in 2010, AliExpress is a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce platform enabling global consumers to buy directly from manufacturers and distributors in China and around the world. In addition to the global English-language version, the AliExpress platform is also available in 17 other languages. AliExpress is part of Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group.

        "title": "Alibaba wakes up to competition from PDD and ByteDance, promising to \u2018reignite\u2019 growth as  disappointing results send shares down 6%",
        "content": "China's Alibaba is pledging to inject new energy into its e-commerce department as it tries to hold off new e-commerce entrants like Temu-owner PDD Holdings and TikTok-owner ByteDance. On Wednesday, Alibaba reported underwhelming results for the last quarter of 2023, sending its U.S.-listed shares down by 5.9% despite a $25 billion share buyback program.\n\nRevenue at Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG), the company's core e-commerce group, grew just 2% year-on-year for the final quarter of 2023, reaching 29.07 billion yuan ($17.98 billion). Alibaba's overall quarterly revenue rose by 5% to reach 260.35 billion yuan ($36.61 billion), below analyst estimates.\n\n\"Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our two core businesses: e-commerce and cloud computing,\" Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu told analysts.\n\nWu contineud that Alibaba needed to make targeted investments in \"price competitiveness, service and user experience,\" in a statement published Wednesday. The company will increase the selection of branded and direct-from-manufacturer products on the TTG platform and focus on delivering \"attractive prices for quality products.\"\n\nAlibaba is grappling with a tough market. Chinese consumers are growing more cautious about spending amid macroeconomic headwinds, turning to cheaper products and services.\n\nBut the company is also contending with increased competition from players like PDD Holdings, owner of Pinduoduo and Temu, and ByteDance, parent company of TikTok and its Chinese equivalent Douyin.\n\nPDD Holdings reported 94% year-on-year growth for the quarter ending Sep. 30, 2023. By comparison, Alibaba reported 9% growth in that same quarter. (PDD has yet to report results for the final quarter of 2023).\n\nIn China, Pinduoduo has grown as a community-buying platform that allows consumers to make group orders in bulk to lower costs.\n\nByteDance is also encroaching on Alibaba's turf, particularly by expanding into live-streaming e-commerce. Total sales from live-ecommerce is expected to surpass $800 billion by 2025, according to Insider Intelligence. ByteDance's Douyin app is also expanding to food delivery and leisure travel.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe social media company's full-year revenue surged to $110 billion in 2023, reported Bloomberg, which would move the company closer to Alibaba in total revenue. Alibaba's sales over the 2023 calendar year reached $130.1 billion, according to Fortune calculations. (Alibaba's fiscal year ends in March)\n\nAlibaba reshuffled its senior management team and group businesses late last year to respond to rising competition.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Wu recognized the growing competition in Alibaba's home market, calling China \"the world\u2019s most competitive e-commerce market.\"\n\nA rocky restructuring\n\nOn Wednesday, Alibaba leadership also walked back its ambitious restructuring plans, announced early last year. In March, the e-commerce giant announced plans to transform itself into a holding company and pursue IPOs for its six divisions, like logistics service Cainiao.\n\nBut Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai said that the company is \"not in a hurry\" to proceed with IPOs for Cainiao and its Freshippo grocery chain. \"Market conditions currently are just not in a state where we believe we can really truly reflect the true intrinsic value of these businesses,\" Tsai told analysts.\n\nTsai continued that Alibaba would now seek to sell off some of its non-core assets. \"We have a number of traditional physical retail businesses on our balance sheet, and these are not our core focus,\" he said. \"It makes sense for us to exit these businesses.\"\n\nAlibaba is looking for buyers for its InTime department store chain, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\n\"Alibaba intends to divest its non-core businesses like offline retail and narrow losses for the rest,\" HSBC analysts wrote in a report released Wednesday.\n\nOther parts of Alibaba's restructuring plan have hit roadblocks. In November, the company abandoned plans to spin off its cloud-computing unit, blaming U.S. tech export controls that threaten to cut off the Chinese company's access to advanced chips.\n\nQuarterly revenue from Alibaba's cloud computing division rose 3% year-on-year last quarter to reach 28.06 billion yuan ($3.95 billion).\n\nAlibaba shares continued their decline in Hong Kong. Shares listed in the Chinese city are down 6.8% from the previous day's close, as of 12:00pm Hong Kong time.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Is It Time to Buy the Nasdaq's 5 Worst-Performing Stocks in February 2024?",
        "content": "The stock market is off to a running start in 2024. For instance, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) index has gained 5.9% year to date, led by promising biotechs and giants in the artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nBut some Nasdaq stocks missed the memo about this Wall Street party. Here are the five deepest price dips on the Nasdaq in 2024, drawing a line in the market-cap sand at $500 million:\n\nStock Key Product/Service Market Cap Year-to-date Price Change As Of 2/5/2024 Sigma Lithium(NASDAQ: SGML) Lithium concentrate for electric vehicle batteries $1.58 billion (54%) Hut 8(NASDAQ: HUT) Bitcoin mining $612 million (48%) Gyre Therapeutics(NASDAQ: GYRE) Biotech developing pharmaceutical treatments $1.02 billion (48%) GDS Holdings(NASDAQ: GDS) Data-center operations in China $927 million (45%) Cipher Mining(NASDAQ: CIFR) Bitcoin mining $624 million (41%)\n\nData collected from Finviz.com on Feb. 5, 2024.\n\nWhat happened to these tumbling tech stocks? Are they all down for the count, or should investors see at least some of them as undervalued turnaround plays right now?\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nSigma Lithium: Down 54% in 2024\n\nIf electric cars are the future of transportation, the industry will require massive amounts of pure lithium to build the required battery packs. As such, Brazil-based Sigma Lithium, with one of the world's largest proven lithium reserves, should be poised for incredible business growth in the coming years.\n\nHowever, bulk prices for lithium have plunged 80% lower over the last year, and many market watchers are more worried about oversupply than scarcity at this point. A global surge in lithium production paired with slower electric vehicle sales in the massive Chinese market has tilted the supply-and-demand scales, sending mineral prices to the basement. That's why lithium stocks are plunging as a group, with Sigma Lithium leading the dive.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's good news for battery makers, car builders, and end-market consumers but not so much for material producers such as Sigma Lithium.\n\nThis price drop makes perfect sense, and Sigma Lithium might dive even deeper. I'm not treating Sigma Lithium's dip as a buying opportunity.\n\nHut 8 and Cipher Mining: Down 48% and 41%, respectively\n\nThese crypto-mining specialists are two peas in a pod with nearly identical business models.\n\nHut 8 is a Canadian company with most of its Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) mining operations in Alberta, Ontario, and British Columbia but recently expanding into new facilities in Texas and Nebraska. All four of Cipher's mining facilities are found in Texas. Both can be described as North American Bitcoin miners.\n\nThey also operate on a similar scale with comparable market caps and annual revenues. They are also deeply unprofitable. Cipher holds a cleaner balance sheet with zero long-term debt and $3.3 million of cash equivalents, while Hut 8 has $142 million of debt and only $12.7 million of cash on hand. Still, Hut 8 has a longer history and a larger collection of self-mined Bitcoin tokens.\n\nIt's no surprise to see these risk-laden Bitcoin investments suffer when the leading cryptocurrency inspires bearish headlines. In this case, Bitcoin prices are only down by 2% year to date, but many crypto investors had been hoping for a significant jump if and when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally got around to approving the first Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A rash of 11 new Bitcoin ETFs made their way to the market in mid-January, but Bitcoin prices stayed firm and even dipped modestly. The mining stocks ran out of rocket fuel and reversed their earlier bull runs.\n\nBitcoin miners are always a risky investment, though they also hold great promise in cryptocurrency booms. The upcoming halving of Bitcoin's mining rewards is a double-edged sword for these companies, as the intended increase in crypto prices may not materialize for a year or more, but the power bills supporting a smaller amount of Bitcoin production stay the same.\n\nPlease tread carefully around these tickers while they're down. Hut 8 looks brittle, and Cipher doesn't have much cash. They may have stunning growth potential if they make it to the next bullish Bitcoin peak, but investors could also lose it all if the halving boost takes too long.\n\nGyre Therapeutics: Down 48%\n\nThe company formerly known as Catalyst Biosciences merged with China-based peer Continent Pharmaceuticals in October. The company also executed a 1-for-15 reverse stock split in order to qualify for listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The name change may be meant to distance the reformed business from Catalyst's troubled past.\n\nThe company has a promising pipeline of treatments for issues involving inflammation and organ fibrosis. However, the company isn't reporting stellar progress in its research and regulatory approval efforts, and CEO Charles Wu left the company in December for undisclosed health reasons.\n\nBiotech stocks are inherently risky, and many go bust without hitting a big payday. There are some impressive growth phenoms in this category but many more dead-end research projects with unfortunate investor results. It's too early to tell where Gyre Therapeutics may land in the long run, and I'm more worried than excited about this struggling business until further notice.\n\nGDS Holdings: Down 45%\n\nFinally, GDS Holdings is a China-based business that builds and operates data centers in the Middle Kingdom and around Southeast Asia. It has a 23-year history, a large network of high-performance data centers, and a customer list to die for. GDS' two largest clients are local internet giants Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) and Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEH.Y), together accounting for 45% of the company's net revenue and 52% of its data-center floor space in 2022.\n\nUnfortunately, there's also a serious downside to that highly concentrated client roster. Chinese regulators are imposing heavier restrictions on Tencent's online gambling operations, and the long-running trade tension between Beijing and Washington is limiting Alibaba's cloud computing and AI investments. That's all bad news for GDS Holdings, as its most important clients struggle under heavy-handed government controls.\n\nThis may be the clearest glimmer of light on this list. GDS Holdings used to sport a $21.6 billion market cap three years ago. Its revenue growth has stalled but not reversed, and even a long period of draconian regulations shouldn't keep Tencent or Alibaba down forever. I'm cautiously optimistic about GDS Holdings' prospects of making it through these difficult times and getting back on its feet on the other side.\n\nThat said, there's no telling how long it may take before international tensions ease (if ever) and GDS Holdings' chief clients are allowed to pursue high-octane growth again. Hence, even this thumbs-up rating comes with a bucketful of caveats, and I think you should keep any GDS Holdings investment rather small even at these rock-bottom prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in GDS Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in GDS Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and GDS Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Pre-market futures are up this Hump Day morning, continuing the rebound from Tuesday after a day of selling off (booking profits?) on Monday. While economic prints have cooled from their frenetic pace a week ago, Q4 earnings season roars ahead, even if most of the marquee names in the market have already reported. The Dow is up +73 points at this hour, +15 on the S&P 500 and +80 points on the Nasdaq.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Trade Deficit for December came in roughly in-line with expectations this morning, reaching -$62.2 billion from an improved revision to -$61.9 billion the previous month. While far from ideal, at least we are off the depths from 2023, bottoming out at -$72.9 billion last April, and a record -$102.5 billion reported back in early 2022. Keep in mind, we had run only a limited deficit up until the beginning of this century, at which time it began to sink ever downward.\r\n\r\nAs of the closing bell today, we\u2019ll see another economic report hitting the tape: Consumer Credit, also for the month of December. Expectations are for this metric to cool down to around $15 billion from the big jump the previous month to $23.7 billion. Revolving credit blossomed ahead of holiday season last year, and we know the consumer has thus far spent its way past the dangers of a possible recession. But how much of this spending is going on our credit cards, and how sustainable is this?\r\n\r\nUber UBER reported Q4 earnings ahead of the bell, crushing estimates on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 66 cents per share easily outpaced the 15 cents in the Zacks consensus, though the company did say this was largely due to a $1 billion windfall related to \u201cunrealized gains.\u201d Revenues of $9.94 billion surpassed the $9.75 billion expected, with Mobility up +29% and Delivery +19% year over year. Shares are down almost -2% on the news, however; Uber shares had gained nearly +20% over the past month, so investors are selling on this good news.\r\n\r\nVideo game developer Roblox RBLX surged this morning on a lower-than-expected loss per share in its Q4 report, with negative earnings of -52 cents amounting to a 5-cent beat. Revenues in the quarter grew to $1.13 billion, above the $1.08 billion anticipated, with Daily Active Users (DAU) up +22% year over year. Revenue guidance for the current quarter is also up nicely: to between $910-940 million from the $897 million previously targeted. Shares had gone up +16% on the news, but have since ebbed to +11% at this hour.\r\n\r\nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba BABA shares are down -4% on lower-than-expected revenues reported in the company\u2019s fiscal Q3 ahead of today\u2019s opening bell. The company cites the structural overhaul that has taken lots of company resources over the past year. That said, BABA announced a $25 billion share buyback program, although with this morning\u2019s sell-off, shares are back down to about breakeven from the start of the year.\r\n\r\nAfter today\u2019s close, we\u2019ll see new earnings reports from companies like Disney DIS, PayPal (\u00a0PYPL) and Arm Holdings ARM. For Disney, this morning it has announced a major sports streaming alliance with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery. Disney has long been the parent company for ESPN, but this new platform promises to change the structural burdens and boons of sports broadcasting.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "SINGAPORE (AP) \u2014 Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding on Wednesday approved an additional $25 billion authorization to its share buyback program, amid lower-than-expected sales revenue for the last quarter of 2023.\n\nAlibaba posted a 5% increase in sales to 260.3 billion yuan ($36.67 billion) for its quarter ended December, slightly missing analyst estimates.\n\nNet income sank to 14.4 billion yuan ($2 billion), down 77% compared to the same time last year. The Hangzhou-based firm attributed the drastic drop in net income to the decrease in value of its equity investments and a decrease in income from operations due to that.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s New York-listed stock price fell about 4% in premarket trading following the report.\n\n\u201cOur top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing,\u201d said Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu in a statement.\n\nHe pledged to step up investment to improve user experience and drive growth for its e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, as well as strengthen market leadership.\n\nThe company, once a leader in China\u2019s e-commerce industry, has faced increasing competition from rivals such as Pinduoduo and ByteDance, which operates TikTok and Douyin.\n\nIn an attempt to drive growth, Alibaba in December named current CEO Eddie Wu as the new head of its e-commerce business, replacing longtime Alibaba executive Trudy Dai. The move was made weeks after rival PDD, which operates Pinduoduo, had surpassed Alibaba in market value.\n\nThe company has struggled to recover following a regulatory crackdown on the technology industry and a $2.8 billion fine after authorities deemed that it had violated antitrust regulations.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s revenue growth has slowed even as its e-commerce rivals have gained market share. The firm\u2019s New York-listed stock has plunged nearly 26% over the past year.\n\nAlibaba restructured its businesses in March, splitting them into six units that would eventually raise their own capital and go public.\n\nIts cloud unit had been expected to be among the first to hold an initial public offering, but Alibaba has since scrapped plans to spin-off the business, citing uncertainties over U.S. export curbs on advanced chips used for artificial intelligence.",

        "content": "Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reported earnings on Jan. 30. Although revenue grew by double digits, the stock was down after the report because ad sales growth was slower than analysts' expectations. Google search and YouTube ads revenue had healthy double-digit growth, but the Google Network segment's revenue declined 2% year over year. Combined, Google ad revenue grew 11% year over year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\n\nCompared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet's results were clearly disappointing.\n\nI have followed big U.S. and Chinese technology companies for more than 10 years now. I remember back in 2014, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Alphabet both seemed invincible. But now, both companies are running into trouble. In my opinion, both Alibaba and Alphabet's biggest challenge is culture, which ironically used to be their strength. In the past I've written about Alibaba's cultural crisis. In this discussion, I will focus on Alphabet's culture with discussions of both its pros and cons.\n\nSummary of Alphabet's culture\n\nDuring the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholder meeting, the late Charlie Munger commented on Alphabet's culture. He said, \"I've been to Google headquarters. It looked to me like a kindergarten.\" Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) added, \"A very rich kindergarten.\"\n\nI agree with Munger and Buffett's observations about Google because I have also been to its headquarters a few times. Personally I wouldn't use the word kindergarten to describe it, but the atmosphere is certainly very laid-back with plenty of on-site facilities. This atmosphere was designed from day one to help facilitate creativity, as laid out by Google's very first founders' letter, which states the following:\n\nGoogle is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. Throughout Google's evolution as a privately held company, we have managed Google differently. We have also emphasized an atmosphere of creativity and challenge, which has helped us provide unbiased, accurate and free access to information for those who rely on us around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving the best talent is key to Alphabet's business model. To attract the best talent, the company created the unconventional decentralized atmosphere and offered the highest compensation package in the industry. As a result, it has always had a very high win-rate when recruiting talent. Once the best engineers join the company, they have maximum amount of flexibility and enjoy tremendous benefits such as a free gym, snacks, diverse on-site restaurants and much more. In other words, everything is taken care of by Alphabet. This is probably why Munger and Buffett call it a kindergarten.\n\nThis culture worked very well in the early years. I remember during my first visit to Google campus in 2014, I was really impressed by the open and vibrant culture. For a long time, this was key to Alphabet's moat.\n\nThe main issues with Alphabet's culture\n\nLike all other big tech companies, Alphabet grew its employee base rapidly over the past decade as its business continued to expand. In 2014, the company had only 53,600 employees. By the end of 2022, the number of employees had ballooned to 190,234. Inevitably, more employees means more bureaucracy. This is true for all big tech companies. The company realized it had too many employees so, for the first time in its history, it implemented layoffs, which decreased the employee count to 182,381 as of the latest quarter.\n\nBut bureaucracy is not Alphabet's main cultural issue. I think the biggest issue with its culture is complacency and sloth, which ironically is the accumulated result of the decentralized and creative culture it is proud of. It is analogous to spoiling your children. The best way to destroy a talented child is to spoil him or her with easy-to-get luxuries. For many years, Alphabet's engineers have been used to this hands-off and laid-back approach of management. This approach works as long as the business is booming. But once the competition picks up, Alphabet's culture can be detrimental. It is like going to war with an army of soldiers who are rusty at essential military skills.\n\nAnother issue with the company's culture is its lack of flexibility in terms of product design and development, which resulted in less user-friendly products. The best example is the cloud business. Alphabet developed the cloud technology years before Amazon. But Alphabet's product is not user-friendly at all because its engineers are not used to listening to customer feedback. Therefore, Alphabet's cloud business has grown much slower than Amazon and Microsoft. I'm concerned the company will repeat this problem again with Bard, which is its version of a conversational artificial intelligence tool.\n\nLast but not least, I think Alphabet is facing a problem of cultural division. This was inevitable as the company grew its employee base. To be fair, most big tech companies will face this problem. But with Alphabet, the issue is particularly severe because it is more open than the other tech companies. Therefore, there are fewer rules governing employee behaviors, which makes it harder for management to reconcile differences.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet's earnings release is disappointing, but not too bad. For long-term investors, the more concerning issue is its culture. Unless management takes dramatic action, the cultural issues are here to stay. Fortunately, Sundar Pichai has realized the culture issues and has taken steps to address them. It remains to be seen whether he can successfully tackle them in the future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

The company\u2019s pace of eliminating roles has been fairly steady, as it reduced headcount by roughly the same number over the course of 2022 as well.\n\nMirroring US peers like Meta Platforms Inc., Alibaba paired the reduction in staff with a significant buyback, extending its authorization for repurchases by another $25 billion on Wednesday. The company bought back $9.5 billion worth of shares in 2023.\n\nFor Alibaba, once China\u2019s most valuable company, the large staff has had to support a sprawling network of e-commerce, cloud, logistics and related services. But in recent times it has sought to offload peripheral holdings and prepare its main business units to break off into separate entities.

Net income in the period fell sharply to 14.4 billion yuan.\n\nAlibaba gained more than 5% in pre-market trading in New York after the company said its board had approved the new share buybacks. That helped salve concerns about the performance of the online shopping pioneer \u2014 a barometer of Chinese consumer demand, \u2014 struggling to fend off new rivals from PDD to ByteDance Ltd. The disappointing sales cast more uncertainty on a restructuring that will split the conglomerate into several parts including cloud and logistics, an overhaul designed to revive growth at a national icon.\n\nAlibaba is trying to stage a comeback from years of brutal government punishment and strategic missteps that cost the e-commerce operator its place as leader of the country\u2019s tech industry. Co-founder Jack Ma in November urged the company to correct its course.\n\nClick here for a liveblog of the numbers and conference call.\n\nChief Executive Officer Eddie Wu and Chairman Joseph Tsai, two of Ma\u2019s longest-standing confidantes, took the helm as former chief Daniel Zhang abruptly quit, and are now charged with effecting the complicated multi-way split. The ultimate goal is to beat back upstarts like ByteDance\u2019s Douyin and PDD, while charting a new course for Alibaba to become a major player in artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat entails streamlining and big moves. Wu is promoting a younger cohort of executives to revive its core Taobao and Tmall platforms, while exploring ways to unload non-core assets and dial back Zhang\u2019s years-long \u201cnew retail\u201d ambition. At the same time, Alibaba must find an answer to Douyin, which has won shoppers over and grew sales faster during last year\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival.\n\nCompetition \u201cis likely to continue to center on building market share at low prices,\u201d Kenneth Fong, head of China internet research at UBS, said before the results. \u201cEven if macroeconomic recovery occurs, price wars between platforms are likely to continue.\u201d\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nThe gains from TTG and Cainiao likely helped reduce the drag on Alibaba\u2019s overall profitability from steeper year-over-year international digital commerce loss in 3Q as the firm spent more to acquire more overseas shoppers, particularly on AliExpress.\n\n- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nAlibaba is also keen to shore up its foothold in overseas markets. Units such as Lazada and Aliexpress underpin the global e-commerce operation, now among its fastest-growing divisions despite up-and-comers such as PDD\u2019s Temu and Shein.\n\nAs with most major tech firms, Alibaba counts AI among its longer-term priorities. It\u2019s developing its own ChatGPT-like services, while making multiple investments in startups such as Zhipu AI and Baichuan.\n\nThat AI effort has stuttered initially. Last year, Alibaba nixed the spinoff and IPO of its $11 billion cloud arm, surprising investors while citing US curbs that cut off access to Nvidia Corp.\u2019s essential AI accelerator chips. It\u2019s unclear what steps executives plan to take to rejuvenate a business that once counted among its growth engines, but has lost market share to state-owned players in recent years.\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov, Sarah Zheng, Debby Wu and Peter Elstrom.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "content": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Alibaba Group Holding on Wednesday missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue, hurt by softness in the retail market and sagging economic recovery in the world's second-largest. The company's U.S.-listed shares, which announced an increase of $25 billion to its share repurchase program through the end of March 2027, were up 3.5% in premarket trading.\n\nAlibaba announced the split of its business into six units last March in a transition overseen by CEO Eddie Wu and Chairman Joe Tsai, both Alibaba co-founders.\n\nWu, Group CEO since September, has been consolidating his control over Alibaba's core businesses and has told staff the company's strategic focuses would be \"user first\" and \"AI-driven\" as it combats slower earnings growth.\n\nHowever, the e-commerce giant is under pressure from a slow recovery in China's online shopping market after the country lifted its pandemic curbs a little more than 12 months ago. Consumers in the world's second-largest economy have been cutting costs in response to a stuttering post-COVID recovery, boosting low-cost domestic e-commerce players such as PDD Holdings, which owns Pinduoduo and overseas-focused platform Temu, and prompting Alibaba to increase its focus on discounting and lower-priced goods.\n\nLast year, Alibaba scrapped plans to spin off its cloud business, citing uncertainties over U.S. curbs on exports to China of chips used in artificial intelligence applications.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba's logistics division, Cainiao, has applied to list in Hong Kong, and just last week, sources told Reuters Alibaba was looking to sell a number of consumer sector assets, including its grocery business Freshippo, retailer RT-Mart and shopping mall operator Intime. The company reported revenue of 260.35 billion yuan ($36.19 billion) for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 262.28 billion yuan expected by 19 analysts polled by LSEG.\n\n($1 = 7.1941 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Varghese, Savyata Mishra and Casey Hall; Editing by Himani Sarkar ad Sriraj Kalluvila)",

        "content": "By Casey Hall and Harshita Mary Varghese\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Alibaba Group Holding on Wednesday missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue, hurt by softness in the retail market and sagging economic recovery in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Alibaba rose 1.3% in pre-market trading after the company flagged an increase of $25 billion to its share repurchase program through the end of March 2027.\n\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders was 14.4 billion yuan ($2 billion) and net income was 10.7 billion yuan ($1.51 billion), a decrease of 77%.\n\nAlibaba announced the split of its business into six units last March in a transition overseen by CEO Eddie Wu and Chairman Joe Tsai, both Alibaba co-founders.\n\nThe company said in December that Wu, group CEO since September, would directly oversee its domestic e-commerce arm, increasing his focus on the core divisions of the company as it combats slower earnings growth and rising competition.\n\n\"Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing,\" Wu said on Wednesday.\n\nTaobao and Tmall Group revenue grow only 2% for the quarter, which includes year-end sales festivals such as Singles Day that have traditionally driven growth.\n\nExecutives on a post-earnings call said early evidence of a recovery in Taobao and Tmall Group's gross merchandise volume or GMV was more recently becoming apparent.\n\n\"Our strategy is focused on increasing purchasing frequency, if we do that we will achieve better GMV growth,\" Wu said.\n\nAlibaba is under pressure as consumers in China, the world's second-largest economy, have been cutting costs in response to a stuttering post-COVID recovery, boosting low-cost domestic e-commerce players such as PDD Holdings.\n\nPDD, which owns Pinduoduo and overseas-focused platform Temu, soared past Alibaba on Dec. 1 to become the most valuable Chinese e-commerce company after Morgan Stanley downgraded Alibaba on concerns over slower turnaround in its cloud business and customer management revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba scrapped plans to spin off its cloud business last year, citing uncertainties over U.S. curbs on exports to China of chips used in artificial intelligence applications, in a big blow to its market value at the time. Last week, sources told Reuters that Alibaba was looking to sell a number of consumer sector assets, including its grocery business Freshippo, which has been locked in a price war with Walmart's membership chain Sam's Club, leading both sides to cut prices on popular items.\n\nA Freshippo spokesperson had denied the reports of a potential sale.\n\nAlibaba's International Digital Commerce segment, which operates various retail and wholesale marketplaces including AliExpress and Alibaba.com., performed strongly, with AliExpress orders rising 60% on the year.\n\n\"There is huge potential for AIDC (Alibaba International Digital Commerce) to increase penetration in many markets,\" said AIDC's chief executive Jiang Fan on a call with analysts following the quarterly earnings release.\n\n($1 = 7.1941 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Varghese, Savyata Mishra and Casey Hall; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Sriraj Kalluvila, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Louise Heavens)",

        "title": "Alibaba Group Announces December Quarter 2023 Results",
        "content": "HANGZHOU, China, February 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988 (HKD Counter) and 89988 (RMB Counter), \"Alibaba\" or \"Alibaba Group\") today announced its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\"We delivered a solid quarter as we are executing our focused strategies across the organization. Our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing. We will step up investment to improve users\u2019 core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen market leadership in the coming year. We will also focus our resources on developing public cloud products and sustaining the strong growth momentum in international commerce business,\" said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\n\n\"Alibaba Group delivered a healthy quarter with revenue growth of 5% year-over-year. We increased our investment in strategic priorities and improved shareholder return by leveraging our strong balance sheet\u00a0and cash flow. Our board of directors approved an increase of US$25 billion to our share repurchase program, demonstrating our confidence in the outlook of our business and cash flow. Our consistent share repurchase has also reduced outstanding share count while achieving EPS and cash flow per share accretion,\" said Toby Xu, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba Group.\n\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2023:\n\nRevenue was RMB260,348 million (US$36,669 million), an increase of 5% year-over-year.\n\nIncome from operations was RMB22,511 million (US$3,171 million), a decrease of 36% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to impairment of intangible assets of Sun Art and impairment of goodwill of Youku. Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP measurement (excluding share-based compensation expense, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and certain other items), increased 2% year-over-year to RMB52,843 million (US$7,443 million).\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB14,433 million (US$2,033 million). Net income was RMB10,717 million (US$1,509 million), a decrease of 77% or RMB35,029 million year-over-year, primarily attributable to mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and the decrease in income from operations due to the impairment as mentioned above. Excluding share-based compensation expense, gains/losses of investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB47,951 million (US$6,754 million), a decrease of 4% compared to RMB49,932 million in the same quarter of 2022.\n\nDiluted earnings per ADS was RMB5.65 (US$0.80) and diluted earnings per share was RMB0.71 (US$0.10 or HK$0.78). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB18.97 (US$2.67), a decrease of 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was RMB2.37 (US$0.33 or HK$2.62), a decrease of 2% year-over-year.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was RMB64,716 million (US$9,115 million), a decrease of 26% compared to RMB87,370 million in the same quarter of 2022. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, was RMB56,540 million (US$7,963 million), a decrease of 31% compared to RMB81,514 million in the same quarter of 2022. The decrease in free cash flow was attributed to increased capex and several one-time factors including timing of income tax payments and working capital changes related to several of our businesses.\n\nBUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES\n\nTaobao and Tmall Group\n\nWe are in the process of revitalizing Taobao and Tmall Group and positioning it for future growth. Our growth strategy is to put users first, build ecosystem for brands and merchants to thrive on our platform, and realize technology-driven innovation. We are committed to building an e-commerce ecosystem where brands, merchants and manufacturers operate with high efficiency, thereby providing multi-tiered Chinese consumers with good products and services at attractive prices. In December 2023, we appointed a new management team to execute Taobao and Tmall Group\u2019s strategy and drive business growth through technological innovation.\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Taobao and Tmall Group was RMB129,070 million (US$18,179 million), a growth of 2% year-over-year. During the quarter, online GMV achieved healthy growth year-over-year, with the number of transacting buyers and order volume growing strongly, partly offset by decrease in average order value. Under our user engagement and price-competitive strategies, we continued to increase interactive content and broaden the assortment of value-for-money products. Additionally, we continued our efforts to onboard a wider range of brands and merchants. The number of merchants operating on our platform during the quarter continued to grow at double digits year-over-year, and this double-digit growth trend has sustained over the past four quarters.\n\nFollowing a successful 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, order volume grew double digits year-over-year during the second half of the quarter. This reflected increasing consumer demand and willingness to make purchases on our platform driven by our price-competitive strategy.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been successful in retaining and growing premium shoppers as the number of 88VIP members continued to increase double digits year-over-year, surpassing 32 million.\n\nCloud Intelligence Group\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Cloud Intelligence Group was RMB28,066 million (US$3,953 million), a growth of 3% year-over-year. We continue to improve revenue quality by reducing the revenue from low-margin project-based contracts. On the other hand, revenue from public cloud products and services grew healthily which contributed to profitability improvement.\n\nRecent highlights of our proprietary products and technology include:\n\nElastic Compute: In January 2024, Alibaba Cloud unveiled its newest general-purpose ECS instance g8i, which significantly boosts overall performance and AI inferencing capabilities.\n\nDatabase: In the 2023 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Cloud Database Management Systems report, Alibaba Cloud was named a Leader for the fourth year in a row.\n\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (\"AIDC\")\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from AIDC grew 44% year-over-year to RMB28,516 million (US$4,016 million), and the combined orders of AIDC grew 24% year-over-year. The strong performance was driven by solid growth across all of AIDC\u2019s retail platforms, especially from the cross-border AliExpress Choice business. Our cross-border businesses exhibited rapid year-over-year growth in response to increasing global demand for high-quality products at attractive prices. To sustain this momentum and provide differentiated services to customers, we increased investments during this quarter and will continue to invest in further growth.\n\nDuring the quarter, AliExpress delivered over 60% year-over-year order growth, driven by Choice, which provides an enhanced experience to consumers by combining better product selection, price and quality with speed of logistics and great customer support. Choice represented about half of AliExpress\u2019 total orders in January 2024 and continues to deliver rapid order growth.\n\nDuring the quarter, Trendyol continued its robust double-digit order growth. While maintaining its leading e-commerce position in T\u00fcrkiye, Trendyol has further extended its operations into the Middle East with a wide range of merchandise as well as speedy and reliable logistics experience.\n\nLazada continues to focus on optimizing its operating efficiency. With further increased monetization and decreased logistics costs, Lazada\u2019s loss per order continued to narrow year-over-year during the quarter.\n\nCainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited (\"Cainiao\")\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Cainiao grew 24% year-over-year to RMB28,476 million (US$4,011 million), primarily driven by revenue from cross-border fulfillment solutions.\n\nCainiao continues to execute its strategy of building a global smart logistics network, reinforcing comprehensive end-to-end capabilities in first-mile pick-up, line haul, customs clearance, sortation, and last-mile delivery. To support cross-border business development, with the upgrade of end-to-end capabilities, Cainiao further expanded its premium 5-day delivery service coverage, adding two more countries during the quarter. The order volume for the premium 5-day delivery service achieved robust triple-digit quarter-over-quarter growth.\n\nLocal Services Group\n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue from Local Services Group grew 13% year-over-year to RMB15,160 million (US$2,135 million), driven by healthy growth of Ele.me and rapid growth of Amap. During this quarter, order growth of Local Services Group exceeded 20% year-over-year. Local Services Group\u2019s annual active consumers reached over 390 million and their annual purchasing frequency grew strongly year-over-year for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. For this quarter, its losses continued to narrow driven by improving business scale and efficiency.\n\nDigital Media and Entertainment Group\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, revenue of Digital Media and Entertainment Group was RMB5,040 million (US$710 million), an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by strong revenue growth of offline entertainment businesses of Alibaba Pictures. During the quarter, Damai, a subsidiary of Alibaba Pictures, consolidated its industry-leading position by servicing almost all the major concerts in China, which contributed to rapid GMV growth year-over-year. Total box office of movies produced, promoted and distributed by Alibaba Pictures\u2019 movie segment accounted for more than half of China\u2019s total box office during the quarter.\n\nUpdates on ESG Initiatives\n\nProgress in Decarbonization\n\nWe continue to accelerate our transition to clean energy. In November 2023, Bloomberg New Energy Finance released the \"China's Top Clean Energy Buyers and Sellers in 2023.\" Alibaba Group, with a green electricity transaction volume of 1,610 gigawatt-hours, became the national leader for green electricity procurement for the first time.\n\nIn November 2023, Alibaba Group was the first Asian Internet technology company to join the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a group of over 200 businesses, to support WBCSD\u2019s drive to make global value chains more sustainable. At COP28, Alibaba Group together with WBCSD and other corporate members, advocated for \"Scope 3+\" carbon reduction actions by promoting the \"Guidance on Avoided Emissions\" report.\n\nUpsize of Share Repurchase Program\n\nAs previously announced, during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 292.7 million ordinary shares (equivalent of 36.6 million ADSs) for a total of US$2.9 billion, and a total of 897.9 million ordinary shares (equivalent of 112.2 million ADSs) for a total of US$9.5 billion during the 2023 calendar year. As of December 31, 2023, we had 20.0 billion ordinary shares (equivalent of 2.5 billion ADSs) outstanding. Our share repurchase program resulted in a net reduction of 3.3% in our outstanding shares in the 2023 calendar year after accounting for shares issued under our ESOP.\n\nOur board of directors has approved an increase of US$25 billion to our share repurchase program through the end of March 2027. Following this upsize, we currently have US$35.3 billion available under our share repurchase program through the next three fiscal years. We have undertaken to update investors on our share repurchases immediately after the end of each quarter with the next update expected to be published in early April.\n\nDECEMBER QUARTER SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Three months ended December 31, 2022 2023 RMB RMB US$ YoY %\r\nChange (in millions, except percentages and per share amounts) Revenue 247,756 260,348 36,669 5% Income from operations 35,031 22,511 3,171 (36)%(2) Operating margin 14% 9% Adjusted EBITDA(1) 59,162 59,572 8,391 1%(3) Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) 24% 23% Adjusted EBITA(1) 52,048 52,843 7,443 2%(3) Adjusted EBITA margin(1) 21% 20% Net income 45,746 10,717 1,509 (77)%(4) Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders 46,815 14,433 2,033 (69)%(4) Non-GAAP net income(1) 49,932 47,951 6,754 (4)%(4) Diluted earnings per share(5) 2.24 0.71 0.10 (68)%(4)(6) Diluted earnings per ADS(5) 17.91 5.65 0.80 (68)%(4)(6) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(1)(5) 2.41 2.37 0.33 (2)%(4)(6) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS(1)(5) 19.26 18.97 2.67 (2)%(4)(6)\n\n____________________ (1) See the sections entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures\" for more information about the non-GAAP measures referred to within this results announcement.

However, revenue from our public cloud products and services experienced healthy year-over-year growth.\n\n(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA\n\nCloud Intelligence Group adjusted EBITA increased by 86% to RMB2,364 million (US$333 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to RMB1,269 million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily due to improving product mix through our focus on public cloud and operating efficiency.\n\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group\n\n(i) Segment revenue\n\nInternational Commerce Retail Business Revenue from our International commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB23,260 million (US$3,276 million), an increase of 56% compared to RMB14,954 million in the same quarter of 2022.

Losses increased year-over-year primarily due to the increased losses of Youku.\n\nAll Others\n\n(i) Segment revenue\n\nRevenue from All others segment was RMB47,023 million (US$6,623 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 7% compared to RMB50,334 million in the same quarter of 2022, mainly due to the decrease in revenue from Sun Art, driven by the scale down of supply chain business and the decrease in ticket size.\n\n(ii) Segment adjusted EBITA\n\nAdjusted EBITA from All others segment in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was a loss of RMB3,172 million (US$447 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,698 million in the same quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in year-over-year loss from Sun Art due to scale down of certain of its businesses.\n\nDECEMBER QUARTER OTHER FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nCosts and Expenses\n\nThe following tables set forth a breakdown of our costs and expenses, share-based compensation expense, and costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expense by function for the periods indicated:\n\nThree months ended December 31, % of Revenue YoY change 2022 2023 RMB % of Revenue RMB US$ % of Revenue (in millions, except percentages) Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue 150,005 61% 156,214 22,002 60% (1)% Product development expenses 13,521 6% 13,488 1,900 5% (1)% Sales and marketing expenses 30,628 12% 33,783 4,758 13% 1% General and administrative expenses 10,327 4% 11,261 1,586 4% 0% Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 5,530 2% 14,601 2,056 6% 4% Impairment of goodwill 2,714 1% 8,490 1,196 3% 2% Total costs and expenses 212,725 86% 237,837 33,498 91% 5% Share-based compensation expense: Cost of revenue 1,660 1% 1,184 167 0% (1)% Product development expenses 3,755 2% 2,822 397 1% (1)% Sales and marketing expenses 1,081 0% 805 113 0% 0% General and administrative expenses 2,277 1% 1,411 199 1% 0% Total share-based compensation expense 8,773 4% 6,222 876 2% (2)% Costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expense: Cost of revenue 148,345 60% 155,030 21,835 60% 0% Product development expenses 9,766 4% 10,666 1,503 4% 0% Sales and marketing expenses 29,547 12% 32,978 4,645 13% 1% General and administrative expenses 8,050 3% 9,850 1,387 3% 0% Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 5,530 2% 14,601 2,056 6% 4% Impairment of goodwill 2,714 1% 8,490 1,196 3% 2% Total costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expense 203,952 82% 231,615 32,622 89% 7%\n\nCost of revenue \u2013 Cost of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was RMB156,214 million (US$22,002 million), or 60% of revenue, compared to RMB150,005 million, or 61% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2022.

All information provided in this results announcement is as of the date of this results announcement and are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date, and Alibaba does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA (including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures\" in this results announcement.\n\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income in order to provide more information and greater transparency to investors about our operating results.\n\nWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, and operating lease cost relating to land use rights, impairment of goodwill, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business, as well as equity-settled donation expense), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.\n\nAdjusted EBITA represents net income before interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business, as well as equity-settled donation expense), which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.\n\nNon-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, impairment of goodwill and investments, and others (including provision in relation to matters outside the ordinary course of business, as well as equity-settled donation expense), and adjustments for the tax effects.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjusting for the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.\n\nFree cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses) and intangible assets (excluding those acquired through acquisitions), as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the buyer protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces. We deduct certain items of cash flows from investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating business operations. We exclude \"acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses\" because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude buyer protection fund deposits from merchants on our marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of compensating buyers for claims against merchants.\n\nThe table captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures\" in this results announcement has more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\n\nALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS Three months

Following this increase, the e-commerce company will have US$35.3 billion available under the scheme through the next three financial years.\n\nAlibaba's shares are down about 27 per cent in the past 12 months amid a broad pullback for China technology stocks.\n\nAlibaba chief executive Eddie Wu Yongming said in a statement that the company's performance last quarter was \"solid\" and that \"our top priority is to reignite the growth of our core businesses, e-commerce and cloud computing\".\n\nAlibaba shares closed down 1.45 per cent at HK$74.90 on Wednesday in Hong Kong, ahead of the quarterly earnings release.\n\nAlibaba said the year-on-year profit drop was primarily due to losses from its equity investments and the impairment of intangible assets at hypermarket Sun Art and impairment of goodwill at its video platform Youku.\n\nUnder non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Alibaba's net income dropped 4 per cent year-on-year to 47.95 billion yuan in the December quarter.\n\nFor the quarter, its core e-commerce unit Taobao and Tmall Group achieved revenue of 129.07 billion yuan, growth of 2 per cent year-on-year. Online gross merchandise volume achieved healthy growth year-on-year, with the number of transacting buyers and order volume growing strongly, partly offset by a decrease in average order value, according to Alibaba's statement.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I am convinced that if Taobao adheres to its positioning ... and provides a shopping experience of great goods, good prices, and good services for different consumer groups, it will definitely gain the trust of users and return to a growth track,\" said Wu on an earnings call with analysts.\n\nRevenue from the Cloud Intelligence Group was 28.06 billion yuan, up 3 per cent year-on-year. Alibaba said it is continuing to improve revenue quality by reducing sales from low-margin project-based contracts.\n\nRevenue from the Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group grew 44 per cent year-on-year to 28.5 billion yuan in the quarter, driven by solid growth across all of the unit's retail platforms, especially from the cross-border AliExpress Choice business, according to the statement.\n\nAlibaba is still in the midst of a sweeping restructuring to break its business empire into six major units and several small businesses, as it battles increased competition from the likes of PDD Holdings, which operates Pinduoduo in China and Temu overseas.\n\nIt has faced some setbacks, putting on hold its listing plan for supermarket chain Freshippo as the company evaluates \"market conditions\" and terminating the US$12 billion planned initial public offering (IPO) of its cloud business.\n\nHowever, it is still pushing ahead with the planned listing of its logistics unit Cainiao on the Hong Kong stock exchange, expected later this year.\n\nJoe Tsai, Alibaba co-founder and chairman, said on the earnings call that current market conditions were to blame for the postponed IPOs, saying that business value is not being correctly reflected at the present time.\n\n\"We believe prioritising the creation of synergies within Alibaba to strengthen our core business, is the best value maximisation path today,\" said Tsai.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The head of ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s China operations is stepping down, a week after Chief Executive Officer Liang Rubo said the company needed to avoid complacency and make up lost ground in the AI race.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court Xi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets Build Wall Street Snubs China for India in a Historic Markets Shift \u2018Money Dysmorphia\u2019 Traps Millennials and Gen Zers King Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health Scare\n\nKelly Zhang is relinquishing the post of Douyin Group CEO, a ByteDance spokesperson said on Wednesday, confirming an earlier report in Chinese media. She took on the role in 2020, sharing responsibilities with ByteDance China Chairman Zhang Lidong. ByteDance will not seek to appoint a successor and Kelly Zhang will shift her focus to the video-editing app CapCut, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as the plans are private.\n\nBeijing-based ByteDance, the owner of short-video platforms TikTok and Douyin, needs to adopt a sense of crisis and steer clear of mediocrity, Liang told staff in a companywide meeting at the end of January. He said he saw several organizational problems that needed to be addressed and lamented ByteDance falling behind in the artificial intelligence race kickstarted by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cAI technology will greatly disrupt content creation and even lead to new creative tools. We hope to actively explore, fully understand and seize the opportunities,\u201d Liang wrote in a memo to staff announcing Kelly Zhang\u2019s move, reviewed by Bloomberg. He attributed the decision mainly to business development needs and said Han Shangyou, who previously reported to Kelly Zhang, will continue running day-to-day operations at Douyin and report to Zhang Lidong.\n\nRead More: ByteDance CEO Warns Staff Against Mediocrity After Slow AI Start\n\nKelly Zhang joined ByteDance in 2014 and was one of the few prominent women in leadership posts among China\u2019s biggest tech firms. In her position, she oversaw ByteDance\u2019s products and operations domestically, including Douyin and news aggregator Toutiao. Outside of China, the TikTok business is headed up by Singaporean Shou Chew, who was one of the social media CEOs grilled by US senators last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nKelly Zhang\u2019s exit leaves some uncertainty at the top of a platform she helped build into an e-commerce and content force. Douyin started out as a repository for short videos but rapidly grew into an online shopping and social media leader, creating the template for ByteDance\u2019s TikTok Shop overseas. The service is now challenging Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s WeChat for advertising, forcing the larger company to refocus on its own video initiatives, and eroding Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s market share in online shopping.\n\n\u201cKelly Zhang\u2019s performance at Douyin speaks for itself and has led to impressive achievements, so this is definitely not a question of her ability,\u201d said Li Chengdong, head of Beijing-based think tank Haitun. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be much impact as their business has already become institutionalized. Douyin is already an industry leader.\u201d\n\nLong hailed as the world\u2019s most valuable startup, ByteDance now rivals Chinese internet pioneers like Tencent, with sales surpassing $110 billion last year. TikTok is also the first non-gaming app to bring in more than $10 billion in user spending over its lifetime.\n\n\u201cI am excited to work together with the team members at CapCut to create our own dreams, and to grow in this AI era to draw a fantasy world together,\u201d Zhang wrote in a social media post. \u201cI will continue to use this entrepreneurial mindset to work hard for the next 10 years at the things I am passionate about.\u201d\n\n(Updates with CEO letter to staff and further details on ByteDance plans)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "content": "China will welcome the Year of the Wood Dragon, symbolizing growth and progress. To shift from stock market losses, the People\u2019s Bank of China announced a larger-than-expected cut in banks\u2019 required reserve ratio to boost sentiment around the New Year\u2019s holiday. Thus, perhaps this time of prosperity has already begun, leading some Chinese investors to pile back into the market. Also, some Chinese stocks are about to hit a major boom.\n\nInvestors are clearly hoping for for a prosperous \u201cgreen dragon\u201d in 2024. Despite numerous macro challenges, China aims for a 5% growth target. The country hopes to achieve this by implementing effective stimulus measures amid market uncertainties.\n\nWith more money being pumped into the Chinese market than we\u2019ve seen in a while, here are three stocks investors may want to consider this Chinese New Year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown by 40% in 2023 compared to its American competitors, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has undoubtedly had a rough go of it in recent years. Although regulatory concerns remain, new catalysts have risen that signal potential growth for the company in 2024.\n\nOne of Alibaba\u2019s early believers was SoftBank, and it was only in 2021 that this company announced it would be selling most of its stake in the Chinese tech giant. This lack of confidence in the company has contributed to the stock\u2019s continued decline, leading to a lack of interest in Alibaba relative to higher-growth peers.\n\nThat said, Alibaba\u2019s new CEO Eddie Wu plans to revitalize earnings and growth catalysts. While the company has been shaken a bit due to recent insider buying, there are reasons for optimism for the stock. Previous chair Jack Ma, and current chair Joe Tsai bought a big stake in Alibaba in Q4. The company is also experimenting with selling its InTime store arm in the market.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s future relies on its robust position in China\u2019s fast-evolving cloud computing sector. As of first quarter of 2023, Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the Chinese cloud market, with solid growth predicted in the Chinese public cloud sector. Moreover, with AI integration driving its growth, the company\u2019s pricing power and high renewal rates puts Alibaba in a good position for continued upside in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nLabeled as China\u2019s Google, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has made some intriguing moves in the generative AI sector. The company has made a brilliant ecosystem shift through its foundation models. Cohesive with API, Baidu\u2019s ERNIE can support AI-native applications for businesses of all sizes, encouraging collaborative ecosystem development. More than 10,000 companies and businesses have adopted a monthly subscription to ERNIE since its regulatory approval. With the capacity to handle millions of daily queries, ERNIE offers seamless AI-integrated applications that go well into other Baidu products.\n\nAdditionally, ERNIE\u2019s chatbot now unifies Samsung\u2019s latest model, the Samsung Galaxy S24. The collaboration between Baidu and Samsung has sprung real-time transition features and advanced AI capabilities, ready to compete with Apple\u2019s latest iPhone models.\n\nAside from the AI integrations, Baidu also reported strong financials, with operating income growth of more than 20% year-over-year, a 5% increase in total revenue, and another 6% growth in non-online marketing earnings. Its ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, also reported positive numbers, seeing a rise of more than 73% rise in its total rides. Although the company experienced a 22% decline in 2023, Baidu is well-positioned to rebound because of its AI commitments.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a well-known Chinese tech giant, touted for its excellent strategies that involve long-term stable investments. The company focuses on two key areas: creating a unique platform ecosystem, and accelerating an everyday low prices (EDLP) model. Therefore, the company aims to enhance business efficiency while meeting diverse consumer demands. JD has long focused on balancing the needs of affordability and quality fit for its customers.\n\nThe company also prioritizes user satisfaction through enhanced customer service. Such innovations include instant refunds and best-price guarantees. Its excellent Q3 order frequency reports show that the strategy is very effective and has successfully increased engagement.\n\nJD.com also provides a competitive platform for both first-party and third-party sellers. The scoring system for third-party merchants was recently improved, resulting in improving sentiment and outcome expectations from experts such as continuous double-digit growth in the company\u2019s third-party advertising segment. These efforts position JD stock well for continued valuation growth over the long-term. This is easily one of the top Chinese stocks that you should consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Why Alibaba, PDD Holdings, and JD.com Were All Moving Higher Today",
        "content": "Chinese stocks were surging broadly today on signs that Beijing was taking steps to support the stock market following a brutal decline over the last three years.\n\nThis morning, reports that China's sovereign wealth fund would pump cash into the stock market had investors feeling suddenly bullish about Chinese stocks. China's own stock market indexes surged with the Shanghai Composite up 3.2%, and the tech-heavy Shenzhen Component Index rose 6.2%. The Hong Kong-based Hang Seng, meanwhile, rose 4%.\n\nNaturally, U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks were among the winners, including Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD). As of 11:37 a.m. ET, those stocks were up 4%, 4.3%, and 7%, respectively. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChinese stocks finally get a break\n\nChina stocks have been suffering for years as a crackdown on the tech sector by Beijing, the COVID-19 pandemic, and a weak economic recovery after the pandemic have all contributed to a long slide in Chinese stocks. Foreign investors, meanwhile, seem to have moved on from China as many of the sector stocks are trading at dirt cheap valuations.\n\nAlibaba was the poster child for China's crackdown on the sector after founder Jack Ma made insulting remarks about Chinese finance officials. That led to the initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group, Alibaba's financial arm, being blocked, a multibillion-dollar fine, and sluggish revenue growth due to weak economic growth and intensifying competition. Alibaba's most recent quarterly earnings report revealed a new challenge. The company said it was abandoning a plan to spin off its cloud computing business because of the U.S. CHIPS Act, which restricts U.S. semiconductor technology from being sent to China. That could also weigh on companies like Alibaba.\n\nPDD Holdings, which owns Pinduoduo and Temu, has been a rare winner in the Chinese tech sector. Pinduoduo's social commerce model has also helped drive strong growth, taking market share from Alibaba and JD.com, and forcing increased price competition. Meanwhile, Temu, PDD's international e-commerce site known for rock-bottom prices and widespread marketing, has seen blistering growth as well, challenging Shein for supremacy among Chinese international e-commerce sites. Revenue jumped 94% in its most recent quarter, a sharp contrast to Alibaba and JD. Still, PDD is reliant on the Chinese economy and consumer spending so it's not surprising that it's moving on today's news or general economic data.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD.com is the worst-performing of these three Chinese tech stocks, and it's also the slowest growing. In its third quarter, the company's revenue grew by just 1.7%. JD has arguably been the biggest loser due to competition from Pinduoduo, TikTok parent ByteDance, and others. Of the three stocks above, JD has the least international exposure, making it the most sensitive to the Chinese economy, JD is also mostly focused on low-margin products like electronics, appliances, and general merchandise like groceries. While the company has seen some decent growth in its logistics segment, the challenges it's faced in its retail business indicate it doesn't have a competitive advantage, especially as it loses market share to Pinduoduo. In December, founder Richard Liu urged employees to be more competitive and fight back against Pinduoduo.\n\nCan Chinese stocks keep gaining?\n\nTwo days of gains do not constitute a pattern, but plenty of investors are looking for a bottom in Chinese stocks after so much pain over the last three years. Alibaba and JD.com trade at price-to-earnings ratios around 10, but that valuation isn't meaningful if investors are unwilling to invest in China, and their growth rates remain mired in the single digits.\n\nInvestors should learn more when Alibaba delivers its quarterly earnings report tomorrow, the first of these three tech companies to do so.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PDD Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PDD Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PDD Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "An Attempt to Value Alibaba",
        "content": "In the recent past, I've written quite a bit on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA). Most of the discussions relate to qualitative factors of the business. However, one question I get asked frequently is how to value the stock.\n\nMany readers find that it is very hard to value Alibaba because of its complexity and the risks related to investing in Chinese equities. In this discussion, I will attempt to provide a framework of my approach to value the stock given what I know about the business. It is worth mentioning that I also acknowledge that Alibaba's valuation is as much art as it is science. Therefore, please take my valuation with a grain of salt.\n\nDCF versus the value investing approach\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nFirst of all, I would not use discounted cash flow to value Alibaba even though it is the standard method of valuation. The reason why I do not recommend using DCF to value Alibaba is based on Bruce Greenwald's observation:\n\nThe DCF/CAPM methodology that business schools teach is a theoretically elegant formulation. But in practice, the margin of error makes it worthless for investing. These models depend not only on near-term cash flows, which can be projected reliably, but also on long-term cash flows and terminal values, which cannot. Terminal values rely on highly subjective assumptions of costs of capital and growth rates. Any error, however slight, in these variables can dramatically throw off valuations. Furthermore, DCF models ignore balance sheets, throwing away some of the most tangible, reliable and therefore valuable information available.\n\nInstead, he recommended the following approach:\n\nThe value investing approach organizes information by the reliability of assumptions, starting with the balance sheet. Within the balance sheet, reliability decreases from cash to accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment to intangibles like customer acquisition, branding and advertising costs.Value investors use estimates of sustainable, steady-state earnings levels, based on current earnings and cash flows, to value a company's earnings power. This analysis yields three possible scenarios: a company's earnings-power value is lower than its asset value, its earnings-power and asset values are about equal or its earnings-power value is greater than its asset value. The value investing approach looking first at asset value, then earnings-power value, then competitive advantage and managerial ability and then growth is in every way more accurate than the DCF method.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the reasons listed above, I shall use the value investing approach to value Alibaba.\n\nAssets value\n\nBelow is a snapshot of Alibaba's assets from the most recent earnings release: An Attempt to Value Alibaba\n\nAs of Sept. 30, Alibaba has cash and cash equivalents of $74 billion, equity securities and other investments of $34 billion and investments in equity method investees of $28.50 billion. For conservative purposes, I will take a 20% haircut to both equity securities and other investments and investment in equity method investees. The result is roughly $125 billion in cash and quasi-cash assets. As of Sept. 30, Alibaba had $1.10 billion in short-term bank loans, $7.50 billion in non-current bank loans and $14.20 billion in unsecured senior notes. Combined, Alibaba has total interesting-bearing debt of $22.80 billion. Deducting this from $125 billion in cash and quasi-cash assets, we arrive at Alibaba's net cash position of $102 billion.\n\nEarnings power and growth value\n\nAlibaba's pre-tax income and net income for 2020 to 2023 has been volatile due to large one-off items, but its operating income has been quite stable. Therefore, we will use the company's operating income as a proxy for its earnings power. Over the three-year period, Alibaba's operating income oscillated between $13 billion and $15 billion with an average of about $14 billion. For conservative purposes, we will use the low end of $13 billion as Alibaba's sustainable steady-state pre-tax earnings power. We then apply an 18% tax rate to arrive at after-tax steady-state earnings power of $10.70 billion. Obviously the value of this earnings power depends on the discount rate. For illustration purposes, we will use a 15% discount rate here. The result is total earnings power value of roughly $71.30 billion. If you think Chinese ADRs have higher risks, then you can use a higher discount rate.\n\nAlthough Alibaba has had some growth over the past few quarters, I would not bet on its future growth given the structural issues. Therefore, here I will assign no growth value for the stock for conservative purposes.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the above calculation, we can arrive at Alibaba's steady-state valuation of roughly $173 billion (net cash $102 billion and $71 billion of earnings power value assuming a 15% discount rate). This is not far from today's market value of $181 billion. Clearly the market is also currencly assigning no value for Alibaba's growth. If the company can growth its earnings power, then the stock is undervalued. If Alibaba's earnings power declines in the future, then the stock might be a value trap.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "In this article, we will look into the top 20 most innovative economies in Asia. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the Top 5 Most Innovative Economies in Asia.\n\nTechnological Advancement in Asia\n\nAccording to the IMF, Asia emerged as a leader in applied research, accounting for a patent share of 54% in 2019. This can be attributed to major economies in the region including China, Japan, and Korea, placing Asia ahead of Europe and America in terms of patent production. Moreover, frontier Asian economies such as South Korea, invest heavily in research and development. Singapore and New Zealand lead the basic science patent output in Asia and the Pacific. On the other hand, non-frontier economies have capitalized on high-tech imports, foreign investment, and participation in the global value chain. Additionally, the rise in tertiary education enrollment rates in countries such as India and Vietnam is providing the necessary skills to their workforce to adapt and innovate.\n\nNon-frontier economies in Asia have also evolved their digital infrastructure. For instance, the number of secure internet servers has amplified 200 times, resulting in a reduced gap compared to high-income countries. India has emerged as a leader in information technology. Many economies including China, Japan, and South Korea are working at the forefront of digital technology adoption including robotics and e-commerce. China is the world's biggest user of robots, accounting for around 30% of the market.\n\nDespite its innovation and impressive achievements in research and development, the region still faces multiple challenges to fully capitalize on its innovative potential. Technology adoption and scientific developments are restricted within a cluster of few firms and countries, while other economies lag. The uneven distribution limits regional productivity in Asia. Moreover, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the region face multiple challenges such as little to no access to cutting-edge technologies and a lack of capabilities to utilize them, especially in the digital domain. This restricted access inhibits the growth of SMEs in Asia. Asian economies must tackle these challenges to foster sustained and inclusive growth, benefitting the region as a whole.\n\nStory continues\n\nMajor Players in the Asian Market\n\nSome of the key players driving innovation in the region include Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX). On January 30, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) announced its new serverless solution and a vector engine technology at the AI and Big Data Summit in Singapore. The new solution enables users to access as many computer resources as they need. It allows users to only pay for what resources they use, bringing the inference costs 50% down. Vector engine technology transforms text and data into an HD space. The space allows the embedding of structured and unstructured contexts to facilitate tasks. At the summit, Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (NYSE:BABA) Cloud launched a new tool, PAI-Artlab for designers. This will help them simplify the process of model training and image generation. On January 23, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) reported that it had signed a three-year sponsorship agreement with World Athletics. This agreement will leverage Sony Group Corporation's (NYSE:SONY) technological capabilities at all World Athletics Series events from 2024 to 2026. This also includes the upcoming championships in Glasgow and Tokyo in 2025. The company will utilize its expertise to record and share the excitement of these events around the world, with the help of the Alpha mirrorless camera and top-notch broadcast solutions. Moreover, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), Hawk-Eye Innovations will be ensuring fair competition through its officiating services. POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX) is a leading integrated steel manufacturing company in South Korea. On February 2, the company announced that it had taken a major step toward hydrogen reduction steelmaking. The company launched a new development center, focusing on HyREX technology. It is a process that utilizes hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. This will help POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX) reduce its carbon emissions. The center will have different teams for research, construction, and testing, aiming for the completion of the 300,000-ton test facility by 2027. Now, let's have a look at the top 20 most innovative economies in Asia. Top 20 Most Innovative Economies in Asia\n\nTop 20 Most Innovative Economies in Asia\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the top 20 most innovative economies in Asia, we employed metrics including\u00a0R&D Expenditure, High Technology Exports in US$, and Digital Adoption Index (DAI).\n\nFirstly, we sorted countries based on their R&D expenditure. We then sourced their DAI and high-technology exports from the World Bank. We assigned ranks to the countries on our list based on each metric. Finally, we allotted weights as 40% to R&D Expenditure, 40% to High Technology Exports, and 20% to DAI to our metrics. Our list ranks the countries in descending order of the weighted average calculated across our metrics.\n\nPlease note that we have not included Israel in our list due to the current geopolitical situation in the country. The war on Gaza by Israel has led to major economic losses in the country, making it difficult to assess its innovation.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

BP reported a sharp drop in profits after oil prices fell last year but is pushing ahead with further shareholder returns.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Still Historically Cheap",
        "content": "One of the few guarantees Wall Street offers is that there's always going to be a next-big-thing investment trend to captivate investors' attention. At the moment, no trend is garnering more hoopla than artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhen I say \"artificial intelligence,\" I'm talking about the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically overseen by humans. The not-so-secret sauce to AI is the incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to learn/evolve and become more efficient at their tasks over time.\n\nAccording to researchers at PwC, AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- and there's no way investors are going to overlook figures this large. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget about Nvidia. There are considerably better values among AI stocks\n\nWhile there are dozens of technology-driven companies that have embraced AI with open arms, the poster child of the AI revolution is semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the infrastructure backbone of high-compute data centers. In other words, they're the brains that allow for the split-second decision-making required of AI-driven systems.\n\nAlthough Nvidia is expected to have more than doubled its sales in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ended in late January) on the heels of exceptionally strong data-center revenue, it's also a company that's seemingly priced for perfection in an imperfect industry with numerous unknowns.\n\nAs I've previously pointed out, Nvidia's biggest enemy looks to be itself in calendar year 2024. Whereas A100 and H100 GPU scarcity led to phenomenal pricing power that fueled almost the entirety of its data-center revenue growth through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, an increase in the company's GPU production in the current fiscal year could sap its pricing power and hamper its gross margin.\n\nSomething else to consider is that Nvidia isn't going to be the only GPU player in AI-accelerated data centers. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to ramp up production in 2024. Likewise, Intel unveiled its generative AI Gaudi3 chip as a direct competitor to the H100 in December, with plans to launch sometime this year. Nvidia's monopoly like market share in high-compute data centers is liable to fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo make matters worse, U.S. regulators have, on two separate occasions, restricted exports of Nvidia's high-powered AI chips to China. Not being able to export AI-focused chips to the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product could cost Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nWith Nvidia set to face a number of challenges, its estimated price-to-cash-flow ratio of 61 in fiscal 2024 is exceptionally pricey. The good news is there are two other AI stocks that are still historically cheap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first historically inexpensive artificial intelligence stock that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Even after gaining more in market cap in a single day ($197 billion) than any other stock in history -- a feat accomplished on Feb. 2, 2024 -- Meta is still exceptionally cheap.\n\nThe company behind the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet is utilizing AI in a variety of ways. Meta AI offers a virtual chatbot that can entertain and educate people, while more than a dozen generative AI solutions are being tested to tailor advertisements and improve search functions, among other tasks.\n\nMeta also has its augmented and virtual reality segment known as Reality Labs. Even though Reality Labs is losing copious amounts of money at the moment, it could evolve into a key on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of the decade.\n\nFor now, Meta's social media sites are its bread and butter. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded apps globally, and they were collectively responsible (as part of Meta's \"family of Apps\") for attracting nearly 4 billion monthly active users during the fourth quarter. Businesses are well aware that their best chance to target broad audiences online is through advertisements with Meta. This is where generative AI could be especially useful.\n\nMeta also closed out 2023 with $47 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated almost $46.8 billion in income from operations (even with Reality Labs weighing on its operations) for the year. With a clearly dominant foundational segment (social media), Meta has demonstrated that it can afford to take risks.\n\nDespite catapulting to an all-time closing high on Feb. 2, shares of Meta can be scooped up for 13 times forward-year cash flow. That's 17% below Meta's average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the previous five years.\n\nFurthermore, Meta shares are valued at 21 times forward-year earnings, which is more or less in-line with the benchmark S&P 500. But when factoring in Wall Street's expected annualized earnings growth of 32% for Meta over the next five years, we're left with a minuscule price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 0.7.\n\nAlibaba\n\nThe other unbelievably cheap AI stock that'll have you completely forgetting about Nvidia is China's leading e-commerce company, Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nThough Alibaba's e-commerce segment has long been its foundation: Taobao and Tmall account for almost 51% of China's online retail sales, according to the International Trade Administration. The company's future could rest on considerably higher-margin cloud services. As of March 31, 2023, Alibaba Cloud had gobbled up 34% of cloud-infrastructure service share in mainland China.\n\nThe most exciting application of AI for Alibaba is its large language model (LLM) known as Tongyi Qianwen. It's effectively Alibaba's own version of ChatGPT, the AI chatbot that ignited the AI craze a little more than a year ago.\n\nIn addition to traditional question-and-answer functionality like ChatGPT, Tongyi Qianwen's most important task might just be generative AI solutions within Alibaba's market-leading cloud. Generative AI could be tasked with improving search quality and comparisons, as well as tailoring marketing to individual consumer needs.\n\nAlibaba should also benefit in the years to come from a rebounding Chinese economy whose supply chains were crippled by lockdowns for multiple years during the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady rebound in consumer- and enterprise-purchasing activity, coupled with China's expanding middle class, increases the likelihood of sustained growth for Alibaba's leading e-commerce marketplace and cloud-service platform.\n\nAlibaba closed out September with north of $85 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash, and equity securities. If its net cash is backed out of the equation, shares of the company are valued at just 5 times forward-year earnings. That's the cheapest shares of Alibaba have ever been as a public company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors looking for an end to the freefall in shares of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. may be in for a long wait, if options traders are correct.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKing Charles Treated for Cancer in New Health Scare for Monarchy Why NYC Apartment Buildings Are on Sale Now for 50% Off China Tightens Some Trading Restrictions for Domestic and Offshore Investors Eastern Europe\u2019s Richest Woman Pivots $43 Billion Empire West Bonds Fall After \u2018One-Two Punch\u2019 of ISM, Fedspeak: Markets Wrap\n\nThe stock\u2019s nearly 80% tumble from a 2020 record high has driven its valuation to an all-time low and put its market capitalization on a par with upstart rival PDD Holdings Inc. The derivatives market indicates further pain, with the options skew showing increased bearishness ahead of Alibaba\u2019s earnings report due Wednesday. A put contract betting the stock will drop 14% by the end of April was the most traded on Monday in Hong Kong.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s revenue for the three months through December is expected to have risen 5.6% from a year ago, the slowest growth in three quarters amid difficult economic conditions and steep discounting. Forward earnings estimates for the company have fallen about 4% over the past month.\n\nChina\u2019s online retail market has grown crowded, with stalwarts Alibaba and JD.com Inc. facing new entrants including Douyin Mall, run by TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. At the same time, persistent deflationary pressure and declining wages have driven a price war that is being won by discounters like Pinduoduo, the local equivalent of PDD\u2019s Temu.\n\n\u201cThe focus is whether Alibaba can survive the macro weakness,\u201d said Tam Tsz-Wang, analyst at DBS Vickers Hong Kong Ltd. \u201cThe market is expecting it to lose market share as they face fierce competition from rivals like Douyin and PDD. Another focus would be whether they are able to import new drivers to maintain their overall growth.\u201d\n\nThe stock is trading at 8 times forward earnings, near its lowest valuation ever and making it one of the cheapest technology stocks in China. In comparison, Hong Kong-listed utility CLP Holdings Ltd. is trading at around 13 times expected earnings, as is the Hang Seng Tech Index.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba spent $9.5 billion on share buybacks last year, a record high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and says it still has about $12 billion remaining through 2025 to spend on repurchases. The firm may spend half of its free cash flow on buybacks and could also announce special dividends after business divestments, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Ronald Keung. He maintains a buy rating on Alibaba, citing its attractive valuation.\n\nOptions traders are less sanguine, with the trading volume of put options spiking in recent days. These include a contract betting the stock will drop more than 3% before the end of April. The market is pricing in a 5.6% share move in either direction in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s results, which would be one of the biggest post-earnings moves for the stock in two years.\n\nRevamp efforts led by the company\u2019s new management include scaling down non-core business while stepping up investment in global expansion and artificial intelligence. It\u2019s focusing on improving core operations, including moving resources from its Tmall site to Taobao in order to better meet demand for cheaper products, though it may take time to see results.\n\nThis focus on lower prices will lead to weaker revenue growth, which \u201cis certainly negative to near-term sentiment and share price,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Alex Yao, who cut his estimate for Alibaba\u2019s profit for the current year by 3% last month. The company\u2019s core business growth will likely \u201cremain lackluster in the next four quarters.\u201d\n\n(Updates as of Tuesday morning trading)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Bloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders  Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Mano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a Am\u00e9rica Latina Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

This was kind of a strange reaction to news that, this morning, analysts at Loop Capital lowered their price target on the stock from $115 to $111 per share.\n\nBut here's a bit of information that might help to explain the stock's price move for you: Loop still thinks Alibaba stock is a buy.\n\nWhat Loop Capital said about Alibaba\n\nLoop made its Alibaba comments in the context of what The Fly called \"a broader research note on China Internet.\" Overall, the bank noted that China is suffering from \"weak\" consumer confidence and \"soft\" hiring that are making growth \"challenging\" -- even for internet stocks that are supposed to be in perpetual growth mode.\n\nAnd yet China remains the world's biggest market for internet services of the kind Alibaba supplies. Despite all the headwinds Alibaba (and others) are facing, Loop can't help but think that investors are assigning \"overly punitive\" valuations to Chinese internet stocks, and that these valuations are just bound to rise again if given enough time.\n\nIs Alibaba stock a buy?\n\nPersonally, I'm no huge fan of China's government -- and I'm downright paranoid about the effects of recent government regulations on Chinese stocks. That being said, Loop is actually probably right about this. While Alibaba may not be growing as fast as it once was, consensus forecasts have the company still growing earnings at greater than 12% annually over the next five years.\n\nFor a company that's selling for barely 10x trailing earnings -- and paying a tidy 1.4% dividend yield -- that makes for a very attractive valuation. The valuation looks even better when you realize that Alibaba has nearly $80 million in cash on its balance sheet (against less than $28 billion in debt), such that nearly $0.30 out of every $1 of the company's market capitalization is already backed up by net cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen you consider further that Alibaba is generating $24.5 billion in positive free cash flow -- enough cash to grow its bank account by nearly 50% by the end of this year -- it's hard to argue that Alibaba stock's valuation is anything but \"cheap.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Twist my arm, and I might be convinced to buy this particular Chinese stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company 01.AI, backed by the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), is positioning itself to be a leader in the AI space under the leadership of prominent venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee, the mastermind behind establishing Google and Microsoft Corp. in China.\n\n01.AI is challenging the norms with its open-source model Yi and has rapidly climbed the ranks on the Hugging Face leaderboard, showcasing the power of its large language models (LLMs).\n\nIt recently received $200 million in funding from Alibaba Cloud and Lee's venture firm Sinovation Ventures and soared to a valuation of $1 billion within just eight months.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCheddar was acquired for $200 million yielding a return of 370.37% for its investors. This startup aims to replicate and potentially surpass this success. This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\n\n01.AI\u2019s Yi-34B, with its superior performance and cost-effectiveness, is positioned as a crucial player in addressing market demand for large-scale language models, especially in China where OpenAI and Google are restricted.\n\n\"Yi-34B outperforms much larger models like LLAMA2-70B and Falcon-180B. Also, Yi-34B's size can support applications cost-effectively, thereby enabling developers to build fantastic projects,\" according to 01.AI's website.\n\nTrending: Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\n\nLee\u2019s advocacy for open-source extends beyond 01.AI, as seen in his recent post on X.\n\n\"An issue with one or a few companies having all the most power and dominating the models is that it creates tremendous inequality,\" he wrote. He highlights the potential adverse effects on researchers, students, entrepreneurs and hobbyists, stressing the role of open source in fostering innovation.\n\nOn the contrary, the pioneer in leading the American AI initiative, Microsoft-backed OpenAI, initially aimed to position itself as an open-source model, but later shifted to a closed-source strategy with a focus on profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nClosed-source models may hinder collaboration, limit the scrutiny of AI systems and contribute to the concentration of power in the hands of a few organizations.\n\n\"China's not ahead of the U.S. in LLM, but there's no doubt China can build better applications than American developers mostly because of the phenomenal mobile internet ecosystem that was built over the last 12 years or so,\" according to Lee.\n\nBut America still has time to keep its dominance in the space.\n\nAs the global competition in the AI domain intensifies, the collaborative open-source efforts of leading American AI companies \u2014 such as OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc., Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Anthropic PBC \u2014 could demonstrate a shared commitment to maintaining American leadership. This collaborative approach aims to strike a delicate balance between openness and safeguarding sensitive information, recognizing that not all situations warrant complete transparency.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhat decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nDingTalk on visionOS also supports Persona, a Vision Pro feature that lets users create realistic avatars of themselves by scanning their faces, to be used in video calls.

The platform recently added an artificial intelligence (AI) agent function that aims to help users customise their workflow, as other Chinese Big Tech firms also rush to integrate AI functions into new and existing products.\n\nDingTalk's mixed-reality app will face competition from a flurry of productivity apps available on the Apple headset. The US tech giant said last week that more than one million apps will eventually be compatible with the Vision Pro, 600 of them built specifically to take advantage of the device's unique spatial experience.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Could This Low-Performing Stock Make You a Millionaire?",
        "content": "JD.com(NASDAQ: JD) continues to grapple with its share of geopolitical and economic challenges as a prominent player in China's robust e-commerce market, and its share price has dropped by 60% in the last twelve months. But if you're wondering whether JD.com could rebound, transform its fortunes, and someday deliver big gains from here to savvy investors, the place to start is with a measured look at its recent performance and the nuances of its markets.\n\nMarket dominance and competitive edge\n\nJD.com holds a commanding 26% share of China's e-commerce gross merchandise volume, according to Statista, positioning it as a rising competitor to industry leader Alibaba(NYSE: BABA). Its strategic investments in digital and logistics infrastructure align with the digital economy's continued growth. Such a significant market presence, bolstered by its position as an intermediary between businesses and buyers, fortifies the company's competitive edge.\n\nJD.com's stellar market position rests against the backdrop of fierce competition in the e-commerce sector. Significant market share in a growth-prone segment suggests strong potential for capital appreciation. JD.com must still innovate continually to maintain its market stronghold and grow. Its strategy to integrate advanced digital infrastructure into its business model both cements its position in the e-commerce market and provides a scalable platform for future growth. This approach may help disrupt traditional market dynamics, offering JD.com an edge in capturing new market segments.\n\nFinancial strength and stability\n\nJD.com's stable revenue growth and operational income indicate it possesses a sturdy foundation. Its most recent quarterly earnings report demonstrated resilience amid market volatility, with net revenues reaching $34 billion, up 1.7% year over year. This growth, albeit modest, confirms a steady market presence. Operational income rose to $1.3 billion from the prior-year period's $1.2 billion, showcasing effective cost management strategies. Financial stability is crucial in the fluctuating e-commerce market, potentially heralding sustainable growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's ability to effectively manage costs and optimize its operations could signal its readiness to capitalize on new business opportunities, thus ensuring sustained growth in the long term. However, such a modest revenue increase also indicates that investor confidence -- and its stock price -- may grow slowly instead of skyrocketing, a major point in weighing JD.com's value as a long-term investment.\n\nThe Chinese calculation\n\nThe digital economy significantly contributes to China's GDP, with the portion of its retail sales conducted online surpassing the global average. This robust e-commerce environment is a promising sign for companies like JD.com. With nearly 850 million digital buyers, according to Statista, China's market offers immense growth opportunities for JD.com. The e-commerce company's alignment with China's burgeoning digital economy positions it to tap into the expanding pool of digital consumers. This alignment could be key in capturing emerging market trends and meeting the evolving needs of China's vast consumer base.\r\n\r\nHowever, geopolitical concerns ensured a rough year for Chinese markets in 2023, contributing heavily to JD.com's share price drop over the last year. The Chinese government continues to consider stimulus measurements amid these economic woes, which could bode well for beaten-down investor confidence. Further government intervention could either bolster or erode JD.com's efforts in the near future, and courts recently sided with JD.com in an anti-monopoly case against industry-leading Alibaba. Continual development also favors e-commerce, as Statista projects that the Chinese e-commerce market will grow at a compound annual rate close to 10% over the next five years, resulting in a projected market volume of over $2.1 trillion.\n\nDividends\n\nJD.com's dividend yield of 2.6% and its forward annual dividend payout of $0.62 per share indicate its ability to generate steady income for investors, a factor particularly appealing for those focused on income generation through their investments. Its payout ratio of 28.33% signifies JD.com's balance in allocating profits; it returns a significant portion to shareholders while retaining sufficient funds to reinvest in the business for future growth.\n\nThis approach suggests a strategic focus on both shareholder value and the long-term expansion of the company. This blend of stability in income with potential for growth makes JD.com a more attractive option for those seeking a mix of income and capital appreciation.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nJD.com's low rate of revenue growth indicates a slower pace in market expansion recently, especially when contrasted with Alibaba's dominance. With a profit margin of 2.2% and an operating margin of 3.8%, it has a long way to go to match Alibaba's margins of 14.5% and 14.9%, respectively. Profit and operating margins demonstrate efficacy and the ability to transform revenues into value for the company.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic and highly competitive nature of China's e-commerce sector demands constant innovation and strategic agility. JD.com's future growth hinges on its ability to navigate these market intricacies and sustain its expansion momentum. To surmount these challenges, JD.com must capitalize on supply chain management and customer service. Efficiency improvements and cost reductions in its supply chain can bolster profitability. Exploring new market segments could further counteract its slower revenue growth and help build market position.\n\nEyes on the prize\n\nJD.com's path to creating millionaires through investment is laden with challenges, yet the company's financial stability, market strength, and shareholder value focus present it as a highly viable candidate for long-term investment. While immediate returns might not be soaring, JD.com's gradual growth trajectory could significantly contribute to wealth accumulation over time.\n\nThe best way to shoot for millions remains to adopt a diversified portfolio approach and hold for long-term growth as your investments accumulate wealth gradually. JD.com could very well represent a strong choice for such a portfolio in the years to come, though one that comes with the caveat of navigating tricky international waters.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and JD.com wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 58% of His Portfolio Invested in These 7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "David Tepper's Carolina Panthers didn't make the NFL playoffs this year. However, Tepper has other things to make him feel better.\n\nFor example, his net worth currently stands at a whopping $20.6 billion. He's also viewed by many as the greatest hedge fund manager of the last four decades.\n\nTech stocks have been key to Tepper's success in the past, and that isn't likely to change going forward. The multibillionaire currently has nearly 58% of his Appaloosa Management hedge fund invested in just seven artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nTepper's favorite AI stocks\n\nBelow are the top seven AI stocks in Tepper's Appaloosa portfolio, as of the hedge fund's latest 13F-HR filing on Nov. 14, 2023:\n\nStock Shares Owned Percent of Portfolio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.95 million 11.56% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 1.64 million 10.19% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 3.75 million 9.41% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.02 million 8.80% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) 2.75 million 7.16% Alibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA) 3.6 million 6.16% Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) 2.27 million 4.62% Total 57.9%\n\nData source: Appaloosa 13F-HR filing.\n\nFive of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Alphabet -- rank as Tepper's largest holdings. The only members of the group that he doesn't own are Apple and Tesla.\n\nWhy these seven AI stocks?\n\nWe know one thing for sure: Tepper didn't buy these stocks just because of the recent generative AI buzz. For example, he's owned Meta stock since 2014 (back when it was still known as Facebook). His Appaloosa hedge fund initiated a position in Alphabet the following year.\n\nPerhaps the simplest reason why Tepper is invested so heavily in these seven stocks is that he likes their growth prospects. AI certainly plays a key role in the future growth for all of the companies.\n\nMeta is charting a different course than the others by open sourcing much of its AI efforts. CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that this approach will pay off over the long run. He noted in the company's third-quarter earnings conference call that open sourcing \"increases adoption and creates a standard around the industry.\" Zuckerberg thinks that Meta ultimately will benefit from this.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Alibaba all operate cloud platforms. They will experience significant growth as companies shift their IT spending to the cloud, in large part to build AI apps.\n\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are the AI equivalents of the picks-and-shovels merchants during the gold rush days. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are currently the gold standard for powering AI apps, and AMD is fighting for market share in the AI chip space, as well. Meta and Microsoft announced in December that they plan to use AMD's newest AI chips, signaling that there's a big opportunity for alternatives to Nvidia.\n\nAre Tepper's top AI stocks good picks for other investors?\n\nWall Street is only enthusiastic about one of Tepper's top AI stocks over the next 12 months: The average price target for Alibaba reflects an upside potential of more than 60%. Analysts don't expect much from the other stocks -- at least over the near term.\n\nI think, though, that all seven of these AI stocks could be big winners for long-term investors. Alibaba is the most attractively valued of the group. However, it also could be more volatile due to the sluggish growth of the Chinese economy.\n\nAI won't be the only growth driver for these stocks. Meta and Alphabet could enjoy solid growth in advertising revenue from their online platforms. Microsoft is a huge player in multiple markets, including productivity software and gaming.\n\nAmazon and Alibaba are e-commerce giants. Nvidia and AMD market their chips for purposes not related to AI.\n\nI predict, however, that AI will be the biggest tailwind for all of these stocks and help increase Tepper's net worth to a lot more than $20.6 billion within a few years. I suspect that investors who aren't multibillionaires could make plenty of money with Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet, Alibaba, and AMD, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alibaba (BABA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlibaba is expected to post earnings of $2.73 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.86 points to a change of +11.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.57 indicates a change of -3.2% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $132.6 billion and $142.76 billion estimates indicate +5.2% and +7.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlibaba reported revenues of $30.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.8%. EPS of $2.14 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.64%. The EPS surprise was +1.42%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In the wake of a rebounding economy and falling inflation rates, e-commerce stocks are poised to take center stage in 2024. The recent surge in sales during the holiday season hints at a power-packed fourth quarter performance for online retailers, laying a promising foundation for the forthcoming year. The upward trajectory in consumer spending and economic recovery underscores a bullish outlook for e-commerce stocks in 2024. Moreover, the digital marketplace continues to thrive post-pandemic, and the trend should continue to escalate as each new consumer generation navigates the digital shopping sphere. Savvy investors should seize the moment to wager on the top e-commerce stocks in anticipation of robust gains in a landscape where digital storefronts continue to dominate the retail horizon.\n\nE-Commerce Stocks 2024: Shopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify\u2019s (NYSE:SHOP) stock trajectory has been nothing short of a rollercoaster, with an impressive rebound nearly doubling its value over the past year following a major plunge in 2022. Moreover, its financials have followed suit with another strong showing in the third quarter, beating expectations across both lines for the fifth consecutive quarter. With a striking sales growth of 25.5%, amounting to $1.71 billion, and net income soaring to $718 million, Shopify didn\u2019t just meet industry forecasts; it soared past them, surpassing estimates by comfortable margins.\n\nLooking ahead, the horizon for Shopify appears even more promising. Buoyed by the firm\u2019s stellar performance, analysts have revised their projections 30 times for the fourth quarter, anticipating an incredible sales leap to $2.07 billion. As we step into 2024, Shopify is poised to demonstrate unwavering strength. If the firm can maintain its momentum in surpassing earnings expectations, the potential for significant upside is undeniable, making Shopify a standout in its niche.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStory continues\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPositioned at the epicenter of the industrial real estate landscape, Prologis (NYSE:PLD) stands as a true titan, with multiple tailwinds igniting its prospects. A seismic shift in the financial terrain is anticipated, with private equity real estate investments poised to rise significantly due to the forecasted drop in interest rates.\n\nDespite issuing modest 2024 earnings guidance amidst market challenges, Prologis is set to outshine expectations. Analysts predict an incredible 25% hike in fiscal 2025 funds from operations to $6.23, significantly surpassing its 5-year historical CAGR of 13.1%. Additionally, its financial positioning is outstanding, evidenced by a noteworthy increase in free cash flow per share from $5.25 last year to $6.04 on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nEchoing this optimism, Tiprank\u2019s assigns Prologis a \u2018strong buy\u2019 rating, hinting at a minimum 12% ascent from its current stance, positioning it as a beacon in the real estate forecast for the current year.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has emerged as a prudent investment choice, effectively blending its traditional retail dominance with an aggressive digital expansion. The retail giant\u2019s post-pandemic transformation, marked by an array of third-party sellers and an optimized logistics network, efficiently yields tangible results. Additionally, Walmart\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2024 report continues to shine, revealing an amazing 15% surge in global e-commerce sales to a staggering $24 billion. This isn\u2019t mere market maintenance; it\u2019s a strategic evolution, positioning the company on a trajectory of continued growth and innovation.\n\nReflecting on Walmart\u2019s digital journey, a notable insight from Oberlo underscores the magnitude of its e-commerce ascension. From 2019 to 2023, the retailer\u2019s online sales skyrocketed, more than tripling while charting an impressive average annual growth rate of 36.6%. This remarkable progress cements Walmart\u2019s status as a retail juggernaut and a dynamic, forward-looking contender.\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) The Jumia logo on a laptop.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nJumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) acclaimedasthe \u201cAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa,\u201dis poised for a robust showing in 2024, targeting a largely untapped market of 1.4 billion in burgeoning regions. Unlike its colossal counterpart Amazon, Jumia\u2019s regional focus gives it a sizable edge. Having navigated through the pandemic-led headwinds and post-pandemic slowdown, Jumia has emerged resilient, streamlining operations, enhancing liquidity, and expanding its delivery network.\n\nThe company\u2019s journey toward profitability is gaining momentum, as shown by its most recent earnings report, which showcases the narrowest loss since its market debut five years ago. As a pioneer on the African continent, Jumia represents a singular small-cap investment, capturing international markets with its distinctive presence. Moreover, trading at an attractive 1.7 times book value and with forward revenue projections indicating a shift from a negative to a positive growth rate, Jumia is shaping up as a compelling investment in its niche.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) has weathered a significant storm, with its valuation experiencing more than a 50% descent in the past five years amidst a broader downturn for Chinese tech stocks. Yet, the tide appears to be turning, fueled by a robust $278 billion market support initiative from Beijing.\n\nLikewise, the firm\u2019s resilience is further evidenced by a notable 9% surge in its top line, reaching a massive $30.8 billion year-over-year (YOY). A standout performance from Alibaba International, marked by a remarkable 53% revenue bump and a major reduction in EBITA losses, speaks volumes about the firm\u2019s market prowess and operational agility. Strategic partnerships, like that with Cainiao, have revolutionized logistics, ensuring swifter deliveries. Meanwhile, introducing the \u2018Choice\u2019 service on AliExpress, guaranteeing free shipping and returns, has significantly improved the consumer experience. Moreover, the platform\u2019s soaring order volumes across key regions accentuate Alibaba\u2019s dominant market stance, especially in emerging markets.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) stands out in the e-commerce landscape, with its powerful global payment network serving as the backbone of secure and rapid online transactions. Its commitment to technological innovation and its universal acceptance render it a leading player in digital commerce, fueling consistent sales expansion. Additionally, amidst macroeconomic fluctuations, Visa\u2019s resilience is noteworthy, consistently delivering robust growth in both revenue and earnings.\n\nThe company\u2019s transaction prowess is evident, with volumes rising from $2.995 trillion to $3.824 trillion over three years, marking an impressive 27.7 % increase. The third quarter alone saw revenues jump to a whopping $8.1 billion, a 12% YOY increase, and a 9% rise in payment volumes. As the world gravitates towards digital solutions, the uptrend in card usage positions Visa to reap substantial benefits. Adding to its appeal, Visa boasts a commendable record of dividend growth, stretching across 15 consecutive years, with an annual payout of $2.08.\n\nPDD (PDD) A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD (NASDAQ:PDD) stands out in the e-commerce realm, with its platforms Pinduoduo and Temu, captivating a global audience across more than 40 countries. Moreover, the allure of low-cost yet quality offerings has skyrocketed Temu\u2019s popularity, amassing over 100 million users drawn to its deep discounts and varied product range. This strategic expansion has bolstered PDD\u2019s presence in the e-commerce sector.\n\nFurthermore, demonstrating consistent financial prowess, PDD has a track record of surpassing expectations, a streak it continued in the third quarter with impressive top and bottom-line results. It generated a whopping sales figure of $9.65 billion, a 96% improvement from the prior-year period, beating estimates by $2.2 billion. More importantly, it posted an EPS of $1.63, which beat estimates by 47 cents. Additionally, analysts expect another blockbuster showing for the company in its fourth quarter, with an expected sales figure of $10.7 billion, an 85% bump from the same period last year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

The assets also include shopping mall operator Intime, one of the sources said.\n\nDiscussions are at an early stage and Alibaba may decide not to proceed, the sources said.\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that Alibaba is considering selling InTime and has reached out to several firms to gauge their interest in acquiring its department store arm.\n\nAlibaba, RT-Mart and Intime did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Freshippo denied that Alibaba was planning to sell the company and declined to comment further.\n\nThe divestment efforts also come amid Alibaba's broad restructuring and China's tightened scrutiny over initial public offerings in a already challenging capital markets that have hampered startups' ability to raise funds.\n\nWu, who took office after predecessor Daniel Zhang stepped down in September, set out the company's future strategy two months later, saying that each of its businesses would face the market more independently and that it would conduct a strategic review to distinguish between \"core\" and \"non-core\" businesses.\n\n\"With the change of Alibaba management, they are more focused on their core business, which is obviously domestic e-commerce, and they want to invest in more AI, cloud computing, and also overseas expansion,\" said Jason Yu, greater China managing director of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"These offline businesses do require a huge amount of effort and resources and it's proven quite difficult to actually integrate with their core business, which is the online commerce business,\" he said.\n\nAlibaba announced a plan in March to split into six units and explore fundraisings or listings for most of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech\u2019s struggle to meet lofty investor expectations this earnings season has taken air out of a record-breaking stock run. Pressure is now on Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. to come through on Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing More Than Half of Swing-State Voters If Found Guilty Deutsche Bank Plans To Cut 3,500 Jobs And Lift Payouts House Passes $78 Billion Business, Child Tax Break Bill Donald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier Musk\u2019s $55 Billion Pay Package Voided, Threatening World\u2019s Biggest Fortune\n\nThe sector has led the S&P 500 lower this week after results from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. were met with selling by traders. Investors had bid up the stocks to records on bets that artificial intelligence efforts are set to provide a big lift to profits and sales.\n\n\u201cThe market seems to want more and more from these companies,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist of LPL Financial LLC. \u201cThe market knows it has gone too far too fast and is saying \u2018unless you astound us, we\u2019re going to bring you down a number of notches.\u2019\u201d\n\nBig Tech stocks powered the S&P 500\u2019s rally into record territory in January, but if this week is to set the tone for the month ahead, signs are pointing to uncertainty. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index suffered its biggest drop in three months on Wednesday after earnings disappointed and Fed Chair Jerome Powell dashed hopes of a March interest rate cut. Futures pointed to a rebound Thursday, however.\n\nRead more: Microsoft, Alphabet and AMD Struggle to Meet AI Expectations\n\nApple\u2019s results are top of mind for investors. The Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s shares have reflected concerns over sluggish iPhone sales and its slow-moving approach to artificial intelligence.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Apple to report about $118 billion in revenue for its first fiscal quarter, 1% higher than the same period a year ago. If the company meets the estimate, it would mark its first revenue expansion after four-consecutive quarters of declining sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nA narrow return to growth would come despite global challenges for Apple, which include Chinese restrictions on foreign technology and antitrust scrutiny in Europe. While the firm earned its reputation as one of the Magnificent Seven of 2023, jumping nearly 50% and hitting a record as recently as December, the stock has struggled this year.\n\nAt Amazon, the focus will be on its Amazon Web Services business, as well as expectations for its advertising segment after rolling out ads on the Prime Video service in the US.\n\nAWS sales are expected to expand 12% to $24 billion of Amazon\u2019s projected $166 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating profit is expected to nearly quadruple.\n\nFacebook-parent Meta Platforms is expected to deliver revenue of $39 billion in the fourth quarter, a 21% jump from the previous period. Of the three, the stock has posted the biggest gain in 2024, up 10%.\n\nThe company could begin to show some payoff from its AI investments, Bank of America analysts led by Justin Post wrote in a research note on Wednesday.\n\nThe long game\n\nOf course, even though tech stocks face a difficult setup in the coming weeks, it doesn\u2019t necessarily signal that the sector\u2019s market-leading rally is destined to end in the near future.\n\nThat\u2019s because the top technology firms are still seen as safe bets for investors looking to protect their portfolios against a potential economic downturn or further geopolitical uncertainty - they have strong balance sheets and are expected to continue to grow earnings.\n\n\u201cThey are the destination in nearly any scenario,\u201d because of the different macro backdrops they\u2019ve navigated, said Krosby.\n\nAnd a pullback in Big Tech after all-time highs isn\u2019t necessarily a bearish signal, especially if coupled with buying in smaller companies, showing a broadening of 2023\u2019s rally. It could also provide bulls with opportunities to add to their positions.\n\n\u201cThese are still the stocks that you want to be in and it\u2019s giving investors an opportunity to buy the dip,\u201d said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNvidia Corp. climbed 24% in January, its biggest monthly jump since May, in a clear indication that the chip giant is continuing to benefit from the artificial intelligence frenzy that gripped Wall Street over the past year. The rally dwarfed the 1.9% gain the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index made in the same period.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nIn an unscripted scene during tense testimony Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg apologized directly to the families of children who were victims of sexual exploitation on social media platforms. Elon Musk wants to deepen his links to Texas after a loss in court over his compensation at Tesla Inc.

        "content": "A popular video game developed by a Japanese studio has set off an unexpected cloud-computing race between Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, as the two Chinese tech giants rush to draw players to their respective servers.\n\nPalworld, an open-world survival game developed by Pocketpair that lets players catch and raise creatures known as Pals to build structures and fight, has become a breakout hit since its release on game distribution platform Steam on January 19, selling more than 8 million copies in less than six days.\n\nWith Pocketpair struggling to accommodate the surge of gamers that has overwhelmed its servers, the Tokyo-based company has given players the option to host the game on private servers.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nChinese cloud service providers, including Tencent and Post owner Alibaba, have seized on the opportunity to promote their server packages to mainland gamers.\n\nPalworld, known among gamers as \"Pokemon with guns\", has become in breakout hit around the world, including in China. Photo: Handout alt=Palworld, known among gamers as \"Pokemon with guns\", has become in breakout hit around the world, including in China. Photo: Handout>\n\nAlibaba is offering dedicated server plans for groups of eight or 20 Palworld players, with monthly fees ranging from 26.5 yuan to 271.8 yuan (US$3.71 to US$38.06). Tencent has also introduced similar packages, priced between 26 yuan and 580 yuan per month.\n\n\"In view of the popularity of Palworld ... which led to problems on the official servers, setting up private servers is the most stable and comfortable solution for those who are financially well-off,\" read a post on Tencent Cloud's official WeChat account published on January 25.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba and Tencent have repeatedly engaged in price wars in China's competitive cloud computing market.\n\nAlibaba Cloud announced last April that it was cutting the prices of its core products and services in China by 15 to 50 per cent. Tencent followed suit soon after, pledging to slash the costs of some of its cloud servers by as much as 40 per cent.\n\nAlibaba and Tencent are capitalising on the popularity of Palworld, which is currently the most-played game on Steam despite its hefty price tag of US$29.99. The average price for games sold on Steam, the world's largest digital distribution platform for computer games, is US$15.50.\n\nPlayers are mostly impressed by the game's clever mash-up of elements, including the thrill of monster-catching and the cute animated designs of those creatures, according to Zhang Shule, a game analyst at CBJ Think Tank.\n\nHowever, the game - known among players as \"Pokemon with guns\" - has also run into controversy. The Pokemon Company said last week that it planned to investigate claims that Palworld infringed on the intellectual property rights of its iconic franchise.\n\n\"We have received libellous comments about our artists and some tweets that seem close to death threats,\" Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe wrote last week on X, known formerly as Twitter.\n\nWhile Steam's global platform is inaccessible in mainland China, Palworld has caught on in the country, where players are known to buy and play games on Steam through virtual private networks.\n\nPalworld is also available on Microsoft's Xbox.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Hong Kong stocks rose after the Federal Reserve left the door open on monetary policy easing, with traders delaying their rate-cut bets to May. A private survey showed China's manufacturing industry expanded for a third month in January.\n\nThe Hang Seng Index advanced 0.5 per cent to 15,566.21 at the close, halting a two-day, 3.7 per cent slump. The Tech Index surged 2 per cent, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 per cent.\n\nAlibaba Group rebounded 2.2 per cent to HK$71.05, snapping a two-day slide.

The decision prompted traders to bets on a rate cut at the Fed's third meeting in early May, after Chair Jerome Powell suggested it would be premature to do so in March.\n\nThe odds of a rate cut in March fell overnight to about 35 per cent from about 73 per cent a month ago, according to data compiled by CME Group. There is about 61 per cent chance of a cut on May 1, versus 53 per cent a week ago, and 11 per cent a month earlier.\n\nThe Fed statement \"suggested the next move will be rate cuts,\" said Tai Hui, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"History suggests that both equities and bonds can deliver positive return when the Fed cuts rates as a precaution to engineer a soft landing, rather than reacting to a financial crisis or a severe recession.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere, the Caixin/S&P PMI Manufacturing Index held at 50.8 in January, staying in an expansionary mode for a third month. It contrasted with the official China PMI index this week that showed a fourth month of contraction.\n\nThe Hang Seng Index tumbled by 9.2 per cent in January, the worst since a 9.4 per cent slump in February last year. That setback also ranked as the worst among major equity benchmarks globally, amid worries about China's manufacturing slump, domestic price deflation and the yuan outlook.\n\nProperty developers declined after Hong Kong's monetary authority kept its base rate unchanged at 5.75 per cent in lockstep with the Fed's decision. Sun Hung Kai Properties slipped 0.4 per cent to HK$72.55 and CK Asset Holdings dropped 0.4 per cent to HK$35.10.\n\nOther major Asian markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.8 per cent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.2 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.8 per cent.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Ant Group and the Shanghai municipal government have struck a partnership that would see the two parties deepen their collaboration in fields such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nUnder the partnership, Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, will \"actively participate in building [an] artificial intelligence industry ecosystem and blockchain innovation platform in Shanghai\", according to a statement published on Wednesday. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe partnership signing ceremony was attended by Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng and Eric Jing Xiandong, chairman and chief executive at Ant.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Ant Group, which called off a mega initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong in late 2020, has undergone a reorganisation and ownership change to satisfy regulatory demands.\n\nJing lauded Shanghai for being an open, creative city that provides companies with a \"broad stage and space for development\".\n\nAlipay, the group's mobile payment service operator, has established its global headquarters in Shanghai. Ant Group will increase its investments in research and development with a view to \"helping with the city's economic and societal growth and its enterprises' participation in global trade\", according to Jing.\n\nAnt Group's tie-up with China's finance hub comes at a time when the city is looking to establish \"five centres\" for economy, finance, trade, shipping and scientific and technological innovation.\n\nThe municipality expects to leverage such partnerships to deepen its collaboration with corporate entities across a wide field, according to Mayor Gong, who added that Shanghai would endeavour to foster an environment that is conducive to businesses so they can grow their presence in the city.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeparately, other Alibaba businesses are beefing up their investments in the city.\n\nThe Damo Academy, Alibaba's in-house research facility, set up a new company in Shanghai on Tuesday, with 10 million yuan (US$1.4 million) in registered capital, according to records available on local business registry data service Qichacha.\n\nThe new firm, called Damo Academy (Shanghai) Technology Co, has a business scope that includes the design of integrated circuits, as well as AI software and algorithm development.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "ByteDance\u2019s CEO is mad at his employees for missing the AI wave. He\u2019s the latest Chinese tech executive to fret about being too slow to adapt",
        "content": "China's tech royalty is going through a bit of a shake-up. Upstarts like PDD Holdings, owner of Pinduoduo and Temu, and returning giants like Baidu, are taking advantage of changing e-commerce trends and the rise of AI to challenge firms like Alibaba, Tencent and JD. Even ByteDance, which revolutionized social media with its short-video apps Douyin and TikTok, is feeling the heat.\n\nByteDance CEO Liang Rubo was just the latest to fret about being left behind according to excerpts from his speech posted on the company's WeChat account. Liang complained that employees were \"not sensitive enough to external changes\" and griped that staff only started talking about ChatGPT, the buzzy chatbot developed by OpenAI that sparked the AI boom, in 2023.\n\nLiang warned that inefficiencies and a lack of speed would make ByteDance a \"mediocre organization.\" He cited one instance where a task was initially forecast to take 1,000 man-days to complete, a timeframe that was reduced to just 15 man-days after an in-depth review.\n\nMuch like in the U.S., China's tech sector is in the midst of its own race to adopt generative AI. The most prominent effort is from Baidu and its ERNIE chatbot, which the tech firm claims is as good as OpenAI's GPT-4 model. But Alibaba, Tencent, JD, and an array of Chinese startups are all launching their own AI services.\n\nByteDance launched its own chatbot, Doubao, in August last year. The Vergereported in mid-December that ByteDance was using OpenAI's technology to train its own chatbot, violating OpenAI's terms of service. OpenAI has since suspended ByteDance's account.\n\nLiang is the second Chinese tech CEO to complain about employees this week.\n\nOn Monday, Tencent CEO and co-founder Pony Ma told staff that the company's video game business \"achieved nothing\" last year. He complained that Tencent's new games did not perform as well as expected, reports Reuters. While Tencent's staple hits like Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile continue to deliver strong revenue, the company's newer games are losing to those from other Chinese developers like NetEase and miHoYo, developer of Genshin Impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nTencent's CEO now wants to juice more growth from WeChat, the company's ubiquitous messaging app. Ma told employees that they should \"find new sprouts from the old tree,\" referring to the now 13-year-old platform and its social media offerings.\n\nYet Ma was hesitant about expanding WeChat's other major offering. The platform also serves as one of China's two major digital payment processors, alongside Ant Group's Alipay. Ma reportedly told staff from the company's digital payments service unit to reduce its share in the market, and that the company should be viewed as \"a partner of banks.\"\n\nRegulators fined Tencent almost 3 billion yuan, or $422 million, last year for violating regulations regarding managing customer data.\n\nAlibaba and JD\n\nChina's e-commerce giants are also criticizing their employees for taking it easy.\n\nRicard Liu, chairman and founder of JD.com, told employees not to \"lie flat,\" referring to the Chinese slang term of doing the bare minimum to get by, in a post on the company's internal discussion board. Liu warned that, without change, there would be \"no way out for the company.\"\n\nLiu's warning followed a similar message from Jack Ma, founder of fellow e-commerce firm Alibaba. Ma took to Alibaba's internal forum in November calling for \"change and reform\" to the company, and praising newcomer PDD Holdings.\n\nPDD Holdings is the owner of the e-commerce platform Pinduoduo and the U.S.-based shopping platform Temu. In China, Pinduoduo tends to offer lower prices and also introduced group buying which allows consumers in community groups to buy items like groceries in bulk for a lower price.\n\nWhile Alibaba and JD.com generate more revenue than PDD, investors seem more bullish about PDD\u2019s prospects. PDD reported 94% year-on-year revenue growth for the quarter ending Sept. 30, and shares of PDD are up more than 20% in the past year contrasted with a drop in over 30% for Alibaba and over 60% for JD.com.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering selling its InTime department store arm, suggesting the Chinese internet company is rethinking a years-old ambition of dominating physical and online retail as it undergoes a broad restructuring.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing More Than Half of Swing-State Voters If Found Guilty Musk\u2019s $55 Billion Pay Package Voided, Threatening World\u2019s Biggest Fortune House Passes $78 Billion Business, Child Tax Break Bill S&P 500 Has Its Worst Fed-Decision Day Since March: Markets Wrap Byron Allen\u2019s Latest Takeover Bid: Paramount for $14 Billion\n\nAlibaba has reached out to several firms to tap their interest in acquiring the nationwide chain of more than 100 stores and malls, people familiar with the matter said. It initiated discussions around the time Joseph Tsai replaced Daniel Zhang at the helm of the e-commerce company in 2023, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private deal considerations. One potential buyer held talks as recently as last month, one of the people said.\n\nInTime was valued at roughly $4 billion in a 2017 take-private deal led by Alibaba. It\u2019s unclear if the company can drum up enough interest given a severe slump in post-Covid Chinese consumption, and the early, tentative negotiations may fall flat. Yet Alibaba\u2019s renewed efforts suggest Tsai and new Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu are considering their next steps in a broad-based overhaul of the once-dominant internet company.\n\nAn Intime sale would reverse one of the signature acquisitions under former boss Zhang, at a time Alibaba is struggling to grow its core business and resuscitate younger lines such as cloud services in the face of intense competition.\n\nThe company is reshuffling top management and considering how to retool a sprawling business that already spans endeavors from cloud services and semiconductors to travel and meal delivery. It is increasingly focusing on its core e-commerce business and the cloud operation. Alibaba representatives didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts retail business in particular has struggled to grow, even before Covid and the subsequent Chinese economic downturn.\n\nDuring his tenure, Zhang orchestrated the takeover of a plethora of brick-and-mortar chains to try and pioneer a \u201cnew retail\u201d model of physical commerce. From hypermart operator Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. to electronics retailer Suning, Alibaba invested billions of dollars to try and modernize old-economy retail using data and online services.\n\nOnce the centerpiece of Alibaba\u2019s growth strategy, executives have in recent years talked less about that concept, particularly after Beijing from 2020 launched an investigation into the company\u2019s alleged monopolistic behavior.\n\nThe focus is now on an internal restructuring it embarked on last year, though progress has been choppy. The company scuppered a spinoff of its $11 billion cloud division, and has yet to make significant progress after filing for an IPO of its Cainiao logistics division.\n\nIntime was once among Alibaba\u2019s biggest bets to revamp China\u2019s retail sector: The company led a deal to take the department store chain private for about $2.6 billion in 2017.\n\nIn December 2023, Alibaba set in motion a plan to create a firm to oversee its investments around the world. While the company hasn\u2019t clearly specified which assets might go into that portfolio, analysts have speculated that non-core assets \u2014 such as its physical retail operations \u2014 might go in that holding company and potentially get put up for sale.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s \u201cAll Others\u201d division \u2014 which encompasses non-core and retail businesses such as Intime \u2014 barely grew revenue to 93.9 billion yuan ($13.1 billion) for the six months ended September. That unit posted an adjusted loss before interest, tax and amortization of about 3 billion yuan, according to Alibaba\u2019s interim report.\n\nRead More: Alibaba Takes Big Step Offline With $2.6 Billion Intime Deal\n\n--With assistance from Jane Zhang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters There\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "title": "15 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 countries that produce the best software engineers. We will also discuss the growing apprehension regarding job security for software engineers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USA, Software Developers, Quality Assurance Analysts, and Testers earned a median pay of $124,200 per year in 2022. The field had 1,795,300 jobs in 2022, with a projected 25% job outlook from 2022 to 2032. This increase is expected to result in 451,200 new job opportunities.\n\nHowever, despite an excellent growth rate for the field,a recent survey conducted by Blind, an online anonymous platform, revealed that 90% of 9,338 polled software engineers believe it's now more challenging to secure a job compared to pre-pandemic times, with 66% stating it is \"much harder.\" The competitive environment is evident as 80% of respondents claim the job market has become more intense over the past year. Shockingly, only 6% of software engineers express confidence in finding a new job with equivalent compensation, while 32% are \"not at all confident.\" In 2022 and 2023, the tech sector saw over 400,000 layoffs, challenging the perception that software engineers were relatively immune.\n\nThe report suggests a huge shift in the perception of job security within the software engineering field, traditionally considered a haven. The increase in competition is attributed to a combination of industry-wide downturn and the growing influence of artificial intelligence. The emergence of AI-powered coding tools and their potential to streamline processes has fueled concerns about job security in the tech sector. Despite 28% expressing concerns about AI in their own roles, over 60% believe their companies will hire fewer people due to AI in the future, signaling a growing apprehension within the software engineering community.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing the continuous lay off trends in the tech industry, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has announced layoffs affecting 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox, marking approximately 8% of the overall Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Gaming division, which employs around 22,000 people. The internal memo from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0 Gaming CEO Phil Spencer confirmed the decision who highlighted that there is a need for a sustainable cost structure to support the growing business.\n\nThe layoffs come just three months after Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) \u2018s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Alongside the job cuts, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra is leaving the company, and Blizzard's chief design officer, Allen Adham, is also departing. The memo reveals the cancellation of Blizzard's previously announced survival game, with affected employees being shifted to other early-stage projects.\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s last major layoffs occurred a year ago, impacting 10,000 employees. The company is set to report its fiscal Q2 2024 earnings, which will include the first results after the Activision Blizzard acquisition, next week.\n\nOn the other hand, Datadog, Inc (NASDAQ:DDOG) has emerged as a pivotal player in the tech and software industry, providing a comprehensive observability service for cloud-scale applications. Originally conceived as a solution to bridge the gap between developer and systems administration teams, Datadog, Inc (NASDAQ:DDOG)\u00a0 swiftly evolved into a cloud infrastructure monitoring service and now offers dashboards, alerting, and metric visualizations. Its growth parallels the increase in cloud adoption, with the platform expanding to cover major service providers like AWS, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.\n\nDatadog, Inc (NASDAQ:DDOG)\u2018s technology features a Go-based agent and support for over 600 integrations across various cloud service providers and has become instrumental in optimizing system performance and troubleshooting. Recognized in Forbes' Cloud 100 and Deloitte's Fast 500 List, Datadog, Inc (NASDAQ:DDOG)\u00a0 is one of the fastest-growing and influential companies, playing a pertinent role in advancing the efficiency and reliability of modern software ecosystems. 15 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers.\n\nAn experienced software engineer working on a complex line of code in a programming suite.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile a list of countries that produce the best software engineers, we utilized the QS World University Rankings for 2023 in Computer Science and Information Systems.

        "title": "History Says Value Stocks Could Soar This Year. Here Are 2 Stocks to Buy.",
        "content": "There's a place for stocks trading at low valuations (generally referred to as value stocks) in a well-rounded investment strategy. History shows that the relative performance between value and growth stocks can sometimes move back and forth like a game of tug of war.\n\nBut the underperformance of either group has never been this lopsided. Research from Patient Capital Management found that, between 2007 and 2020, value stocks underperformed growth stocks by 150% -- the worst performance by either group in the last 50 years.\n\nWhile growth stocks generally are the best way to grow your savings over the long term, identifying stocks trading at low valuations or price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios can be beneficial when the markets turn volatile. VTV Chart\n\nFor example, through the market correction in 2022, the Vanguard Value ETF significantly outperformed the Vanguard Growth ETF, which shows how well-chosen value stocks can offset the declines in your growth stocks when the markets slide. The key is to be selective and focus on quality companies that lead their respective markets.\n\nHere's why Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) and jeweler Signet Jewelers(NYSE: SIG) are two great value stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Alibaba\n\nThe largest e-commerce and cloud services provider in China, a company that generates $130 billion in annual revenue, is trading at a fire-sale valuation of just 6.3 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. The stock has fallen over the last few years due to a weak economy, concern about U.S.-China relations, and increasing competition in e-commerce in China. Its price is getting too cheap to ignore.\n\nDespite the obstacles, the stock's reduced valuation doesn't seem justified. Alibaba has enormous cash resources to reinvest in the business and weather the economic turbulence. It also is facing a massive opportunity in the growing adoption of artificial intelligence services in China.\n\nMcKinsey & Co. estimates AI could add $600 billion in economic value to China in the years to come. That is almost as much as the entire gross domestic product of Shanghai, one of China's largest cities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba has the customer reach and technology to be a leader in China's booming AI economy. The company's Taobao marketplace had 895 million monthly active users through September 2023. Management credited the growth in its core marketplace business in the September-ending quarter to its wide offering of brands and merchants, in addition to AI-driven technology, such as virtual try-on features in the app.\n\nDespite these advantages, revenue growth from Taobao and Tmall still decelerated last quarter to just 4% year over year. The competition from other marketplaces and macroeconomic challenges are taking their toll, but Alibaba has tools to fight back. The company has yet to fully flex its financial strength to more aggressively lower prices, which could put more pressure on smaller competitors.\n\nAll told, Alibaba's technology, wide customer reach, and profitability, where it generates $30 billion in trailing free cash flow, are worth betting on at these bargain-basement share prices. The stock could be a grand slam for investors if the stock eventually returns to the same price-to-earnings valuation as before the pandemic.\n\n2. Signet Jewelers\n\nInvesting in top jewelry brands can be a rewarding investment at the right price. Signet Jewelers operates the largest collection of store brands, including Zales, Jared, Kay Jewelers, and online leader Blue Nile, among others. It's not a fast grower, but management has implemented a successful acquisition strategy to assemble this leading collection of brands, and the stock is cheap enough to deliver spectacular returns over the next five years.\n\nAfter a slump in sales over the last few years, the company saw demand for engagement rings rise toward the end of 2023. Improving sales in bridal, which generates half the company's merchandise sales, is a catalyst for growth.\n\nSignet's sales were down 12% year over year last quarter, as the company's bridal business is expected to remain soft in the near term. But sales of engagement rings build long-term relationships with customers, and this fuels growth in services, which could be a source of expanding margins down the road.\n\nSignet management projects annual adjusted earnings will reach at least $14 per share over the long term as bridal demand returns. That puts the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio at just 7 -- a bargain, considering the company's record of profitable growth.\n\nThe stock rallied at the end of last year following healthy Black Friday sales in the holiday quarter. Moreover, Signet pays a small dividend yield of 0.93% to shareholders, reflecting management's confidence in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alibaba Group wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Alibaba Stock (NYSE:BABA): New Bullish Catalysts Have Emerged",
        "content": "Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), the Chinese tech giant, disappointed investors in 2023 while many of its American counterparts delivered strong returns. Alibaba stock has declined almost 40% in the last 12 months, but new catalysts have emerged to drive the stock higher in 2024. Although regulatory risks need to be monitored carefully, I am bullish on Alibaba stock.\n\nSoftBank Finally Completes Divesting Alibaba\n\nSoftBank (OTC:SFTBF), the Japanese investment firm led by billionaire Masayoshi Son, was one of the first institutional investors to believe in Alibaba. The investment firm invested $20 million in Alibaba in 2000. In late 2021, SoftBank entered into a forward contract with its subsidiary Skybridge to divest its Alibaba stake. This contract allowed SoftBank to repurchase Alibaba shares from Skybridge if needed.\n\nOn January 25, SoftBank announced the settlement of these prepaid forward contracts with Skybridge, reportedly booking a profit of around $8.5 billion from its investment in Alibaba. The investment firm has decided not to purchase or sell any new Alibaba shares in the foreseeable future. The firm currently owns a minor stake in Alibaba of approximately 0.5%, in contrast to an ownership stake of 32% back in 2021.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the massive selling pressure created by SoftBank over the last couple of years acted as a barrier for Alibaba stock to trend higher despite the company spending massive amounts on share buybacks. For reference, the company spent $10.2 billion on stock repurchases in the last 12 months.\n\nGoing forward, it seems reasonable to assume that buybacks will finally create a positive impact, assuming the company continues to perform well financially.\n\nThe Founder and President Are Betting on Alibaba\n\nOn January 23, SEC filings revealed that Alibaba founder Jack Ma and current Chairman Joe Tsai both purchased company shares, indicating their improving sentiment toward the company\u2019s prospects at a time when SoftBank is exiting its investment. Mr. Ma purchased Alibaba shares worth $50 million, while Mr. Tsai invested $151 million in the company through his family investment fund.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing these transactions, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai became the two largest shareholders of the company, ending SoftBank\u2019s reign that spanned several years. The founding members\u2019 return as largest shareholders is likely to boost investor sentiment in the coming months, which was evident from the initial market reaction on January 23, when Alibaba stock jumped more than 7% following the release of SEC filings highlighting these transactions.\n\nAlibaba Enjoys a Long Runway to Grow\n\nAlibaba\u2019s investment appeal stems from two factors: the long growth runway enjoyed by the company and its cheap valuation.\n\nAlibaba has emerged as a leader in the cloud computing space in China, which is a market that is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years, with companies of all scales and sizes moving to the cloud. According to Canalys data, Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the cloud market in China at the end of Q1 2023, with Huawei Cloud in second place with a market share of 20%.\n\nAccording to Statista, revenue in the Chinese public cloud sector will grow at a CAGR of 18.7% through 2028, resulting in a market value of $137 billion at the end of the forecast period. The ongoing integration of AI capabilities in the cloud market will be one of the key growth drivers in the next five years.\n\nAlibaba enjoys quantifiable pricing power in this market segment, and the company has reported consistently higher renewal rates compared to many of its peers. These observations suggest that Alibaba is well-positioned to make the most of the expected growth in the cloud market.\n\nThe company is integrating AI into its digital retail technologies, including the development of unified core technology and solving language translation challenges. In the digital media entertainment segment, the company is using AI to create next-generation content and to achieve process-based digitalized film and TV show production capabilities.\n\nAlthough a full business separation may not be in the cards anymore, Alibaba continues to find ways to manage its business units independently, which should enable the company to unlock hidden value in the coming years. This will be another growth driver.\n\nAt a more granular level, the company has come up with ambitious visions for each of its key business segments. Examples include 1688 aiming to leverage products manufactured in China with business customers in mind, Xianyu seeking to become a lifestyle platform without limiting itself to secondhand goods, DingTalk aiming to become the best AI smart assistant system in China, Quark targeting students to sell its knowledge products, and Youku committing to prioritize self-produced content to compete in the video content niche.\n\nIs Alibaba Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nBased on the ratings of 20 Wall Street analysts, BABA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. The average Alibaba stock price target is $118.20, which implies upside potential of 63.4% from the current market price.\n\nAlibaba is trading at a meaningful discount to its historical valuation multiples and also compared to its American counterparts. The company is valued at a forward P/E of 8.2 compared to its five-year average forward P/E of 18.15. To add more context, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at a forward P/E of 59.4.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cheap valuation has attracted many Wall Street bulls in recent months, but its stock has not performed up to expectations due to investor worries about Chinese regulators and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nThe Takeaway: Alibaba Stock Is Closer to Turning a Corner\n\nAlibaba has remained cheaply valued for about two years. Today, new catalysts have emerged to drive the stock higher in the form of SoftBank completing its planned divestment of Alibaba shares and the improving regulatory improvement. The company seems attractively valued for long-term-oriented investors at a time when tables are turning in favor of the company both from a regulatory and financial performance perspective.\n\nDisclosure",
