(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nThe company\u2019s Nourish the Children initiative feeds thousands of children each day\n\nPROVO, Utah, July 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE: NUS), a global leader in beauty and wellness, today announced it has reached the milestone of providing 850 million meals for children since 2002 through its Nourish the Children initiative. Malnourished children in more than 65 countries around the world have been fed VitaMeal,* a nutrient-dense food, from one of the company\u2019s third-party charity partners after Nu Skin sales leaders, customers or employees purchase and donate bags of food.\n\n\"When we started the Nourish the Children initiative more than 20 years ago, we could have never imagined the sustained impact it would have on so many children,\" said Ryan Napierski, president and CEO at Nu Skin. \"It\u2019s humbling to think about the impact of providing 850 million meals to malnourished children around the world. The collective good that we do as a company is a testament to our sales force, customers and employees.\"\n\nAbout VitaMeal\n\nUnlike simple grains with a mostly caloric benefit, VitaMeal is a nutrient-dense food scientifically formulated to meet the nutritional needs of malnourished children. As part of the overall development of VitaMeal, Nu Skin's nutritional scientists determined the ingredients and ratios that are well suited for a malnourished child. The result is a product that provides essential vitamins and minerals, with a balance of carbohydrates, protein, fat and fiber.\n\nAbout Nourish the Children\n\nIn 2002, Nu Skin took action to address the tragedy of childhood hunger and malnutrition with the development of the Nourish the Children initiative with a highly nutritious food known as VitaMeal, developed by Nu Skin's nutritional scientists. The company's sales leaders, customers and employees can purchase VitaMeal and then choose to keep it or donate the food to a third-party nonprofit organization that specializes in distributing relief to those suffering from malnutrition and famine.\n\nAbout Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.\n\nThe Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: NUS) family of companies includes Nu Skin and Rhyz Inc. Nu Skin is an integrated beauty and wellness company, powered by a dynamic affiliate opportunity platform, which operates in nearly 50 markets worldwide.

Nourish the Children is an initiative of Nu Skin and is registered in some states as a commercial co-venture. The initiative enables Nu Skin\u2019s Brand Affiliates and customers to purchase VitaMeal from Nu Skin and donate it to charitable organizations to help solve the complex world problem of feeding malnourished children. The price of VitaMeal includes the cost of manufacturing, general overhead, distribution and sales. As is the case with other Nu Skin products, Brand Affiliates are paid commissions and Nu Skin earns a profit margin from each sale of VitaMeal.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240726855752/en/\n\nContacts\n\nMedia: media@nuskin.com, (801) 345-6397\r\nInvestors: investorrelations@nuskin.com, (801) 345-3577\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In today\u2019s volatile market, identifying stocks to sell is critical to preserving capital invested. As economic uncertainties loom, learning which investments might falter can safeguard portfolios. Here, the focus is on three stocks that hold vulnerabilities, signaling potential downturns. Each company faces unique adversities.\n\nTo begin with, the first one contends with fluctuating international currencies impacting the\u00a0top-line. Meanwhile, the second one needs help with subdued consumer spending on high-ticket items. Finally, the third one navigates turbulence stemming from strategic restructuring moves. These factors collectively highlight their susceptibility to broader economic downturns. They are making these companies prime candidates for investors considering a strategic exit.\n\nTo put it briefly, these businesses suffer from\u00a0basic\u00a0market dynamics flaws. Selling them can reduce risk and improve the portfolio\u2019s performance. It is crucial to actively manage assets, investigate novel approaches, and understand why certain stocks are worth watching during economic ups and downs. Investigating these businesses\u2019 complexities can help one make informed investing choices in today\u2019s erratic stock market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNu Skin Enterprises (NUS) woman smiling with white background\n\nSource: Odua Images via Shutterstock\n\nNu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS) is a direct-selling company that offers a range of skincare and nutritional products. The company had a top-line of $417.3 million for Q1 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0was impacted negatively by foreign currency fluctuations, amounting to a 3.8% decrease or approximately $18.2 million.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates that a considerable portion of Nu Skin\u2019s\u00a0top-line\u00a0is subject to currency exchange rates. It can fluctuate unpredictably and impact performance adversely. The negative FX impact of 3.8% on\u00a0top-line highlights the vulnerability of Nu Skin\u2019s results to international currency movements. This dependency makes forecasting complex and hinders consistent growth.\n\nMoreover, Nu Skin has adversities in several international markets due to macroeconomic conditions, such as heavy inflationary pressures affecting consumer spending. Specific regions, like South Korea and Japan, were mentioned. Economic factors like housing market crises and unfavorable consumer sentiments have dampened growth prospects. Despite moves to manage expenses and optimize costs, Nu Skin\u2019s gross margin decreased to 70.5% from\u00a072.3% annually, partly due to these external economic pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Nu Skin\u2019s exposure to forex volatility and economic adversities in\u00a0key\u00a0markets makes it a top mark on the top stocks to sell list.\n\nBig Lots (BIG) Photo of a Big Lots (BIG) store shot from the parking lot with a shopping cart in the foreground and clear blue sky in the background. BIG stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) is a discount retailer that sells a variety of merchandise, including furniture, home decor and consumer goods. There is a considerable consumer pullback on big-ticket items. Despite moves to maintain market lead, these discretionary categories experienced a solid decline, negatively impacting sales performance. In Q1 2024, Big Lots delivered a comp sales decline of 9.9%, missing their mid-single-digit guidance. The high-ticket\u00a0items like furniture and patio furniture needed to perform better, contributing to the sales miss.\n\nAdditionally, Big Lots has made strides in increasing the penetration of extreme bargains and optimizing its product assortment.\u00a0This\u00a0is particularly true through its five key action strategies. The heavy mix in home furnishing categories remains a drag on performance. The strategy to achieve\u00a075% bargain penetration and increase extreme bargain penetration to 50% by year-end reflects a proactive pricing and assortment management approach. However, the disproportionate impact of slow-moving categories like furniture underscores a strategic vulnerability that limits the company\u2019s agility in responding to changing consumer preferences.\n\nTherefore, Big Lots is at the top\u00a0of the\u00a0list of stocks to sell due to declining consumer spending on high-ticket items and reliance on underperforming product categories.\n\nWorthington Industries (WOR) Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steel\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWorthington Industries (NYSE:WOR) leads in products such as steel, aluminum and specialty metals. In Q4 fiscal 2024, Worthington delivered a loss from continuing operations amounting to 64 cents, a stark contrast to the earnings of $1.01 per share delivered in Q4 2023. This downturn in profitability can largely\u00a0be attributed\u00a0to restructuring, impairment and one-time charges totaling $74 million.\u00a0This\u00a0translates to $1.38 per share. These charges primarily stem from selling a 51% stake in their Sustainable Energy Solutions segment to form a joint venture with Hexagon Composites.\n\nSuch strategic moves may also improve focus or streamline processes but they have had a significant instant impact. Furthermore, Worthington\u2019s performance represented\u00a0larger\u00a0obstacles across all of its parts.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Outperformers: USANA (NYSE:USNA) And The Rest Of The Personal Care Stocks\n\nLooking back on personal care stocks' Q1 earnings, we examine this quarter's best and worst performers, including USANA (NYSE:USNA) and its peers.\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.1%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 7.5% below consensus. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, and personal care stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 5.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nUSANA (NYSE:USNA)\n\nGoing to market with a direct selling model rather than through traditional retailers, USANA Health Sciences (NYSE:USNA) manufactures and sells nutritional, personal care, and skincare products.\n\nUSANA reported revenues of $227.8 million, down 8.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. Overall, it was an ok quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts' earnings estimates but full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations.\n\n\u201cOur top line results during the first quarter were driven by a successful sales incentive in mainland China, which helped counter the seasonal slowdown that we experience during the Lunar New Year holiday,\u201d said Jim Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer.

        "title": "Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 80% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Nu Skin Enterprises implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 50% of the business is held by the top 10 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 80% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nu Skin Enterprises.\n\nView our latest analysis for Nu Skin Enterprises  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nu Skin Enterprises?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Nu Skin Enterprises does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Nu Skin Enterprises, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Nu Skin Enterprises is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 17% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 13% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.\n\nWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Nu Skin Enterprises\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nShareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$545m, and insiders have US$11m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Nu Skin Enterprises. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Nu Skin Enterprises better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Nu Skin Enterprises  you should know about.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Stocks to Sell Before the Bubble Bursts",
        "content": "Finding overvalued stocks to sell is crucial for investors to safeguard their portfolios in today\u2019s erratic markets. Here, the emphasis is on three well-known businesses whose valuation measures have lately come under investigation. Though each firm works in a different industry\u2014cash, direct marketing, or cryptocurrency\u2014they are all seen to be overpriced. Analyzing these stocks\u2019 financial fundamentals and market dynamics is necessary to understand why they are associated with downside risks.\n\nFrom volatile cryptocurrency markets to tactical changes affecting cannabis sales to financial strains, every example sheds light on possible weak points. These businesses have difficulties that can jeopardize their market positions and investor trust against shifting regulations, economic downturns, and strategic pivots. Understanding the warning signals of overvaluation is essential to protecting portfolios. An analysis of these case studies gives a more profound comprehension of the reasons behind these stocks\u2019 potential risk status as investments.\u00a0This\u00a0is consistent with managing portfolio risks in unstable market situations.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) operates a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Increased volatility and pricing in cryptocurrency assets contributed to Coinbase\u2019s notable 103% sequential gain in transaction revenue in Q1 2024. Although the Q1 results were positively impacted, Coinbase\u2019s reliance on the cryptocurrency market exposes the company to its inherent volatility.\u00a0This\u00a0can cause significant fluctuations and impact the stability of its income in the coming quarters.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough the business reports that Q1 market conditions were encouraging, historical patterns indicate that cryptocurrency assets\u2019 market capitalization and prices can be\u00a0volatile. Hence, sustained revenue growth might be jeopardized by this uncertainty, particularly if market circumstances improve or deteriorate.\n\nTotal expenses rose by 5% every quarter due\u00a0to increasing stock-based compensation and other operating expenditures. For Q2, the business expects to see more increases in administrative, marketing, and technology and development costs. Based on increased trading volumes and customer support requirements, these forecasts indicate that profitability margins will continue under pressure.\n\nOverall, Coinbase is on the overvalued stocks to sell list due to its top- and bottom-line volatility and dependence on the crypto ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nAurora Cannabis (ACB) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of cannabinoid company Aurora Cannabis (ACB, blurred marijuana leaf (focus on left part of letter R in center)\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock.com\n\nAurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) leads in the cannabis market. Over the year, the company\u2019s net revenue from consumer cannabis decreased from $14.5 million to $10.2 million (fiscal 2024). The reduction can be attributable to the shift towards higher-margin medicinal cannabis sales in foreign markets over consumer products with lower profits.\n\nThe consumer cannabis industry\u2019s adjusted gross margin dropped dramatically from 25% to\u00a016%, suggesting a less desirable product mix than the year before. Even if it is not as profitable as medicinal cannabis, consumer cannabis nonetheless commands a considerable portion of the market. In developed countries like Canada and emerging markets, this is crucial.\n\nFurther, the drop in this segment\u2019s revenue and profitability raises the possibility that Aurora is losing market share or needs help competing successfully. The strategic shift away from consumer cannabis may limit Aurora\u2019s ability to capitalize on the full spectrum of the cannabis market, including recreational users and less\u00a0medically stringent markets, as the company concentrates more on high-margin medical cannabis markets, such as those in Europe and Australia.\n\nIn short, Aurora\u2019s shift away from consumer cannabis may negatively impact revenue growth, solidifying its place on the overvalued stocks to sell list.\n\nNu Skin (NUS) woman smiling with white background\n\nSource: Odua Images via Shutterstock\n\nNu Skin (NYSE:NUS) leads the direct sale of skincare and nutritional products. But customers and paid affiliates have significantly decreased, according to Nu Skin. In particular, annual declines in paid affiliates and consumers totaled 19% and 30%, respectively (adjusted to 14% ignoring eligibility changes).\n\nAdditionally, the negative consumer moods brought on by regional economic problems (such as South Korea\u2019s property market crisis) and\u00a0strong\u00a0forex pressures have made things more difficult in some areas, such as South Korea and Japan. Nu Skin has struggled to increase sales, leading trends, and its client base.\n\nMoreover, revenue for Nu Skin in Q1 2024 was\u00a0$417.3 million, a 13.3% decline from the $481.5 million in the same quarter the previous year. With 154,171 paid affiliates, there was a solid decrease of 30% from the previous year. When eligibility modifications were taken into account, there was a 14% decline. Despite attempts to reduce SKUs, Nu Skin\u2019s gross margin dropped from 72.3% to 70.5% annually, suggesting pressure on profitability.\n\nTo conclude, Nu Skin needs help with declining customer and affiliate numbers amidst economic challenges. These elements led the company\u2019s presence on the overvalued stock list to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Optimizing portfolios may require scanning stocks to sell before a certain period. Understanding which stocks might provide hazards is more important than ever as July 2024 approaches. Businesses frequently encounter particular obstacles. These may result from changing market conditions, operational problems, or strategic errors that, over time, reduce market value. In short, finding the stocks to dump before July 2024 requires proactive portfolio management rather than pessimism.\n\nThese three companies should\u00a0be considered\u00a0for divestiture before the middle of 2024. Every company has\u00a0challenges, such as being vulnerable to currency changes that impact profits, declining sales in specific categories, and being exposed to unstable semiconductor markets and geopolitical threats. Looking at these examples, one may find geopolitical risks, obstacles unique to a\u00a0certain\u00a0industry, and operational inefficiencies. These insights enable portfolios to be in line with current market circumstances and provide protection against future financial downturns.\n\nNu Skin (NUS) woman smiling with white background\n\nSource: Odua Images via Shutterstock\n\nNu Skin (NYSE:NUS) operates in the personal care and wellness industry. Q1 2024\u2019s gross margin decreased from 72.3% to 70.5% from the previous year\u2019s quarter. A weaker foreign currency position raises the cost of items sold when the top line is translated back to the reporting currency. The gross margin for the Nu Skin core business increased from 76.4% in Q1 2023 to 76.9% (+0.5%).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the operating margin for the quarter came to\u00a02.1% or 3.8%, with restructuring expenses subtracted.\u00a0This\u00a0is a drop from the previous year\u2019s 3.3%, or 5.4%, without restructuring expenses. Despite cost-cutting efforts, the reduced operating margin shows that FX pressures have a\u00a0real\u00a0impact on profitability. The requirement to handle debt in different currencies is also a reason for the rise in interest expenditure from $4.9 million in the previous year to $7.3 million in the current quarter. Hence, this underscores the financial burden FX fluctuation can bring under the ongoing higher-for-longer environment.\n\nOverall, Nu Skin\u2019s inclusion on the list of stocks to sell before July 2024 list stems from its vulnerability to foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nWorthington (WOR) A close-up shot of a cobalt pile in front of a black background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWorthington (NYSE:WOR) is a diversified metals manufacturing company. Worthington\u2019s building products category experienced the most significant decline in net sales, dropping by $35.8 million in Q3 fiscal 2024. Specifically, reduced volumes, an unfavorable product mix, and lower average selling prices led to this decline. This segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA dropped from $58 million in Q3 2023 to $53 million.\u00a0This\u00a0is a $5 million decline attributed to lower sales and an unfavorable product mix that hurt profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, comparing the performance from the previous year to breakeven, Sustainable Energy Solutions reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of\u00a0$3 million. The segment\u2019s volumes remained too low to absorb fixed expenses, causing this negative EBITDA, even with an 11% rise in net sales. Due to reduced gross profit and increased selling and administration expenditures, the operating income for Q3 decreased to $8 million on an adjusted basis from $16.9 million in Q3 2023, indicating a sizable decline in profitability.\n\nTo sum up, Worthington faces challenges due to declining sales caused by lower volumes, pricing pressures, and an unfavorable product mix, putting it on the list of stocks to dump before July 2024.\n\nAxcelis (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis (NASDAQ:ACLS) designs, manufactures, and services ion implantation and processing equipment\u00a0for semiconductor chips. While Axcelis\u2019spower segment is resilient and may continue to grow throughout the year, other market segments are struggling and may not recover until 2025. With 59% of total sales in the first quarter of 2024 coming from China, the country represents a significant geographic market for Axcelis. Because of this high top-line concentration, the company is more exposed to the geopolitical and economic risks associated with the Chinese market.\n\nAdditionally, fewer sales shares go to the US, Japan, Europe, Korea, and the rest of the globe (17%, 7%, 4%, 4%, and 9%, respectively), suggesting a persistent lack of geographic diversity. Moreover, fluctuations in gross margins based on product mix indicate vulnerability. For instance, changes in the product mix and the shutdown of assessment systems\u2014which typically provide lower profits\u2014will likely result in variations in the gross margins for each quarter.\n\nTo conclude, Axcelis faces market segment challenges, particularly in memory markets like DRAM and NAND, with significant geopolitical risks in China posing potential threats.

        "content": "In a market like this, you should identify stocks most likely to underperform as a way of protecting your portfolio. Some stocks have had poor performances in the past years but then they have some very significant challenges that can take their value into a slump.\n\nDeep, top-line declines and restructuring deceleration have weighed down these same companies, and this usually consumes a lot of sales headwinds from various sectors. Realizing them early enough as an investor helps you make informed decisions and become cautious regarding losses.\n\nStocks to sell are those that have performed poorly with declining revenue, deteriorating profit margins or adverse market conditions. We identify must-sell stocks by considering factors like their financial health, market trends, and the effects of external factors upon them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three companies currently finding the going very rough and seem to be on the way to a downturn. Their recent financial and market challenges suggest they may not recover soon, qualifying them as stocks to sell.\n\nSnap (SNAP) Advertiser Appeal and Innovations Will Continue to Lift Snap Stock\n\nSource: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Snap (NYSE:SNAP) derived a 21% YoY boost in sales in Q1 2024, the company has projected a 15% to 18% growth rate in Q2 2024. Compared to the first quarter, this estimate indicates a three- to six-point slowdown.\n\nMoreover, the Middle East conflict was one of the major external variables influencing the total advertising income growth rate in non-North American areas, including Europe and the rest of the world (ROW). Thus, the unstable climate created by these geopolitical considerations may make it difficult for Snap to maintain steady revenue growth in all markets.\n\nAdditionally, Snap\u2019s revenue is primarily derived from advertising. Despite surging\u00a0194% year-over-year to $87 million in the period, other revenue streams such as Snapchat+ subscriptions still comprise only a small portion of the consolidated top line. Because of its dependence on advertising, Snap is highly sensitive to ups and downs in advertiser spending, economic downturns and ad industry swings.\n\nFinally, losses narrowed slightly from last year. Snap recorded a $305 million net loss versus losses of $329 million a year ago. Hence, Snap is still losing a lot of money even with the decrease, raising questions about its long-term viability.\n\nNu Skin (NUS) woman smiling with white background\n\nSource: Odua Images via Shutterstock\n\nFor Q1 2024, Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) reported a significant decrease in revenue, down 13.3% from last year. The decrease was exacerbated by negative foreign exchange (FX) impacts of $18.2 million, or 3.8%. The company\u2019s susceptibility to currency rate changes is a clear concern.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the business posted a loss of 1 cent for the quarter or an adjusted profit of 9 cents when excluding restructuring expenses.\u00a0This is a significant decrease from profits of 23 cents and 37 cents, respectively, last year. Hence, the severity of this profit decline underscores the serious underlying financial difficulties Nu Skin is facing.\n\nFurther, Nu Skin\u2019s clientele dropped from 1,080,915 to 875,261, a 19% decrease. In addition, there were 154,171 paid affiliates as opposed to 220,216 a year ago, a 30% decline. The significant drop in affiliates and consumers points to systemic problems with affiliate recruiting and retention. These are essential to the business\u2019s direct selling strategy.\n\nLastly, there were 38,609 sales leaders, down 12% from 43,870. This drop is very problematic, given the importance of sales leaders in generating revenue and attracting new affiliates.\n\nAvnet (AVT) The logo for Avnet (AVT) is seen on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAvnet (NASDAQ:AVT) reported a significant revenue decline for Q3 fiscal 2024, down 12.3% YoY. This decline is a crucial symptom of the business\u2019 difficulties in maintaining its market position and rate of expansion.\n\nAdditionally, Avnet\u2019s revenues are declining globally, not just in a specific region. Sales in the Americas fell by 18% from last year,\u00a0Europe, Middle East and Africa were down 15% and Asia by 7% in constant currency. This global decline in revenues underscores Avnet\u2019s challenge in continuing to grow over its entire global footprint.\n\nMoreover, the operating income margin for the third quarter of the year was reported to be 3.4%, down 1.4 percentage points from Q3 2023\u2019s 4.8%. After rising to 4.8% YoY, the adjusted operating income margin decreased to 3.6%. This margin drop reflects the difficult market circumstances, further straining the business\u2019s profitability.\n\nFinally, despite reporting an operating margin of 4.1%, the electronic components (EC) industry faces significant challenges in maintaining profitability due to diminishing revenues, making it a prime candidate for the stocks to sell list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Unpacking Q1 Earnings: BeautyHealth (NASDAQ:SKIN) In The Context Of Other Personal Care Stocks\n\nThe end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how BeautyHealth (NASDAQ:SKIN) and the rest of the personal care stocks fared in Q1.\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.1%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 7.5% below consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the personal care stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 1.9% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nBeautyHealth (NASDAQ:SKIN)\n\nOperating in the emerging beauty health category, the appropriately named BeautyHealth (NASDAQ:SKIN) is a skincare company best known for its Hydrafacial product that cleanses and hydrates skin.\n\nBeautyHealth reported revenues of $81.4 million, down 5.7% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was an ok quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates but revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts' expectations.\n\n\"Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making on our near-term strategic priorities, including sales excellence, operational excellence, and financial discipline,\u201d said BeautyHealth Chief Executive Officer Marla Beck.

It was a weak quarter for the company, with revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts' expectations and a miss of analysts' operating margin estimates.\n\nMedifast had the slowest revenue growth in the group. The stock is down 38% since the results and currently trades at $22.\n\nRead our full analysis of Medifast's results here.\n\nNu Skin (NYSE:NUS)\n\nWith person-to-person marketing and sales rather than selling through retail stores, Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) is a personal care and dietary supplements company that engages in direct selling.\n\nNu Skin reported revenues of $417.3 million, down 13.3% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 3.5%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations.\n\nNu Skin had the weakest performance against analyst estimates among its peers.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nNu Skin Enterprises' Annual General Meeting to take place on 5th of June Salary of US$991.9k is part of CEO Ryan Napierski's total remuneration Total compensation is 136% above industry average Nu Skin Enterprises' three-year loss to shareholders was 76% while its EPS was down 69% over the past three years\n\nNu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) has not performed well recently and CEO Ryan Napierski will probably need to up their game. At the upcoming AGM on 5th of June, shareholders can hear from the board including their plans for turning around performance. This will be also be a chance where they can challenge the board on company direction and vote on resolutions such as executive remuneration. From our analysis, we think CEO compensation may need a review in light of the recent performance.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Nu Skin Enterprises\n\nComparing Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nAccording to our data, Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$663m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$5.8m over the year to December 2023. We note that's an increase of 23% above last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$992k.\n\nFor comparison, other companies in the American Personal Products industry with market capitalizations ranging between US$400m and US$1.6b had a median total CEO compensation of US$2.5m. This suggests that Ryan Napierski is paid more than the median for the industry. Moreover, Ryan Napierski also holds US$1.4m worth of Nu Skin Enterprises stock directly under their own name.\n\nComponent 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$992k US$942k 17% Other US$4.8m US$3.8m 83% Total Compensation US$5.8m US$4.8m 100%\n\nOn an industry level, around 54% of total compensation represents salary and 46% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that Nu Skin Enterprises allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance. ceo-compensation\n\nA Look at Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.'s Growth Numbers\n\nOver the last three years, Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. has shrunk its earnings per share by 69% per year. It saw its revenue drop 9.4% over the last year.\n\nFew shareholders would be pleased to read that EPS have declined. This is compounded by the fact revenue is actually down on last year. These factors suggest that the business performance wouldn't really justify a high pay packet for the CEO. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..\n\nStory continues\n\nHas Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nWith a total shareholder return of -76% over three years, Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. shareholders would by and large be disappointed. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nGiven that shareholders haven't seen any positive returns on their investment, not to mention the lack of earnings growth, this may suggest that few of them would be willing to award the CEO with a pay rise. At the upcoming AGM, the board will get the chance to explain the steps it plans to take to improve business performance.\n\nCEO compensation is a crucial aspect to keep your eyes on but investors also need to keep their eyes open for other issues related to business performance. We did our research and spotted 1 warning sign for Nu Skin Enterprises that investors should look into moving forward.\n\nArguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels.

        "title": "It Might Not Be A Great Idea To Buy Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) For Its Next Dividend",
        "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Nu Skin Enterprises' shares before the 31st of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of June.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$0.06 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.24 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Nu Skin Enterprises has a trailing yield of approximately 1.8% on its current stock price of US$13.24. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Nu Skin Enterprises can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Nu Skin Enterprises\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Nu Skin Enterprises reported a loss last year, so it's not great to see that it has continued paying a dividend. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Dividends consumed 72% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nWhen earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Nu Skin Enterprises reported a loss last year, and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years, making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Nu Skin Enterprises has seen its dividend decline 15% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. While it's not great that earnings and dividends per share have fallen in recent years, we're encouraged by the fact that management has trimmed the dividend rather than risk over-committing the company in a risky attempt to maintain yields to shareholders.\n\nWe update our analysis on Nu Skin Enterprises every 24 hours, so you can always get the latest insights on its financial health, here.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIs Nu Skin Enterprises an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. On the plus side, the dividend was covered by free cash flow.\" It's not that we think Nu Skin Enterprises is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.\n\nHaving said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Nu Skin Enterprises. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Nu Skin Enterprises and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Even after rising 8.4% this past week, Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS) shareholders are still down 75% over the past three years",
        "content": "Every investor on earth makes bad calls sometimes. But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So spare a thought for the long term shareholders of Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS); the share price is down a whopping 78% in the last three years. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. And over the last year the share price fell 65%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 24% in the last three months. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.\n\nOn a more encouraging note the company has added US$51m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the three-year loss for shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Nu Skin Enterprises\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver the three years that the share price declined, Nu Skin Enterprises' earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Extraordinary items contributed to this situation. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Nu Skin Enterprises' TSR for the last 3 years was -75%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nNu Skin Enterprises shareholders are down 63% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 28%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 11% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Nu Skin Enterprises  you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

        "content": "Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 8, 2024\n\nNu Skin Enterprises, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q1 2024 Nu Skin Enterprise Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Scott Pond, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Pond: Thanks, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. Today on the call with me are Ryan Napierski, President and CEO; and James Thomas, CFO. On today's call, comments will be made that include some forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed or anticipated. Please refer to today's earnings release and our SEC filings for a complete discussion of these risks. Also during the call, certain financial numbers may be discussed that differ from comparable numbers obtained in our financial statements. We believe these non-GAAP numbers assist in comparing period-to-period results in a more consistent manner. Please refer to our investor website for any required reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Napierski: Thanks, Scott. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Having just returned from our top sales leader, alignment and activation, all in event in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, I'm eager to provide an update on the state of our business as we enter our 40-year anniversary, pursuing our mission of being a global force for good by empowering people to look, fill and live better lives. I'll provide a performance summary for Q1 as well as the progress update on our ongoing enterprise transformation vision, strategy and plans. Our results for the first quarter were in line with guidance. At a high level, our business is on track with established expectations, and we are maintaining our full year outlook. Revenue for the quarter was in the middle of our guidance range despite experiencing more FX pressure than we had anticipated.\n\nWe were also pleased with our progress on expense reduction initiatives, which helped us deliver first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share at the high end of our range. Our Rhyz business delivered another strong quarter with revenues up 57% to more than $62 million, led by both our Mavely technology platform and Wasatch manufacturing business. The revenue contribution from Rhyz accounted for approximately 15% of total enterprise revenue in the first quarter, and we continue to expect this segment to account for 20% to 25% of our overall mix by 2025. Looking at the performance of our core Nu Skin business, our new product innovations delivered solid results. Ageloc, Wellspa IO and RenewspA IO, the holistic wellness and beauty devices we launched recently, along with Ageloc Trme, our personalized weight management system that also launched in 2023 contributed approximately $42 million to our Q1 revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nEurope and Africa, there was a very favorable response to Trme during Q1. There were also positive trends in a handful of our Southeast Asia Pacific markets, and we were encouraged by continued improvements in our sales leader trend in Mainland China despite a generally tepid macroeconomic climate. In other regions, we continue to battle macroeconomic challenges, including heavy inflationary pressures on consumer spending for premium goods, which, together with our aggressive price increases from a year ago have hampered our customer and affiliate acquisition efforts. In the Americas region, our subscription business in North America continues to be pressured by these factors, and we're making some adjustments to our model in Latin America to counter macro forces, particularly in Argentina.\n\nIn South Korea, consumer sentiment remains negative due to the housing market crisis, making it difficult to grow with customers and build the channel. Consumer sentiment is also a factor in Japan in addition to significant FX pressure on our results. So to combat these external factors, we are placing more emphasis on product innovation in the affordable luxury space, and we will be introducing several new products at our upcoming West and East live sales conferences in Q3, our first multimarket in-person events since COVID. Despite these headwinds, we remain committed to our long-term enterprise vision of transforming our core Nu Skin business while building out Rhyz in our long-term beauty, wellness and lifestyle ecosystem. As I mentioned earlier, we just returned from our meetings with our top leaders where there was a palpable level of energy and excitement about the future.\n\nWe introduced our next major product innovation, Mind 360 [ph] a new division targeted at the rapidly growing $10 billion cognitive health market. Mind 360 takes a holistic approach to addressing the interrelated factors of stress, sleep and cognitive performance that are impacting the well-being of consumers in today's busy world. We're excited to preview Mind 360 at our upcoming live events in Q3 with planned introductions of Mind 360 to follow towards the end of the year and into 2025. Channel activation within our core Nu Skin business is a top priority for us, and we're pleased to announce the promotion of Justin Keisel as our new President of Global Sales. Justin has been leading the work to expand our affiliate model across the Americas over the past several years.\n\nHe has extensive sales leadership experience, both at Nu Skin and in prior roles and has demonstrated his commitment to our leaders success. Justin is spearheading our efforts to retool our entire global sales organization and bring a much more rigorous lens to the sales performance management and channel activation. To this end, we recently launched a new series of incentives, including a new customer acquisition and leadership performance program to reenergize the field. We anticipate these new initiatives to take root through the remainder of this year. Also, let me quickly give an update on last quarter's announcement of our intent to enter India, one of the fastest-growing direct selling markets in the world. We are taking a very new approach to this high potential emerging market that will enable us to reach a much wider array of customers and entrepreneurs.\n\nOur product offering, business model and operational footprint will be synchronized to enable broader market - mid-market appeal. We are just beginning to activate our channel towards a targeted market opening in 2025 with a digital-first approach that is more agile and will enable us to scale more quickly throughout the market. We see India and our emerging market business model as a gateway to many new markets in the future and anticipate these learnings will help us delve deeper in the second and third-tier markets within Latin America, Southeast Asia and China. Growing out rise in our Rhyz and our Rhyz business is a critical element of our overall enterprise vision as we seek to build out the world's leading beauty, wellness and lifestyle ecosystem. A smiling woman applying a product from the company's skin care line.\n\nOver the past several years, we've constructed essential infrastructure consisting of manufacturing, technology and operations to support Nu Skin's core business while enabling other brands to grow. We are now applying this ecosystem to BeautyBio to enable it to scale and see additional opportunities to extend our comprehensive suite of services, spanning product R&D, production, packaging, cutting-edge technology and logistics to the Indybeauty [ph] and wellness industry for influencers and creators. We see great potential for this influencer incubator over the mid to long term, and we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities as we lean into the disruption of the beauty and wellness industry due to social influencers and Indy brands.\n\nWe are utilizing our capital to invest in additional manufacturing, services, capabilities and opportunities to enable future growth. So in summary, first quarter results were in line with guidance, and we are maintaining our 2024 outlook. From a top line perspective, we are acutely focused on channel activation with new incentives and continue to lean into our product strategy, including the upcoming launch of Mind 360 as well as affordable luxury. We also continue to invest in our Rhyz business to accelerate growth and further transform our enterprise to leverage our competitive advantages within the beauty, wellness and lifestyle industries. Expense prudence remains a critical focus in 2024. And while we made significant progress on these initiatives during the first quarter, there are still opportunities to drive further efficiency, including our SKU optimization plan to eliminate 25% to 30% of our SKUs by the end of 2025.\n\nDespite the challenging conditions in many of our markets in the near to midterm, we remain focused on executing our long-term vision of becoming the world's leading integrated beauty and wellness ecosystem. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James to cover the first quarter results in more detail along with our guidance. James?\n\nJames Thomas: Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining today. I'll provide a brief Q1 update and then speak to Q2 and 2024 guidance. For additional details, please visit our Investor Relations website. For the first quarter, we posted revenue of $417.3 million, which was at the midpoint of our previous guidance range and included a negative foreign currency impact of 3.8% or $18.2 million, which created more pressure from our initial guidance. Reported earnings landed near the top end of our guidance range at negative $0.01 or $0.09, excluding restructuring charges. Our gross margin was 70.5% compared to 72.3% in the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the Nu Skin core business improved 50 basis points to 76.9% compared to 76.4% in the prior year quarter due to our SKU rationalization initiatives and targeted promotion mix.\n\nSelling expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 36.8% and compared to 39.1% in the prior year quarter. For the Nu Skin core business, selling expense was 41.7%, flat with the prior year. The lower overall gross margin and selling expense is due in growth due to growth in our Rhyz segment, which now accounts for 15% of our business. General and administrative expense declined $9.3 million year-over-year and as a percentage of revenue, was 29.9% compared to 27.8%. The increased percentage can be attributed to lower quarterly revenue levels. As previously discussed, we've been strategically evaluating our Nu Skin core business and better aligning our operating costs to be in line with revenue. In the first quarter, we incurred an additional $7.1 million restructuring charge, and we will continue our cost efficiency plan through next quarter with an anticipated $3 million to $8 million of restructuring charges.\n\nWe continue to expect this cost efficiency plan to deliver annual savings of between $40 million and $65 million before taxes. We will continue to seek business efficiencies in all areas and believe these actions will help us maximize cash flows, focus on improved margins and enhanced earnings per share going forward. Our operating margin for the quarter was 2.1% or 3.8% excluding restructuring charges compared to 3.3% or 5.4%, excluding restructuring charges in the prior year. Our interest expense was $7.3 million for the quarter compared to $4.9 million in the prior year. The other income expense line reflects a $0.4 million expense compared to a $3.4 million gain in the prior year quarter. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations rose to a positive $3.3 million, driven by a concentrated effort on inventory management.\n\nIn contrast with the $22.1 million cash outflow in the same period last year. Cash from operations is typically the lowest in the first quarter due to lower revenue levels in what is seasonally our slowest quarter. We paid $3 million in dividends and paid down our outstanding debt, $20 million in the quarter. We did not repurchase any stock and have $162.4 million remaining on the current authorization. Our tax rate for the quarter was 148.4% or 48.5% excluding restructuring charges compared to 22%. For the second quarter, we anticipate an elevated tax rate in the range of 45% to 55% and anticipate a projected 2024 annual tax rate of 25% to 35%. This annual rate reflects an anticipated higher global effective tax rate, primarily due to the expected geographical mix of earnings during the year and the rate impact from our stock awards in Q1.\n\nShifting focus now to guidance. In light of the continued economic pressures, challenges associated with our transforming our business and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates, we are reiterating 2024 revenue in the $1.73 billion to $1.87 billion range. We anticipate earnings per share of $0.77 to $1.16 or adjusted earnings of $0.95 to $1.35. Our guidance now assumes an increased foreign currency headwind of approximately 2% to 3%. We are projecting second quarter revenue of $420 million to $455 million, assuming a foreign currency headwind of approximately 3% to 4% with reported earnings per share of $0.01 to $0.10 or $0.10 to $0.20, excluding restructuring charges. And with that, operator, we'll now open the call up for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chasen Bender with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nSee also Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2024 and\n\n12 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

The company's RISE business segment showed strong performance with a 57% increase in revenue, contributing significantly to the total enterprise revenue. Nu Skin Enterprises Inc (NYSE:NUS) is maintaining its full-year outlook, reflecting confidence in its business strategy and operational execution. Significant progress in expense reduction initiatives helped deliver non-GAAP earnings per share at the high end of the guidance range. New product innovations, particularly in the holistic wellness and beauty devices, contributed approximately $42 million to Q1 revenue, demonstrating effective innovation and market responsiveness.\n\nNegative Points\n\nNu Skin Enterprises Inc (NYSE:NUS) faced increased foreign currency headwinds, which negatively impacted revenue by 3.8% or $18.2 million more than initially anticipated. Macroeconomic challenges, including inflationary pressures, are affecting consumer spending on premium goods, particularly impacting customer and affiliate acquisition efforts in the Americas. Consumer sentiment remains negative in key markets like South Korea and Japan, posing challenges to growth and channel building due to external economic factors. The company's subscription business in North America continues to be pressured by macroeconomic factors, necessitating adjustments to the business model in Latin America to counter these challenges. Despite maintaining the full-year outlook, there are ongoing concerns about the worsening trend in sales leaders, customer count, and affiliate numbers, raising questions about future performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: What's really giving you confidence in the second half improvement, considering the worsening trend in sales leaders, customer count, and affiliate numbers?A: Ryan Napierski, President and CEO, highlighted channel activation plans and incentives aimed at improving these metrics. He mentioned the introduction of new products like Mind 360 and affordable luxury items, which are expected to combat inflationary effects and boost customer and affiliate acquisition. James Thomas, CFO, added that historically, Q3 and Q4 tend to be stronger, and they anticipate this trend will continue, contributing to the expected improvement.\n\nQ: Can you expand on the affordable luxury innovation and how it fits into your price architecture?A: Ryan Napierski explained that the company is focusing on expanding its portfolio to include more affordable luxury products, priced between $10 to $30, to meet consumer demand amidst inflation. These products are designed to maintain high quality while being cost-effective, addressing the essential benefits consumers seek.\n\nQ: What are the biggest areas of cost savings, and how do you plan to reinvest these savings?A: Ryan Napierski mentioned that SKU rationalization is a significant area of cost savings, which will be reinvested in product innovation and growth initiatives, particularly in the RISE business. James Thomas noted that as they work through existing inventory, they expect to see more savings, which will also support new product launches and market expansions.\n\nQ: How is the acquisition of Beauty Bio informing your core business, and what benefits have you realized from this acquisition?A: Ryan Napierski stated that Beauty Bio brings unique IP and insights into omnichannel and influencer-led branding, which are crucial for Nu Skin's growth in the beauty device market and broader beauty and wellness industry. The acquisition is seen as a strategic move to integrate influencer insights and omni-channel strategies into Nu Skin's business model.\n\nQ: Could you provide more details on the Mine 360 product line and how it differs from your existing supplement offerings?A: Ryan Napierski described Mine 360 as a holistic approach to cognitive health, addressing interrelated factors like stress, sleep, and cognitive performance. The product line will include various forms such as supplements, gummies, and drinkables, focusing on sustainability and innovative packaging to minimize environmental impact.\n\nQ: What macro pressures are currently impacting customer and affiliate growth, and how are you addressing these challenges?A: Ryan Napierski acknowledged the impact of inflation on consumer spending but noted the continued strength in their connected device business. He emphasized the strategic focus on affordable luxury and new product innovations like Mine 360 to meet consumer needs effectively despite economic pressures.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) Misses Q1 Revenue Estimates\n\nPersonal care company Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) missed analysts' expectations in Q1 CY2024, with revenue down 13.3% year on year to $417.3 million. Next quarter's revenue guidance of $437.5 million also underwhelmed, coming in 3.7% below analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.09 per share, down from its profit of $0.37 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nu Skin? Find out in our full research report.\n\nNu Skin (NUS) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $417.3 million vs analyst estimates of $432.4 million (3.5% miss) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.09 vs analyst estimates of $0.05 ($0.04 beat) Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $437.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $454.4 million EPS (non-GAAP) Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $0.15 at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $0.35 The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $1.8 billion at the midpoint Gross Margin (GAAP): 70.5%, down from 72.3% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $608.4 million\n\nWith person-to-person marketing and sales rather than selling through retail stores, Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) is a personal care and dietary supplements company that engages in direct selling.\n\nPersonal Care\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nSales Growth\n\nNu Skin carries some recognizable brands and products but is a mid-sized consumer staples company. Its size could bring disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. On the other hand, Nu Skin can still achieve high growth rates because its revenue base is not yet monstrous.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's revenue has declined over the last three years, dropping 11.4% annually. This is among the worst in the consumer staples industry, where demand is typically stable. Nu Skin Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Nu Skin missed Wall Street's estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 13.3% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $417.3 million in revenue. The company is guiding for a 12.5% year-on-year revenue decline next quarter to $437.5 million, a further deceleration from the 10.8% year-on-year decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects revenue to decline 4.1% over the next 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is a key profitability metric for companies because it accounts for all expenses enabling a business to operate smoothly, including marketing and advertising, IT systems, wages, and other administrative costs.\n\nThis quarter, Nu Skin generated an operating profit margin of 2.1%, down 1.2 percentage points year on year. Because Nu Skin's gross margin decreased more than its operating margin, we can infer the company had weaker pricing power and higher raw materials/transportation costs. Nu Skin Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nZooming out, Nu Skin was profitable over the last eight quarters but held back by its large expense base. It's demonstrated subpar profitability for a consumer staples business, producing an average operating margin of 2.9%. On top of that, Nu Skin's margin has slightly declined by 1.4 percentage points on average over the last year. This shows Nu Skin has faced some speed bumps along the way.\n\nKey Takeaways from Nu Skin's Q1 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly Nu Skin blew past analysts' EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its operating margin outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its earnings forecast for next quarter missed analysts' expectations. Overall, the results could have been better. The stock is flat after reporting and currently trades at $12.3 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Nu Skin right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

All statements other than statements of historical fact are \"forward-looking statements\" for purposes of federal and state securities laws and include, but are not limited to, statements of management\u2019s expectations regarding the macro environment and the company\u2019s performance, growth and growth opportunities, shareholder value, productivity, product previews and launches, transformation, evolution, investments, initiatives, digital tools and initiatives, and new market expansion; projections regarding revenue, expenses, margins, tax rates, earnings per share, foreign currency fluctuations, future dividends, uses of cash, financial position and other financial items; statements of belief; and statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nany failure of current or planned initiatives or products to generate interest among the company\u2019s sales force and customers and generate sponsoring and selling activities on a sustained basis; risk that direct selling laws and regulations in any of the company\u2019s markets, including the United States and Mainland China, may be modified, interpreted or enforced in a manner that results in negative changes to the company\u2019s business model or negatively impacts its revenue, sales force or business, including through the interruption of sales activities, loss of licenses, increased scrutiny of sales force actions, imposition of fines, or any other adverse actions or events; economic conditions and events globally; competitive pressures in the company\u2019s markets; risk that epidemics, including COVID-19 and related disruptions, or other crises could negatively impact our business; adverse publicity related to the company\u2019s business, products, industry or any legal actions or complaints by the company\u2019s sales force or others; political, legal, tax and regulatory uncertainties, including trade policies, associated with operating in Mainland China and other international markets; uncertainty regarding meeting restrictions and other government scrutiny in Mainland China, as well as negative media and consumer sentiment in Mainland China on our business operations and results; risk of foreign-currency fluctuations and the currency translation impact on the company\u2019s business associated with these fluctuations; uncertainties regarding the future financial performance of the businesses the company has acquired; risks related to accurately predicting, delivering or maintaining sufficient quantities of products to support planned initiatives or launch strategies, and increased risk of inventory write-offs if the company over-forecasts demand for a product or changes its planned initiatives or launch strategies; regulatory risks associated with the company\u2019s products, which could require the company to modify its claims or inhibit its ability to import or continue selling a product in a market if the product is determined to be a medical device or if the company is unable to register the product in a timely manner under applicable regulatory requirements; and the company\u2019s future tax-planning initiatives, any prospective or retrospective increases in duties or tariffs on the company\u2019s products imported into the company\u2019s markets outside of the United States, and any adverse results of tax audits or unfavorable changes to tax laws in the company\u2019s various markets.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial performance and the forward-looking statements contained herein are further qualified by a detailed discussion of associated risks set forth in the documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

It is calculated by translating the current period\u2019s revenue at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing that amount to the prior-year period\u2019s revenue. The company believes that constant-currency revenue change is useful to investors, lenders and analysts because such information enables them to gauge the impact of foreign-currency fluctuations on the company\u2019s revenue from period to period.\n\nEarnings per share, operating margin and income tax rate, each excluding restructuring and/or impairment charges, also are non-GAAP financial measures. Restructuring and impairment charges are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business. The company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors, lenders and analysts because removing the impact of these charges facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company\u2019s performance. Please see the reconciliations of these items to our earnings per share, operating margin and income tax rate calculated under GAAP, below.\n\nThe following table sets forth revenue for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 for each of our reportable segments (U.S. dollars in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31, Constant-\r\nCurrency 2024 2023 Change Change Nu Skin Americas $ 75,031 $ 101,157 (25.8)% (20.1)% Mainland China 61,067 67,976 (10.2)% (6.1)% Southeast Asia/Pacific 60,065 67,810 (11.4)% (8.1)% Japan 44,236 52,606 (15.9)% (5.6)% Europa & Africa 42,273 47,444 (10.9)% (11.8)% South Korea 40,963 70,324 (41.8)% (39.3)% Hong Kong/Taiwan 30,466 34,548 (11.8)% (9.8)% Nu Skin other 672 (115) 684.3% 684.3% Total Nu Skin 354,773 441,750 (19.7)% (15.6)% Rhyz Investments Manufacturing 50,302 35,767 40.6% 40.6% Rhyz other 12,231 3,945 210.0% 210.0% Total Rhyz Investments 62,533 39,712 57.5% 57.5% Total $ 417,306 $ 481,462 (13.3)% (9.5)%\n\nThe following table provides information concerning the number of Customers, Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders in our core Nu Skin business for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nMarch 31, 2024 2023 Change Customers Americas 199,399 266,378 (25)% Mainland China 162,239 217,101 (25)% Southeast Asia/Pacific 93,411 117,266 (20)% Japan 108,808 115,161 (6)% Europe & Africa 163,481 190,313 (14)% South Korea 100,230 120,907 (17)% Hong Kong/Taiwan 47,693 56,410 (15)% Total Customers 875,261 1,083,536 (19)%\n\nPaid Affiliates Americas 29,081 38,707 (25)% Mainland China 24,405 24,522 \u2014 Southeast Asia/Pacific 29,778 36,431 (18)% Japan(1) 21,679 37,155 (42)% Europe & Africa(1) 18,313 27,654 (34)% South Korea(1) 20,594 40,599 (49)% Hong Kong/Taiwan(1) 10,321 16,286 (37)% Total Paid Affiliates 154,171 221,354 (30)%\n\nSales Leaders Americas 6,616 8,242 (20)% Mainland China 9,600 10,034 (4)% Southeast Asia/Pacific 5,570 6,337 (12)% Japan 6,385 5,688 12% Europe & Africa 3,715 4,524 (18)% South Korea 4,122 6,242 (34)% Hong Kong/Taiwan 2,601 2,688 (3)% Total Sales Leaders 38,609 43,755 (12)%\n\n(1) The March 31, 2024, number is affected by a change in eligibility requirements for receiving certain rewards within our compensation structure.

In all of our markets besides Mainland China, we refer to members of our independent sales force as \"Brand Affiliates\" because their primary role is to promote our brand and products through their personal social networks. \"Sales Leaders\" are the three-month average of our monthly Brand Affiliates, as well as sales employees and independent marketers in Mainland China, who achieved certain qualification requirements as of the end of each month of the quarter.\n\nNU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC.\n\nConsolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\n\n(U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\n\nMarch 31, 2024 2023 Revenue $ 417,306 $ 481,462 Cost of sales 123,242 133,588 Gross profit 294,064 347,874 Operating expenses: Selling expenses 153,542 188,124 General and administrative expenses 124,566 133,899 Restructuring and impairment expenses 7,134 9,787 Total operating expenses 285,242 331,810 Operating income 8,822 16,064 Interest expense 7,325 4,888 Other income (expense), net (396) 3,412 Income before provision for income taxes 1,101 14,588 Provision for income taxes 1,634 3,212 Net (loss) income $ (533) $ 11,376 Net (loss) income per share: Basic $ (0.01) $ 0.23 Diluted $ (0.01) $ 0.23 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (000s): Basic 49,538 49,644 Diluted 49,538 50,058\n\nNU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)\n\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) March 31,\n\n2024 December 31, 2023 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 212,532 $ 256,057 Current investments 8,674 11,759 Accounts receivable, net 67,041 72,879 Inventories, net 265,100 279,978 Prepaid expenses and other 93,913 81,198 Total current assets 647,260 701,871 Property and equipment, net 422,818 432,965 Operating lease right-of-use assets 93,092 90,107 Goodwill 230,768 230,768 Other intangible assets, net 101,933 105,309 Other assets 246,044 245,443 Total assets $ 1,741,915 $ 1,806,463 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 32,237 $ 43,505 Accrued expenses 247,068 260,366 Current portion of long-term debt 30,000 25,000 Total current liabilities 309,305 328,871 Operating lease liabilities 74,198 70,943 Long-term debt 453,183 478,040 Other liabilities 95,023 106,641 Total liabilities 931,709 984,495 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders\u2019 equity: Class A common stock \u2013 500 million shares authorized, $0.001 par value, 90.6 million shares issued 91 91 Additional paid-in capital 618,706 621,853 Treasury stock, at cost \u2013 40.9 million and 41.1 million shares (1,564,942) (1,570,440) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (110,607) (100,006) Retained earnings 1,866,958 1,870,470 Total stockholders\u2019 equity 810,206 821,968 Total liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity $ 1,741,915 $ 1,806,463\n\nNU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC.\r\nReconciliation of Operating Margin Excluding Impact of Restructuring to GAAP Operating Margin (in thousands, except for per share amounts) Three months ended\r\nMarch 31, 2024 2023 Operating Income $ 8,822 $ 16,064 Impact of restructuring and impairment: Restructuring and impairment 7,134 9,787 Adjusted operating income $ 15,956 $ 25,851 Operating margin 2.1% 3.3% Operating margin, excluding restructuring impact 3.8% 5.4% Revenue $ 417,306 $ 481,462\n\nNU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC.\r\nReconciliation of Effective Tax Rate Excluding Impact of Restructuring to GAAP Effective Tax Rate (in thousands, except for per share amounts) Three months ended\r\nMarch 31, 2024 2023 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 1,634 $ 3,212 Impact of restructuring on provision for income taxes 2,356 2,593 Provision for income taxes, excluding impact of restructuring $ 3,990 $ 5,805 Income before provision for income taxes 1,101 14,588 Impact of restructuring and impairment expense: Restructuring and impairment 7,134 9,787 Income before provision for income taxes, excluding impact of restructuring $ 8,235 $ 24,375 Effective tax rate 148.4% 22.0% Effective tax rate, excluding restructuring impact 48.5% 23.8%\n\nNU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC.\r\nReconciliation of Earnings Per Share Excluding Impact of Restructuring to GAAP Earnings Per Share (in thousands, except for per share amounts) Three months ended\r\nMarch 31, 2024 2023 Net (loss) income $ (533) $ 11,376 Impact of restructuring and impairment expense: Restructuring and impairment 7,134 9,787 Tax impact (2,356) (2,593) Adjusted net income $ 4,245 $ 18,570 Diluted earnings per share $ (0.01) $ 0.23 Diluted earnings per share, excluding restructuring impact $ 0.09 $ 0.37 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (000) 49,538 50,058\n\nNU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC.\n\nReconciliation of Earnings Per Share Excluding Impact of Restructuring to GAAP Earnings Per Share Three months ended\r\nJune 30, Year ended\r\nDecember 31, 2024 -

        "content": "Nu Skin (NUS) Q1 Earnings: What To Expect\n\nPersonal care company Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow after market close. Here's what to expect.\n\nNu Skin beat analysts' revenue expectations by 2.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $488.6 million, down 6.5% year on year. It was a weak quarter for the company, with revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts' expectations.\n\nIs Nu Skin a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Nu Skin's revenue to decline 10.2% year on year to $432.4 million, improving from the 20.4% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.05 per share. Nu Skin Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Nu Skin has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Nu Skin's peers in the personal care segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Coty delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 7.5%, meeting analysts' expectations, and USANA reported a revenue decline of 8.3%, in line with consensus estimates. USANA traded up 9.6% following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Coty's results here and USANA's results here.\n\nInvestors in the personal care segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices flat over the last month. Nu Skin is down 2.6% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $14.5 (compared to the current share price of $12.2).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "content": "Q4 Earnings Roundup: Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) And The Rest Of The Personal Care Segment\n\nLet's dig into the relative performance of Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q4 personal care earnings season.\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 4% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 13.4% below consensus. Inflation (despite slowing) has investors prioritizing near-term cash flows, and while some of the personal care stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have not been spared, with share prices declining 6.6% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nNu Skin (NYSE:NUS)\n\nWith person-to-person marketing and sales rather than selling through retail stores, Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) is a personal care and dietary supplements company that engages in direct selling.\n\nNu Skin reported revenues of $488.6 million, down 6.5% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 2.6%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations and underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to work toward our long-term vision of becoming the world\u2019s leading integrated beauty and wellness platform, our progress was impacted by persistent macro-economic pressures and disruptions associated with transforming our business,\u201d said Ryan Napierski, Nu Skin president and CEO.\n\nStory continues Nu Skin Total Revenue\n\nNu Skin delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group.

        "title": "High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Avoid: 3 Dangerous Picks",
        "content": "Dividends that provide a passive source of revenue for investors often seem great on the surface. Stocks with high yields can sometimes indicate a company\u2019s instability or solely serve the purpose of attracting investors without offering sustainable returns.\n\nThe three stocks we\u2019ll introduce in this article have very high dividends but shaky financials and past troubles with cuts. Investors should be aware of the real picture behind the attractive dividend rates that these companies proclaim.\n\nTo better understand these stocks, we\u2019ll detail their long-term performances, any significant changes made to their dividend rates, and relevant financial history.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIcahn Enterprises (IEP) Icahn Enterprises Conglomerate company logo seen displayed on smart phone. IEP stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIcahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) is the company of Carl Icahn, a well-known investor. Despite a history of large payouts, it has seen a lot of scrutiny in its time. Troubles that Icahn Enterprises has faced include a federal investigation for fraud. This is a questionable trend by short-sellers who profit from a stock\u2019s poor performance.\n\nAfter the investigation was announced last May, Icahn Enterprises\u2019 stock price took a significant hit. It dropped from its $50 base to its current\u00a0$17 low. This is still reflected in IEP\u2019s current price.\n\nAs a result of this poor performance, Icahn Enterprises offers a forward yield of 22.90%, a significant cut from its more than 30% yield from a year ago. The negative performance has also attracted the attention of short-sellers who regularly take advantage of the downward trends that affect it.\n\nWith the current state of Icahn Enterprises and its ability to provide investors with promised returns, you should think twice before buying or keeping this stock.\n\nNu Skin Enterprises (NUS) woman smiling with white background\n\nSource: Odua Images via Shutterstock\n\nCurrently, Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS) has a forward yield of 11.77%. But, the company\u2019s financials from the past year indicate payouts are unlikely to be sustainable.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Nu Skin Enterprises has paid out over 130% of its profit yet was still forced to make quarterly dividend cuts. And this year, it is experiencing negative dividend growth. The company is not making more than it is paying. So payouts are unlikely for its current dividend yield.\n\nPart of these cuts come from a year-over-year (YOY) revenue decline of near 6%. Additionally, the company\u2019s layoffs last November were part of a restructuring project. These terminations were a direct result of the company\u2019s poor performance in last year\u2019s Q3.\n\nWith Nu Skin Enterprises\u2019 current low, investors should understand the possibility of further dividend cuts. Think twice before buying NUS simply for the high yield.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nPossibly the largest worldwide telecommunications companies, AT&T (NYSE:T) offers a dividend yield of 6.52%. By comparison, the S&P500 average is 2%. However, AT&T\u2019s Q4 report included a -$0.07 drop in earnings per share YOY.\n\nEven though revenue was up in 2023 YOY, the company continues facing daunting debt of over $150 billion with rising interest rates. High debt is accompanied by the risk that AT&T will not be able to pay the high dividend it promises.\n\nIn addition to lower-than-expected earnings last year, AT&T hasn\u2019t performed in line with the S&P 500 average in total returns. It\u2019s never been an outstanding performer for investors in the past. Therefore, despite promises of high yields, the safety of those dividends should be called into question.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts went under the knife, suggesting analysts have soured majorly on the business.\n\nFollowing the downgrade, the consensus from three analysts covering Nu Skin Enterprises is for revenues of US$1.8b in 2024, implying a discernible 7.9% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months.

Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Nu Skin Enterprises' prospects, administering a measurable cut to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Nu Skin Enterprises  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nIt'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 26% to US$15.50.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. One more thing stood out to us about these estimates, and it's the idea that Nu Skin Enterprises' decline is expected to accelerate, with revenues forecast to fall at an annualised rate of 7.9% to the end of 2024. This tops off a historical decline of 4.2% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for companies in the broader industry, which suggest that revenues (in aggregate) are expected to grow 7.1% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while it does have declining revenues, the analysts also expect Nu Skin Enterprises to suffer worse than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. Given the scope of the downgrades, it would not be a surprise to see the market become more wary of the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven so, the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for the value creation of shareholders. We have estimates - from multiple Nu Skin Enterprises analysts - going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nOf course, seeing company management  invest large sums of money in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are downgrading their estimates. So you may also wish to search this free list of stocks that insiders are buying.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS) Is Reducing Its Dividend To $0.06",
        "content": "Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:NUS) is reducing its dividend from last year's comparable payment to $0.06 on the 6th of March. This means that the annual payment is 1.8% of the current stock price, which is lower than what the rest of the industry is paying.\n\nView our latest analysis for Nu Skin Enterprises\n\nNu Skin Enterprises Is Paying Out More Than It Is Earning\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Before making this announcement, Nu Skin Enterprises' dividend was higher than its profits, but the free cash flows quite comfortably covered it. Generally, we think cash is more important than accounting measures of profit, so with the cash flows easily covering the dividend, we don't think there is much reason to worry.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to grow rapidly. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, we would start to get a bit worried, with the payout ratio possibly reaching 138%. historic-dividend\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.20 total annually to $0.24. Dividend payments have fallen sharply, down 80% over that time. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.\n\nDividend Growth Potential Is Shaky\n\nGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. Over the past five years, it looks as though Nu Skin Enterprises' EPS has declined at around 40% a year. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.\n\nStory continues\n\nNu Skin Enterprises' Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable\n\nOverall, it's not great to see that the dividend has been cut, but this might be explained by the payments being a bit high previously. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Nu Skin Enterprises that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NYSE:NUS) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 14, 2024\n\nNu Skin Enterprises, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Nu Skin Enterprises Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Scott Pond, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Pond: Thanks, Valerie, and good afternoon, everyone. Today on the call with me are Ryan Napierski, President and CEO; and James Thomas, CFO. On today's call comments will be made that include some forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those discussed or anticipated. Please refer to today's earnings release and our SEC filings for a complete discussion of these risks. Also during the call, certain financial numbers may be discussed that differ from comparable numbers obtained in our financial statements. We believe these non-GAAP numbers assist in comparing period-to-period results in a more consistent manner. Please refer to our investor website for any required reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Napierski: Thanks, Scott. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We have a lot to cover in today's call. So let's jump into business performance and then, on to expanded enterprise vision and strategy. We are pleased to deliver fourth quarter revenue above our latest guidance range driven by the continued rollout of ageLOC WellSpa iO in many markets, seasonal promotions in China and the continued strong performance of our Rhyz businesses. This quarter further demonstrated that while we continue to make progress towards our long-term vision, much of our headway was concealed by the persistent macroeconomic pressures impacting consumer spending and customer acquisition around the globe, as well as disruptions associated with the ongoing transformation of our core business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis was particularly evident in the fourth quarter results, which were down in our Americas, South Korea and Europe and Africa segments. This was offset by seasonal promotions in Mainland, China stabilization in Japan and modest growth in our Hong Kong, Taiwan segment. In addition, we achieved over 100% growth in our Rhyz businesses, which accounted for 13% of our revenue in the fourth quarter and continues to become a more meaningful part of our [Technical Difficulty] end users are achieving their desired results with this more personalized approach. WellSpa iO has been a strong addition to our number one beauty device systems brand and is generating consumer interest with demonstrable results. WellSpa iO is scheduled to launch in Mainland China in Q2 and we'll be launching a similar device RenuSpa iO in the U.S. later this quarter.\n\nMoving into 2024, we are preparing to enter the rapidly growing $10 billion brain health market. Stress, sleep and mental acuity are all growing concerns for consumers around the world, and our unique approach to holistic wellness positions us to provide integrated solutions to help our consumers find better balance in their lives. We will be introducing this new division and brand at our live events in Q3. We also continue to focus on deepening connectivity with customers and affiliates through enhanced capabilities and feature sets in the Vera and Stela apps which we believe will enable deeper connections with our customers to meet their personalized needs. Geographically, we continue to see near-term pressures on consumer spending related to extended hyperinflationary conditions around the globe.\n\nThe Americas, South Korea, Europe and Southeast Asia all experienced a more difficult year as consumers shifted purchasing habits towards lower-priced goods and services. In the meantime, we will be introducing new affordable luxury products targeting the masstige customer segments, including a series of new product regimens being rolled out in the U.S. and South Korea this quarter. Together with WellSpa, RenuSpa and our [indiscernible], we anticipate leveling trends in the business moving into the second half of 2024. Mainland China experienced stabilization in our business in the fourth quarter, which was associated with seasonal promotions. While we continue to believe in the potential of this great market, we anticipate ongoing challenges as the economy works to recover over the coming year.\n\nWe are introducing a new go-to-market model, partnering with Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, which will begin being tested and refined in the first half of '24. Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan each showed favorable outcomes in 2023, and we anticipate these trends to continue moving into 2024. Next, let me discuss our expanded enterprise ecosystem vision and strategy, including Rhyz, which is becoming a more substantial part of our business. As consumer discovery and purchasing behavior shift further from traditional media into social media, influencer and affiliate marketing continues to grow at an accelerating pace. A recent statistic study estimates influencer marketing in the U.S. to grow from $6 billion to around $69 billion by 2029. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize upon this shift as we expand our enterprise vision towards becoming the world's leading integrated beauty, wellness and lifestyle ecosystem.\n\nThis implies an even broader opportunity in the mid to long term as we further build out our Rhyz business segments and seek synergistic opportunities across our business units. By applying our nearly 40 years of learnings and affiliate marketing from our core business with new capabilities and learnings from our Rhyz businesses, we see greater potential for driving enterprise value over time via this expansive beauty, wellness and lifestyle ecosystem. In order to further enable this expanded vision, we have been reviewing all aspects of our business and reassessing our approach to capital allocation to invest in long-term growth and business evolution. This includes rebalancing our dividend payout ratio to be more in line with or better than our industry peers.\n\nThis move will provide increased financial flexibility, enabling us to effectively seize forthcoming opportunities. This was a difficult decision for our management team and the Board and one that we don't take lightly. However, after extensive analysis and careful deliberation, we believe this move is in the best interest of all stakeholders as we pursue our long-term enterprise ecosystem vision for growth. This capital reallocation will free up approximately $65 million annually that will be directed towards high potential growth investments, which in the near term will be relatively evenly spread across the following three areas. Number one, accelerating the growth opportunities in our Rhyz ecosystem, which grew 41% last year and is becoming a more substantial portion of the overall enterprise.\n\nNumber two, facilitating a progressive new market expansion model for our core Nu Skin business, beginning with India, anticipated in 2025. And number three, furthering the build-out of our digital first affiliate opportunity platform with an extended technology partnership with Infosys. Given the importance of our updates to strategy and capital allocation, I want to spend a few minutes diving deeper into the areas we are now targeting for stepping up investment. I'll start with Rhyz, which was established back in 2018 as part of our enterprise diversification strategy. Rhyz is a synergistic ecosystem of consumer, technology and manufacturing companies focused on innovation within the beauty, wellness and lifestyle space. These companies synergistically support our core business and/or have capabilities that provide greater growth potential to our expanding ecosystem vision.\n\nRhyz has experienced healthy organic and acquisition led growth and most of the businesses are still very early in their life cycles. In the fourth quarter, Rhyz revenues were up over 100% or 87% excluding last year's BeautyBio acquisition. Rhyz segments accounted for 13% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate this growing to 20% to 25% by 2025. With an increased investment in Rhyz, we plan to increase manufacturing capabilities and capacity to service Nu Skin as well as additional consumer goods and indie brands, expand technology capabilities for Mavely, which is rapidly becoming a leading affiliate brand marketplace and technology provider for our other businesses and develop a creator led indie beauty brand Incubator, including new and acquired brands. A smiling woman applying a product from the company's skin care line.\n\nFor the Incubator, we will be able to leverage the BeautyBio integration and acceleration framework that we developed last year. For the past several years, we've been building the infrastructure necessary to incubate, launch and support creator brands with an array of services, including product R&D, manufacturing and packaging, technology, logistics and internationalization. These additional Rhyz investments will enable us to delve further into the influencer or creator economy and is far reaching opportunities in the beauty, wellness and lifestyle space. We are well positioned to service the creator economy and indie brand markets by leveraging our vast array of resources on our way to becoming the world's leading integrated beauty, wellness and lifestyle ecosystem.\n\nNext, new market expansion, beginning with India. This vibrant country is rapidly becoming the world's fastest growing economy with 1.4 billion people, a growing middle class and the highest per capita digital and mobile adoption, we see India as a market holding great potential for us. Nu Skin has a rich history of international expansion that has fueled our growth into nearly 50 markets around the globe. We plan to reinvent the way we go-to-market with a progressive digital first model, which will enable us to expand our global footprint more quickly and cost effectively accelerating our ability to bring Nu Skin to people around the world who are seeking to look, feel and live better. We will be aligning with our global sales leaders around an anticipated 2025 entry into the strategically important market at our annual team elite trip this April.\n\nAnd third -- our third area of focus is further investment in our digital first affiliate opportunity platform. We aim to provide our brand affiliates with a simpler, faster and easier way to engage in our businesses around the globe. Through our expanded partnership with Infosys, we plan to enhance our digital ecosystem, accelerate our global Equinox rollout and streamline the affiliate journey to minimize friction and accelerate growth. So in summary, 2024 will be another year filled with transformation of our core Nu Skin business to win in the future and further our build-out of the Rhyz ecosystem. Our initial outlook for 2024 reflects further macro challenges in the core lessening throughout the year, partially offset by continued double-digit growth from the Rhyz segments.\n\nThroughout these challenging times, we remain optimistic in our future growth potential as we continue to reposition the enterprise towards becoming the world's leading integrated beauty, wellness and lifestyle ecosystem. And with that, I'll turn the call over to James to dive deeper into our guidance and the financials. James?\n\nJames Thomas: Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining today. I'll provide a brief Q4 and 2023 full year financial review and then, give Q1 and 2024 projections. For additional details, please visit our Investor Relations website. For 2023, we generated revenue of $1.97 billion with a negative foreign currency impact of 3% or $60 million. Earnings per share for the year were $0.17 or $1.85 excluding restructuring and other charges compared to $2.07 or $2.90, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. For the fourth quarter, we posted revenue of $488.6 million which was ahead of our previous guidance range and included a negative foreign currency impact of 1% or $7.2 million. Reported earnings, which also came in slightly ahead of previous guidance were $0.15 or $0.37, excluding restructuring and other charges compared to $1.15 or $0.89, excluding restructuring impairment charges and a favorable tax rate in Q4 2022.\n\nOur gross margin was 72.1% compared to 71.7%. Fourth quarter gross margin for the core Nu Skin business was 77.4% compared to 74.9% in the prior year quarter. The 250 basis point improvement in our core business was primarily driven by the strategic decision to rebalance our product portfolio, reduce product promotions and the intentional focus on higher margin products. Selling expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 37.1% compared to 38.5% in the prior year quarter. The lower selling expense is due in large part to growth in our Rhyz manufacturing segment, which carries a lower selling expense. For the core Nu Skin business, selling expense was 40.8% compared to 40.5%, in line with expectations. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.7% compared to 24.4%.\n\nThe increased percentage can largely be attributed to lower quarterly revenue levels and increased promotional campaign spend in the quarter. As previously discussed, during the fourth quarter, we made the decision to strategically reevaluate our Nu Skin core business and align our operating costs to be in line with revenue. In the fourth quarter, we incurred an initial $10 million charge in severance and made the determination to extend our restructuring and cost efficiency program through Q2 of 2024 with an anticipated additional $15 million of restructuring charges. We expect the cost efficiency program to deliver annual savings of between $40 million and $65 million before taxes in the core Nu Skin operating plan, excluding investments in Rhyz.\n\nWe will continue to seek business efficiencies in all areas and believe these actions will help us maximize cash flows, target improve margins and enhance earnings per share going forward. Operating margin for the quarter was 3.3% or 6.4%, excluding restructuring and other charges compared to 5.3% or 8.8%, excluding restructuring and impairment charges in the prior year. The other income expense line reflects a $6.7 million expense compared to a $3.1 million expense in the prior year quarter. We generated strong cash from operations for the fourth quarter of $54 million compared to $26 million in the prior year period. This was mainly, driven by focused efforts in improving existing inventory levels and tightening our supply chain. We paid $19.3 million in dividends and did not repurchase any stock.\n\nWe have $162.4 million remaining on the current authorization. Our tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% or 24.9% excluding restructuring and impairment charges compared to negative 134.9% or negative 3.7%, excluding restructuring impairment charges in the prior year period. For the first quarter, we anticipate an elevated tax rate in the range of 60% to 70% due to rate impacts from stock awards and anticipate a projected 2024 annual tax rate of 25% to 35%. This annual rate reflects an anticipated higher global effective tax rate primarily due to the expected geographical mix of earnings during the year and the rate impact from our stock awards in Q1. As Ryan mentioned and as part of our long-term transformational goals today, today, we announced an update to our capital allocation strategy, rebalancing the quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share.\n\nWe remain in a strong financial position and will continue to generate healthy cash flow. This dividend change plus our overall payout ratio more in line with or better than our industry peers and will provide approximately $65 million in capital that can be used to fund growth opportunities. This action also enables us to prioritize responsible debt management, actively pursue inorganic growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value through opportunistic share repurchases. Shifting focus now to guidance. Taking into account the aforementioned economic conditions and challenges associated with transforming our business, we are projecting 2024 revenue in the $1.73 billion to $1.87 billion range. We anticipate earnings per share of $0.75 to $1.15 or adjusted earnings of $0.95 to $1.35.\n\nOur guidance assumes a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1% and assumes a higher effective tax rate of 25% to 35%, primarily due to the expected geographic mix of earnings during the year. We are projecting first quarter revenue of $400 million to $435 million, assuming a foreign currency headwind of approximately 3% with reported earnings per share of negative $0.07 to $0.03 and or to $0.00 to $0.10 excluding restructuring charges. In closing, as we realign the company for success by transforming our core Nu Skin business and expand our Rhyz ecosystem, we are structuring ourselves to increase investments in promising high-growth opportunities that will benefit all stakeholders as we implement our comprehensive enterprise vision and strategy.\n\nOur dedication to generating lasting value for the enterprise remains steadfast as we position ourselves for future growth. And with that, operator, we'll now open the call up for questions.\n\nSee also 30 Unhappiest Countries In The World and 35 Biggest Football Clubs in the World.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "content": "Revenue: $1.97 billion in 2023, a decrease of 12% from the previous year. Earnings Per Share (EPS): $0.17, or $1.85 excluding certain charges, down from $2.07 or $2.90 in 2022. Gross Margin: Improved to 72.1% in Q4 2023 from 71.7% in Q4 2022. Operating Margin: 3.3% in Q4 2023, or 6.4% excluding charges, compared to 5.3% or 8.8% in Q4 2022. Dividend: A quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share announced, payable on March 6, 2024. 2024 Outlook: Revenue projected between $1.73 to $1.87 billion, with EPS between $0.75 to $1.15, or $0.95 to $1.35 non-GAAP.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with NUS.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, Nu Skin Enterprises Inc (NYSE:NUS) released its 8-K filing, reporting its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results which slightly surpassed the company's latest guidance. Nu Skin, a global direct-selling company specializing in health and beauty products, faced a challenging year with a 12% decline in annual revenue, attributed in part to a 3% foreign exchange impact.\n\nFinancial Performance and Challenges\n\nNu Skin's revenue for the fourth quarter was $488.6 million, a 6% decrease compared to the same period in the previous year, with foreign exchange impacting revenue by approximately 1%. The company's Rhyz segment, however, saw a significant increase, contributing $65.1 million in revenue, marking a 101% growth. Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter stood at $0.15, or $0.37 excluding restructuring and other charges, a decrease from $1.15, or $0.89 excluding similar charges in the prior year.\n\nThe company's President and CEO, Ryan Napierski, acknowledged the impact of macro-economic pressures and the challenges of transforming the business. Despite setbacks in the Americas, South Korea, and Europe & Africa, there was some offsetting growth in Mainland China, Japan, and the Hong Kong/Taiwan segment. Napierski emphasized the company's commitment to long-term value and its strategy to reposition Nu Skin to succeed in the evolving beauty and wellness industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial Achievements and Industry Importance\n\nNu Skin's gross margin improved to 72.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 71.7% in the same quarter of the previous year. This improvement is particularly significant for a consumer packaged goods company, as it indicates better cost management and the potential for increased profitability. Selling expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased, while general and administrative expenses increased, reflecting the company's ongoing investments in business transformation.\n\nKey Financial Metrics\n\nKey financial metrics for Nu Skin include a decrease in customers by 15% and a 30% reduction in paid affiliates, or 13% when adjusting for changes in eligibility requirements. Sales leaders also saw a 10% decrease. These metrics are crucial as they reflect the direct-selling business model's health and the company's ability to attract and retain sales talent.\n\n\"We are committed to generating long-term enterprise value by repositioning our company to win in the rapidly evolving beauty and wellness industries,\" said Ryan Napierski, Nu Skin president and CEO.\n\nAnalysis of Company Performance\n\nNu Skin's performance in 2023 was a mix of challenges and strategic growth areas. While the overall revenue decline reflects broader economic pressures and the pains of business transformation, the strong growth in the Rhyz segment and improved gross margins suggest areas of resilience and potential for future growth. The company's focus on digital-first affiliate opportunities and planned expansion into new markets like India in 2025 indicate a forward-looking strategy.\n\nThe company's capital allocation priorities have been updated, with a rebalanced dividend payout ratio and a focus on three key investment initiatives. These include accelerating growth in the Rhyz ecosystem, expanding into new markets, and building out a digital-first affiliate opportunity platform.\n\nFor 2024, Nu Skin anticipates continued challenges in the global macro environment but expects improvements throughout the year. The guidance for the year reflects this cautious optimism, with revenue and EPS projections accounting for potential foreign currency impacts and restructuring charges.\n\nNu Skin's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns even as the company navigates through a transformative period.\n\nFor more detailed financial information and to access the webcast of the management team's conference call with the investment community, investors are encouraged to visit the Investor Relations page on Nu Skin's website.\n\nAs Nu Skin Enterprises Inc (NYSE:NUS) continues to adapt to the evolving landscape of the beauty and wellness industries, investors and stakeholders will be watching closely to see how the company's strategic initiatives unfold in the coming year.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Nu Skin Enterprises Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Nu Skin's (NYSE:NUS) Q4 Sales Top Estimates But Stock Drops 12.6%\n\nPersonal care company Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) reported Q4 FY2023 results topping analysts' expectations , with revenue down 6.5% year on year to $488.6 million. On the other hand, next quarter's revenue guidance of $417.5 million was less impressive, coming in 13% below analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.37 per share, down from its profit of $0.89 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nu Skin? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nNu Skin (NUS) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $488.6 million vs analyst estimates of $476.4 million (2.6% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.37 vs analyst estimates of $0.28 (29.9% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 2024 is $417.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $479.7 million EPS (non-GAAP) Guidance for Q1 2024 is $0.05 at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $0.34 Management's revenue guidance for the upcoming financial year 2024 is $1.8 billion at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 10.6% and implying -8.6% growth (vs -11.2% in FY2023) Gross Margin (GAAP): 72.1%, in line with the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $859.2 million\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to work toward our long-term vision of becoming the world\u2019s leading integrated beauty and wellness platform, our progress was impacted by persistent macro-economic pressures and disruptions associated with transforming our business,\u201d said Ryan Napierski, Nu Skin president and CEO.\n\nWith person-to-person marketing and sales rather than selling through retail stores, Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) is a personal care and dietary supplements company that engages in direct selling.\n\nPersonal Care\n\nPersonal care products include lotions, fragrances, shampoos, cosmetics, and nutritional supplements, among others. While these products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. As with other consumer staples categories, personal care brands must exude quality and be priced optimally given the crowded competitive landscape. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales Growth\n\nNu Skin carries some recognizable brands and products but is a mid-sized consumer staples company. Its size could bring disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. On the other hand, Nu Skin can still achieve high growth rates because its revenue base is not yet monstrous.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's revenue has declined over the last three years, dropping 8.6% annually. This is among the worst in the consumer staples industry, where demand is typically stable. Nu Skin Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Nu Skin's revenue fell 6.5% year on year to $488.6 million but beat Wall Street's estimates by 2.6%. The company is guiding for a 13.3% year-on-year revenue decline next quarter to $417.5 million, an improvement from the 20.4% year-on-year decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 2.3% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is a key profitability metric for companies because it accounts for all expenses enabling a business to operate smoothly, including marketing and advertising, IT systems, wages, and other administrative costs.\n\nIn Q4, Nu Skin generated an operating profit margin of 3.3%, down 2 percentage points year on year. Conversely, the company's gross margin actually increased, so we can assume the reduction was driven by operational inefficiencies and a step up in discretionary spending in areas like corporate overhead and advertising. Nu Skin Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nZooming out, Nu Skin was profitable over the last eight quarters but held back by its large expense base. It's demonstrated subpar profitability for a consumer staples business, producing an average operating margin of 3.6%. On top of that, Nu Skin's margin has declined by 2.5 percentage points on average over the last year. This shows the company is heading in the wrong direction, and investors are likely hoping for better results in the future.\n\nKey Takeaways from Nu Skin's Q4 Results\n\nSure, revenue and EPS exceeded Wall Street's expectations this quarter. However, guidance was very bad. Specifically, full-year revenue and EPS guidance missed analysts' expectations by a large amount. Next quarter's guidance was no better, with both revenue and EPS again coming in below expectations. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Nu Skin. The company is down 12.6% on the results and currently trades at $15.21 per share.\n\nNu Skin may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.",

This was offset by seasonal promotions in Mainland China, stabilization in Japan and modest growth in our Hong Kong/Taiwan segment. In addition, we achieved strong growth in our Rhyz businesses, which accounted for 13 percent of our revenue in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"We are committed to generating long-term enterprise value by repositioning our company to win in the rapidly evolving beauty and wellness industries by further transforming our core Nu Skin business and accelerating investment in our rapidly growing Rhyz ecosystem,\" continued Napierski. \"To enhance this transformation, we are reassessing our approach to capital allocation to invest in long-term growth and business evolution. This initiative aims to grant us increased financial flexibility, enabling us to effectively seize forthcoming growth opportunities. This includes rebalancing our dividend payout ratio to be in line with or better than our industry peers. With the additional available capital, we will focus our investments relatively evenly across three key initiatives: 1) accelerating the growth opportunities in Rhyz; 2) facilitating a new market expansion model beginning with India anticipated in 2025; and 3) furthering the build-out of our digital-first affiliate opportunity platform.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are \"forward-looking statements\" for purposes of federal and state securities laws and include, but are not limited to, statements of management\u2019s expectations regarding the macro environment and the company\u2019s performance, growth and growth opportunities, shareholder value, financial flexibility, transformation, evolution, investments, initiatives, digital tools and initiatives, and new market expansion; projections regarding revenue, expenses, tax rates, earnings per share, foreign currency fluctuations, future dividends, uses of cash and other financial items; statements of belief; and statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"aim,\" \"commit,\" \"reposition,\" \"anticipate,\" \"accelerate,\" \"project,\" \"vision,\" \"continue,\" \"outlook,\" \"guidance,\" \"improve,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" the negative of these words and other similar words.\n\nThe forward-looking statements and related assumptions involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any forward-looking statements or views expressed herein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nany failure of current or planned initiatives or products to generate interest among the company\u2019s sales force and customers and generate sponsoring and selling activities on a sustained basis; risk that direct selling laws and regulations in any of the company\u2019s markets, including the United States and Mainland China, may be modified, interpreted or enforced in a manner that results in negative changes to the company\u2019s business model or negatively impacts its revenue, sales force or business, including through the interruption of sales activities, loss of licenses, increased scrutiny of sales force actions, imposition of fines, or any other adverse actions or events; economic conditions and events globally; competitive pressures in the company\u2019s markets; risk that epidemics, including COVID-19 and related disruptions, or other crises could negatively impact our business; adverse publicity related to the company\u2019s business, products, industry or any legal actions or complaints by the company\u2019s sales force or others; political, legal, tax and regulatory uncertainties, including trade policies, associated with operating in Mainland China and other international markets; uncertainty regarding meeting restrictions and other government scrutiny in Mainland China, as well as negative media and consumer sentiment in Mainland China on our business operations and results; risk of foreign-currency fluctuations and the currency translation impact on the company\u2019s business associated with these fluctuations; uncertainties regarding the future financial performance of the businesses the company has acquired; risks related to accurately predicting, delivering or maintaining sufficient quantities of products to support planned initiatives or launch strategies, and increased risk of inventory write-offs if the company over-forecasts demand for a product or changes its planned initiatives or launch strategies; regulatory risks associated with the company\u2019s products, which could require the company to modify its claims or inhibit its ability to import or continue selling a product in a market if the product is determined to be a medical device or if the company is unable to register the product in a timely manner under applicable regulatory requirements; and the company\u2019s future tax-planning initiatives, any prospective or retrospective increases in duties or tariffs on the company\u2019s products imported into the company\u2019s markets outside of the United States, and any adverse results of tax audits or unfavorable changes to tax laws in the company\u2019s various markets.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial performance and the forward-looking statements contained herein are further qualified by a detailed discussion of associated risks set forth in the documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements set forth the company\u2019s beliefs as of the date that such information was first provided, and the company assumes no duty to update the forward-looking statements contained in this release to reflect any change except as required by law.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: Constant-currency revenue change is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company\u2019s performance. It is calculated by translating the current period\u2019s revenue at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing that amount to the prior-year period\u2019s revenue. The company believes that constant-currency revenue change is useful to investors, lenders and analysts because such information enables them to gauge the impact of foreign-currency fluctuations on the company\u2019s revenue from period to period.\n\nEarnings per share, operating margin and income tax rate, each excluding inventory write-off charges, restructuring charges, and/or other charges, also are non-GAAP financial measures. Inventory write-off charges and restructuring charges are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business, and the legal accrual and non-recurring foreign tax charge that have been excluded in the non-GAAP financial measures are not typical for our ongoing operations. The company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors, lenders and analysts because removing the impact of these charges facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company\u2019s performance. Please see the reconciliations of these items to our earnings per share, operating margin and income tax rate calculated under GAAP, below.\n\nThe following table sets forth revenue for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 for each of our reportable segments (U.S. dollars in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, Constant-Currency 2023 2022 Change Change Nu Skin Americas $ 97,753 $ 128,921 (24)% (19)% Mainland China 71,516 73,935 (3)% (2)% Southeast Asia/Pacific 66,889 76,606 (13)% (12)% South Korea 48,380 60,029 (19)% (22)% Japan 50,966 53,877 (5)% (1)% Europe & Africa 47,892 55,337 (13)% (18)% Hong Kong/Taiwan 41,209 39,789 4% 5% Nu Skin other (1,066) 1,525 (170)% (170)% Total Nu Skin 423,539 490,019 (14)% (12)% Rhyz Manufacturing 50,363 29,560 70% 70% Rhyz other 14,738 2,761 434% 434% Total Rhyz 65,101 32,321 101% 101% Total $ 488,640 $ 522,340 (6)% (5)%\n\nThe following table sets forth revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 for each of our reportable segments (U.S. dollars in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, Constant-Currency 2023 2022 Change Change Nu Skin Americas $ 398,222 $ 508,537 (22)% (18)% Mainland China 298,079 360,389 (17)% (13)% Southeast Asia/Pacific 267,206 344,411 (22)% (21)% South Korea 236,099 268,707 (12)% (11)% Japan 207,833 224,896 (8)% (1)% Europe & Africa 192,352 204,275 (6)% (8)% Hong Kong/Taiwan 153,589 157,197 (2)% 1% Nu Skin other -858 3,959 (122)% (122)% Total Nu Skin 1,752,522 2,072,371 (15)% (13)% Rhyz Manufacturing 181,395 149,458 21% 21% Rhyz other 35,214 3,830 819% 819% Total Rhyz 216,609 153,288 41% 41% Total $ 1,969,131 $ 2,225,659 (12)% (9)%\n\nThe following table provides information concerning the number of Customers, Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders in our core Nu Skin business for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change Customers Americas 231,183 299,287 (23)% Mainland China 207,276 202,933 2% Southeast Asia/Pacific 106,471 141,183 (25)% South Korea 103,151 123,749 (17)% Japan 113,670 119,152 (5)% Europe & Africa 163,178 197,917 (18)% Hong Kong/Taiwan 52,110 62,903 (17)% Total Customers 977,039 1,147,124 (15)%\n\nPaid Affiliates Americas 31,910 42,633 (25)% Mainland China 25,889 23,436 10% Southeast Asia/Pacific 34,404 38,653 (11)% South Korea(1) 22,166 45,058 (51)% Japan(1) 22,417 38,021 (41)% Europe & Africa(1) 18,888 31,869 (41)% Hong Kong/Taiwan(1) 11,212 17,286 (35)% Total Paid Affiliates 166,886 236,956 (30)%\n\nSales Leaders Americas 7,126 9,594 (26)% Mainland China 11,296 12,359 (9)% Southeast Asia/Pacific 6,418 6,999 (8)% South Korea 5,249 6,094 (14)% Japan 7,086 5,936 19% Europe & Africa 3,968 4,740 (16)% Hong Kong/Taiwan 2,916 3,015 (3)% Total Sales Leaders 44,059 48,737 (10)%\n\n(1) The December 31, 2023, number is affected by a change in eligibility requirements for receiving certain rewards within our compensation structure.

        "content": "Nu Skin (NUS) Q4 Earnings Report Preview: What To Look For\n\nPersonal care company Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow after market close. Here's what investors should know.\n\nLast quarter Nu Skin reported revenues of $498.8 million, down 7.3% year on year, missing analyst expectations by 4.1%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming earnings guidance for the next quarter.\n\nIs Nu Skin buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Nu Skin's revenue to decline 8.8% year on year to $476.4 million, improvement on the 22.4% year-over-year decrease in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.28 per share. Nu Skin Total Revenue\n\nMajority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings.\u00a0The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Nu Skin's peers in the personal care segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. e.l.f. delivered top-line growth of 84.9% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 13.4% and Coty reported revenues up 13.4% year on year, exceeding estimates by 2.9%. e.l.f. traded up 1.7% on the results, and Coty was down 1.6%.\n\nRead our full analysis of e.l.f.'s results here and Coty's results here.\n\nInvestors in the personal care segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks up on average 1.7% over the last month.

This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "title": "Nu Skin Enterprises' (NYSE:NUS) Returns On Capital Tell Us There Is Reason To Feel Uneasy",
        "content": "If you're looking at a mature business that's past the growth phase, what are some of the underlying trends that pop up? A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well. So after we looked into Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS), the trends above didn't look too great.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Nu Skin Enterprises:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.065 = US$88m \u00f7 (US$1.8b - US$434m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThus, Nu Skin Enterprises has an ROCE of 6.5%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Personal Products industry average of 15%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Nu Skin Enterprises  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Nu Skin Enterprises compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nThere is reason to be cautious about Nu Skin Enterprises, given the returns are trending downwards. About five years ago, returns on capital were 24%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Nu Skin Enterprises becoming one if things continue as they have.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 66% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere.\n\nOn a final note, we found 2 warning signs for Nu Skin Enterprises (1 is a bit unpleasant)  you should be aware of.\n\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this freelist of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 11 best hair care stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our industry background and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at the 5 Best Hair Care Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nWhile hair care products may appear to be a modern phenomenon, their origins trace back thousands of years. Throughout history, humans have utilized various products to enhance their appearance. From homemade remedies to the thriving industry it is today, hair care and cosmetics have evolved significantly over time, reflecting both cultural practices and technological advancements.\n\nThe global hair care and beauty industries have traditionally been considered recession-resistant, as they fall within the consumer staples category, alongside essential items like groceries and cleaning supplies. In addition, given that numerous hair care and beauty brands also qualify as luxury products, the sector operates as a hybrid, blending features of consumer staples and luxury goods to provide the advantages of both. However, the COVID-19 pandemic challenged this perception. Lockdowns and consumer concerns about infection prompted widespread closures of retail and salon stores, resulting in weakened sales across the beauty and personal care product market back in 2022. In response to these challenges, industry leaders were forced to devise strategies to attract more consumers.\n\nIn 2022, the average American consumer spent approximately $86 on hair care products. Among these, shampoo emerged as the most profitable, generating sales of approximately $3.6 billion, followed by hair conditioner and hair coloring, with unit sales reaching 172 million units in the women's hair coloring category. More prevalently, hair growth treatments have gained significant attention in the beauty industry. As more consumers express interest in products that combat hair loss and thinning, the hair growth category has seen a surge in both unit and dollar sales in the United States. In 2022, dollar sales of hair growth products amounted to about $121 million. This category encompasses various product types, including oils such as rosemary oil, as well as more conventional hair care items like shampoo and conditioner, formulated with ingredients aimed at promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe evolving fashion trends and growing awareness of new, safer, and more effective hair care products have fueled a notable surge in their usage, consequently driving growth in the global hair care market. According to a market report by Fortune Business Insights, the global hair care market is forecasted to expand from $99.53 billion in 2023 to $147.49 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% during the forecast period.\n\nInvestors are increasingly turning to shares of hair care companies as a hedge against potential periods of inflation. Some of the top players in the hair care sector that serve as effective choices include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), among others listed below.
