        "title": "Should Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
        "content": "If you're interested in broad exposure to the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 06/28/2017.\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $530.48 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Small Cap Blend\n\nSmall cap companies have market capitalization below $2 billion. They usually have higher potential than large and mid cap companies with stocks but higher risk.\n\nTypically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.\n\nCosts\n\nCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.24%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 19% of the portfolio. Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Jun 24 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYM24) accounts for about 1.31% of total assets, followed by Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) and Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 5.79% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nGSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nThe ETF has added about 10.55% so far this year and it's up approximately 16.42% in the last one year (as of 07/26/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $51.83 and $70.04.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 21.01% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1233 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSSC is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 ETF has $70 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF has $84.71 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Thursday that whoever wins the U.S. presidential election in November will have limited tools to significantly boost domestic oil supply next year.\n\nStrategic petroleum reserve stocks are low and regulatory easing may only significantly boost U.S. long-run supply, the bank said in a client note.\n\nOil prices rose slightly on Friday after the release of U.S. economic data that beat analyst estimates, raising investor expectation for increased crude oil demand from the world's largest energy consumer.\n\nThe Brent crude futures contract for September traded around $82 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September was around $78. [O/R]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoldman Sachs expects Brent prices to range from $75 to $90 in 2025, assuming trend-like growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and steady oil demand as well as market balancing by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and affiliates.\n\n\"While there is a lot of uncertainty about trade policy, tariffs on U.S. crude imports seem unlikely.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs expects oil prices to take a hit of as much as $11 per barrel next year as a result of weaker demand and GDP in a scenario where the U.S. imposes an across-the-board tariff of 10% on goods imports.\n\nHowever, tariffs could impact oil prices by as much as $19 if the Federal Reserve delays interest rate cuts beyond 2025 due to a higher core inflation rate, with Brent at $62 in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to a current forecast of $81, the bank said.\n\n(Reporting by Anjana Anil in Bengaluru; Editing by Sandra Maler and Christopher Cushing)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian currencies are set to weaken if Donald Trump wins office and implements stiff tariffs, making them a target to short as a hedge against his return to the White House, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her I Changed My Mind. The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now. Wall Street Goes Risk-On After US Economic Data: Markets Wrap Markets Tear Up Popular Trades That Reached \u2018Stupid Levels\u2019\n\nThe Chinese yuan, Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht are among the most likely to come under pressure with Trump vowing to crack down on imports from Asia, said Anupam Damani, co-head of emerging-market debt at Goldman\u2019s asset-management division.\n\n\u201cOne of the trades where we think about building resiliency into the portfolio is a long dollar and a short Asia basket,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nThe idea underscores the cautious and selective approach Damani is taking ahead of the November vote in which Trump is vying for a second term. She favors the bonds of countries on the verge of being upgraded to investment grade such as Oman, Serbia, Paraguay and Morocco, while finding value in a few high-yielders, including Ecuador and Angola.\n\nSovereign debt from the developing world is in a much better position compared with Trump\u2019s first term, as countries have built in resilience by improving external accounts and through refinancing agreements, she said.\n\nAmong corporate notes, she likes Mexico\u2019s state-run oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos and cement maker Cemex SAB de CV.\n\nGoldman\u2019s $2.9 billion emerging-market fund has returned about 9.4% over the past year, trouncing the developing world benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Damani, who has nearly 30 years of experience investing in developing markets, joined the firm last year after leaving Nuveen. At Goldman, she helps oversee $43 billion in emerging market-dedicated strategies.\n\nCurrency Hedge\n\nBetting against Asian currencies is a way for investors to hedge for the risks of new and increased tariffs, which Trump has made part of his campaign platform.\n\nHe has floated the idea of tariffs of 10% across-the-board and as high as 60% on Chinese goods, referencing the policies of former President William McKinley, whom he called \u201cthe tariff king.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does two things: Economically, it\u2019s great \u2014 and man, is it good for negotiation,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in a recent interview.\n\nTrump\u2019s policies, which could stoke inflation and keep interest rates elevated for longer, are part of the looming risk for emerging market assets, according to Damani.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman is preparing, she said, by building resilience into its portfolio and keeping capital available to deploy after markets have calmed.\n\n\u201cThe direction of travel is likely to be weaker once we have President Trump come in or right before,\u201d she said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Q2 Result Out: Should You Make a Bet Now?",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, which released its second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 15, 2024, posted a remarkable rebound in its investment banking (IB) business after witnessing a decline in the past two years. Driven by robust performance, the company\u2019s profits jumped 61% in the first six months of 2024.\n\nSince the release of its quarterly results, the stock has moved up nearly 1.5% to $486.70. Year to date, GS has appreciated 27.8% compared with the S&P 500 Index\u2019s growth of 15.1%. In 2023, the stock rose 6.8%.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnical indicators suggest continued strong performance for GS. The stock trades above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling robust upward momentum and price stability. This technical strength underscores positive market sentiment and confidence in the company's financial health and prospects.\n\n50-Day & 200-day Moving Average Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe surge in GS stock has left many investors considering whether they've missed an investment opportunity or still have time to take a position.\n\nWhat\u2019s Aiding GS Stock Growth?\n\nRefocus on its Wall Street operations: Goldman is refocusing on its core strengths of IB and trading operations through restructuring initiatives and opportunistic acquisitions. In 2022, GS acquired NextCapital and Dutch asset manager and NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V., strengthening its capital markets business. These initiatives are likely to boost the company\u2019s presence in overseas markets while scaling back its consumer banking footprint.\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on its Wall Street operations is paying off. In 2022 and 2023, its IB revenues declined by 47.9% and 15.5%, respectively, while in the first half of 2024, the metric soared nearly 27% from the first half of 2023. The upside was driven by the bounce back in global mergers and acquisitions (M&As), which led to a remarkable improvement in the industry-wide deal value and volume.\n\nThe company maintains its long-standing #1 rank in announced and completed M&As and ranked #2 in equity underwriting. A solid financial performance of the corporates, buoyant equity markets and expected rate cuts this year, along with Goldman\u2019s leadership position, lent it an edge over its peers.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s JPM IB business also rebounded. Its total IB fees in the second quarter of 2024 soared 50% year over year. Likewise, Morgan Stanley\u2019s MS IB fees surged 51%.\n\nDuring the second-quarter earnings conference call, top executives noted that the company is still in the early innings of the capital markets and M&A recovery. Though certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, the company remains well-positioned to benefit from a continued resurgence in the capital markets activities.\n\nStory continues\n\nBreaking the Trend with NII Growth: The current high interest rate environment acts as a boon for GS. In second-quarter 2024, the company recorded higher net interest income (NII) than the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, signaled that the central bank is inching closer to cutting interest rates and cited recent inflation readings and the cooling job market as the primary reasons. This will further lower/stabilize funding costs. Thus, Goldman is expected to benefit from such a favorable development.\n\nExpansion in Private Equity Credit Line: The company plans to ramp up its lending services to private equity and asset managers and also intends to expand internationally. This stemmed as a part of its efforts to fill the void left by the turmoil seen at regional banks in 2023 and the collapse of Credit Suisse.\n\nThe private equity market has a strong potential to grow as private equity deals are expected to rise, driven by record-high fundraising. These loans are classified as short-term, typically secured by the assets of the borrowing firms. Hence, these have a lesser risk attached to them. Goldman\u2019s focus on the private equity market is a strategic fit.\n\nGoldman Sachs Asset Management, a unit of GS, intends to expand its private credit portfolio to $300 billion in five years from the current $130 billion. Once the company strengthens its operations in the United States, it plans to expand its lending business into Europe, the U.K. and Asia.\n\nImpressive Capital Distribution: Goldman rewards its shareholders handsomely. Following the 2024 stress test result, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 9% to $3 per share. In the past five years, the company hiked dividends five times with an annualized growth rate of 24.42%. Currently, its payout ratio sits at 35% of earnings.\n\nSimilarly, after clearing this year\u2019s stress test, MS announced a quarterly cash dividend of 92.5 cents, marking an 8.8% hike from the prior payout. JPM announced plans to hike dividends by 8.7% to $1.25.\n\nGS has a share repurchase program in place. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $3.5 billion of shares. Management stated that given the higher-than-expected stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement, the company plans moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter.\n\nIn terms of liquidity position, as of Jun 30, 2024, GS cash and cash equivalents were $206 billion. The company has only $77 billion of near-term borrowings as of the same date.\n\nThe company\u2019s capital position remains strong. Goldman plans to return the excess capital to its shareholders prudently.\n\nAnalysts Shows Mixed Sentiment\n\nOver the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved downward, while 2025 earnings have moved upward.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation Stretched\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Goldman appears somewhat expensive relative to the industry. The company is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 12.44X, above the industry average of 10.08X.\n\nAlthough Goldman's solid fundamentals justify its price, investors may face negative risks if the company's future performance fails to match expectations.\n\nA challenging environment characterized by an economic slowdown, rising costs, and greater SCB standards might stymie GS' growth trajectory.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings (forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill Don\u2019t Rush to Buy GS Stock?\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs achieved milestones with its recent quarterly numbers reaching new highs, caution is warranted for prospective investors. Its efforts to refocus on core capital markets business and expansion in private credit lines provide a solid base for future growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the interest rate cut path, escalating expenses, higher regulatory capital requirements, and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop are expected to influence Goldman\u2019s financial performance greatly.\n\nAlso, GS' stretched valuation relative to the industry raises concerns about sustainability, especially amid economic uncertainties and other challenges. Investors should consider these factors carefully and evaluate their risk tolerance before buying this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Debuts New Batch of Muni Income ETFs",
        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nOn Thursday, Goldman Sachs unveiled a new suite of muni income ETFs with different strategies.\n\nUltra-Short Returns\n\nA short-duration strategy, the Goldman Sachs Ultra Short Municipal Income ETF (GUMI) aims to provide strong current income exempt from regular federal income tax. With a net expense ratio of 0.16%, the fund also aims to mitigate volatility.\n\nThe wide majority of GUMI\u2019s investments target municipal securities with interest that is exempt from federal income tax. In normal conditions, GUMI intents to maintain a half-year portfolio duration, give or take three months.\n\nWest Coast Strategy\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Dynamic Municipal Income ETF (GCAL) offers current income that is exempt from both federal income tax and California personal income tax. This fund has a net expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\nPrincipally, GCAL invests most of its assets toward muni securities from California or other states, territories, and territories of the U.S. A smaller portion of fund assets may be allocated toward junk bonds.\n\nNew York Options\n\nMoving on to the East Coast, the Goldman Sachs Dynamic New York Municipal Income ETF (GMNY) has a net expense ratio of 0.35%. Investors in this fund can benefit from current income that's exempt from New York state and city personal income taxes, along with federal income tax.\n\nGMNY invests in fixed income securities from New York, and other states and territories of the U.S. And similarly to its West Coast peer, GMNY may also add exposure to high yield bond options.\n\nTax-Exempt Income\n\nLastly, the Goldman Sachs Municipal Income ETF (GMUB) looks to provide income that is exempt from federal income tax. This fund has a lower net expense ratio of 0.18%.\n\nGMUB invests primarily in municipal options issued by or on behalf of the United States. The entirety of the fund\u2019s portfolio is intended to be invested in U.S. dollar-denominated securities. However, smaller, separate portions of the fund may be invested in junk bonds or private activity bonds.\n\n\"Advisors are heavily gravitating toward fixed income ETFs right now. And many are seeking the safety and reliability of munis,\u201d noted VettaFi Senior Industry Analyst Kirsten Chang. \u201cThis exciting new suite of products allows Goldman Sachs to tap into decades of experience and expertise to leverage an already-strong muni bond franchise.\"\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit VettaFi | ETF Trends.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\nSPY ETF Quote VOO ETF Quote QQQ ETF Quote VTI ETF Quote JNUG ETF Quote Top 34 Gold ETFs  Top 34 Oil ETFs  Top 57 Financials ETFs\n\nStory continues\n\nToday\u2019s Fixed Income Symposium Will Get You Ahead of the Curve Chelsea Ransom-Cooper Is a Rising Star Qraft Teams With LG AI Research to Offer Pioneering AI-Powered ETF Real Estate ETFs: Performance Perking Up ETF Prime: Crigger on Small-Cap Stocks; Plus, Spot Ether ETFs\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Asset Management is launching four new municipal-bond exchange-traded funds, adding to the $129 billion corner of the state and local government debt market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her I Changed My Mind.

More money managers have seized on demand for ETFs that are often lower-cost than mutual funds. The investment management business of Prudential Financial Inc. also introduced muni ETFs last month.\n\nInflows into muni ETFs in 2024 stand at roughly $5.4 billion, trailing last year\u2019s pace when the funds collected more than $15 billion. However, demand has picked up in June and the products recorded an influx of over $2 billion, the biggest month so far this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nBrendan McCarthy, global head of ETF distribution at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the company wanted to stick with its \u201cDNA\u201d and strong record of actively-managing muni funds.\n\n\u201cThis is a suite of products we want to have on the shelf and our clients are asking for us to have on the shelf,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs has previously launched a passively-run muni ETF that has been slow to gather assets. McCarthy noted that the passive arena is crowded within the municipal market, making it tougher for firms to gain market share.\n\nBlackRock Inc. and the Vanguard Group dominate the passively-run muni ETF space. Just two of their funds account for over half of muni ETF assets overall, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTax Benefit\n\nOne of the new Goldman funds \u2014 the Goldman Sachs Dynamic New York Municipal Income ETF, which will trade on the ticker GMNY \u2013 focusing on tax-exempt debt sold by local governments in New York. Another will center on California borrowers.\n\nDemand for municipal bonds \u2014 which pay tax-exempt interest \u2013 is especially high in New York and California given the high income tax levies in both states.\n\nInvestors are starting to think about the tax efficiency of popular money-market fund holdings, said Scott Diamond, co-head of municipal fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. He said the ultra-short muni ETF, which will trade under ticker GUMI, would appeal to those those buyers given it\u2019s a cash-like product that pays tax-exempt interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are focused on cash, Diamond said. \u201cAn ultra-short vehicle that will have that flexibility to maneuver around in the front end of the tax-exempt market could be really appealing.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Emily Graffeo.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Sold US$38m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "Many The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, John F. Rogers, for US$6.9m worth of shares, at about US$468 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$487, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 13% of John F. Rogers's holding.\n\nInsiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, insiders dumped US$22m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$784m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Goldman Sachs Group is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group you should be aware of.\n\nOf course Goldman Sachs Group may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Is Trending Stock The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +7.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has gained 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $8.38 per share, indicating a change of +53.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.50 points to a change of +59.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $41.17 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Goldman is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.1%. The $51.48 billion and $54.59 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.3% and +6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $12.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. EPS of $8.62 for the same period compares with $3.08 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.04%. The EPS surprise was +1.17%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGoldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Bank Stocks Worth Buying After Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "America\u2019s big banks have reported their second-quarter financial results, and, with a few exceptions, they were extremely strong. Both commercial lenders and investment banks on Wall Street saw their revenues and profits get a lift in Q2 due to a resumption of deal making that includes initial public offerings as well as mergers and acquisitions. Trading activity also surged on Wall Street with markets near record highs.\n\nThe strong Q2 results cap recent good news for the banks. In June, the major lenders successfully passed the annual stress test administered by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Passing that test cleared the way for the banks to raise their dividend payments to shareholders and announce new stock buyback programs, which nearly all of them have done.\n\nWith their share prices marching higher, we look at three bank stocks to buy after earnings in the second quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reported a 41% surge in its Q2 profit due to a rebound in investment banking activity. The Wall Street firm reported earnings per share of $1.82, compared to $1.65, which had been the consensus forecast of analysts. Revenue in the April through June quarter totaled $15.02 billion, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $14.3 billion. Revenue was up 12% from a year earlier.\n\nBeyond investment banking, Morgan Stanley announced strong trading activity and growth in its wealth management unit during the quarter. The bank said its stock trading revenue grew 18% while sales from fixed-income trading increased 16%. Still, investment banking was real standout, where revenues surged 51% to $1.62 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $220 million. MS stock has gained 10% over the last 12 months and looks to have momentum.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) remains the largest bank in the world with $3.4 trillion of assets under management. The lender also reported stellar Q2 financial results driven by a 50% increase in fees earned from its investment banking activities. JPMorgan reported EPS of $4.40, which was ahead of the $4.19 expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $50.99 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.87 billion.\n\nLike Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase attributed the strong results to a rebound in investment banking activity. JPMorgan also benefited from strong stock trading activity during the quarter, with markets at a record high. Other reasons to like JPMorgan stock are its quarterly dividend payment, which the bank just raised to $1.25 a share from $1.15, along with a new $30 billion share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPM stock is up 34% over the last 12 months and trading near an all-time high.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another leading investment bank that reported strong Q2 results that beat Wall Street estimates across the board. The firm announced EPS of $8.62 compared to $8.34 forecast among analysts. The company\u2019s profit was up an impressive 150% from a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter totaled $12.73 billion, beating consensus expectations of $12.46. Sales rose 17% from a year ago.\n\nManagement said the better-than-expected results were due to a rebound in fixed-income trading and strong results in its deal advisory and wealth management operations. Revenue from Goldman\u2019s fixed-income trading rose 17% from a year ago to $3.18 billion. Other highlights included equity trading, which gained 7%, and wealth management, which saw a 27% increase in revenue during the period.\n\nThe latest results mark a turnaround for Goldman Sachs following a dismal 2022 and 2023 when a bear market in stocks and deals dried up on Wall Street. GS stock has risen 36% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Solar Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: July Edition",
        "content": "The Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS) has slumped by more than 40% year-over-year (YOY), illustrating that investors have abandoned solar stocks. However, as an incurable contrarian, I believe the RAYS ETF\u2019s downturn signals a buying opportunity within the solar industry.\n\nWhat\u2019s my premise for the abovementioned claim? Well, the solar industry is forecasted to grow at an annualized rate of 16.04% until 2032, illustrating its systematic support. Furthermore, the solar industry has yet to consolidate, meaning cyclical swings in solar stocks are normal. As such, I believe a \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity has emerged, presenting investors with an opportunity to tap into asymmetrical returns.\n\nConsidering the above, I screened for three best-in-class solar stocks. I applied a robust screening process, emphasizing fundamental aspects, event-driven activities and company valuations. Additionally, I phased in technical analysis wherever necessary.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWithout further delay, let\u2019s examine the three solar stocks worth considering this month.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is a favorite at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), which recently stated that First Solar is set to expand in the U.S. Although the bank\u2019s claim is an isolated observation, it carries gravitas and sets a baseline for further analysis of FSLR stock.\n\nAnother positive about First Solar is its earnings momentum. The company recently reported its first-quarter fiscal results, revealing a revenue beat of $71.9 million and an earnings-per-share beat of 22 cents. Moreover, First Solar reported a 78.3-gigawatt backlog, providing its income statement plenty of runway leading into the tail end of the year.\n\nFurthermore, First Solar\u2019s price multiples seem well-placed. For example, FSLR stock\u2019s price-to-earnings-growth ratio of 0.47x suggests it is a growth-at-a-reasonable price opportunity. Additionally, FSLR stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 6.27x, which I deem grossly undervalued, given the company\u2019s resilient growth trajectory.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly bullish about FSLR stock\u2019s prospects, folks!\n\nJinkoSolar (JKS) The JinkoSolar logo displayed on a plain white wall.\n\nSource: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.com\n\nJinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) has shed more than half its market value in the past year amid a series of systematic headwinds. However, I think the stock has dipped into buying territory. Here\u2019s why.\n\nDespite its recent struggles, JinkSolar\u2019s fundamentals remain robust. For instance, the company recently communicated its first-quarter financial and shipment results, which exceeded my expectations. JKS\u2019s broad-based shipments settled at 21,907 megawatts, up by 51.2% YOY, illustrating a rebound in consumer demand. Moreover, the firm\u2019s first-quarter earnings-per-average-diluted-share beat estimates by $1.04, conveying underestimated efficiencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nCollectively, the aforementioned variables set the tone from a fundamental perspective. However, JKS stock\u2019s financial market-based variables are even more telling. For example, JKS stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of merely 3.07x, indicating absolute value. Additionally, JinkoSolar has a respectable forward dividend yield of 6.9%, which adds a floor to its stock price.\n\nGiven the status of its salient variables, I believe JKS stock is a well-rounded asset with deep value attributes!\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) appeared in a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report earlier this month. The investment banking company touted the stock as a tactical opportunity. Although GS focused on ENPH\u2019s pending July 23 earnings report, the research has a broader application, as it communicated Enhpase\u2019s interim growth.\n\nI included ENPH in the list for numerous reasons. However, my primary reasons pertain to product quality and operating capacity. For example, I enjoy Enphase Energy\u2019s integrated business model, which allows the end user to operate lean inverter systems linked to an application. Moreover, Enphase Energy has installed more than four million systems in approximately 150 countries. This feat proves it has the necessary capacity to smooth its revenue via geographic diversification.\n\nFurthermore, the company has telling financial market-based features. For instance, ENPH stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 8.55x, which is low, considering the firm\u2019s five-year compound AGR of 39.48%. Additionally, ENPH stock trades below its 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages, suggesting a potential mean-reversion is in the offing.\n\nENPH stock is a risky bet. Nevertheless, superior returns are possible!\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Could Be a Great Choice",
        "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\n\nGoldman Sachs in Focus\n\nHeadquartered in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 26.04% so far this year. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $2.75 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.26%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.82% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.56%.\n\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $11 is up 4.8% from last year. In the past five-year period, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 24.42%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 43%. This means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nLooking at this fiscal year, GS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $36.62 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 60.12%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\n\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Are Analysts Bullish on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against the other financial stocks.\n\nThe financial services industry in the US is poised for a dynamic and challenging year ahead, shaped by a confluence of economic, technological, and regulatory factors. The global economy is anticipated to grow modestly, with advanced economies like the US expecting around 1.4% growth. This is influenced by ongoing geopolitical tensions, climate-related disruptions, and persistently high inflation rates. These macroeconomic conditions are expected to significantly impact the operations and profitability of financial institutions. High interest rates have been a double-edged sword for the industry. While they have led to substantial increases in net interest income, particularly for larger banks, they have also driven up funding costs, especially for smaller and regional banks, squeezing their margins. According to Deloitte, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy will be crucial, with expectations that rates will remain elevated initially but may decrease later in the year. This will necessitate careful management of the balance between deposit rates and lending rates to sustain profitability. Economic uncertainty and the potential for slower growth have prompted banks to increase their loan loss provisions as a precautionary measure to cover potential defaults. This trend is expected to persist, reflecting a cautious approach to managing credit risk amidst economic volatility and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nConcurrently, the financial services sector is experiencing significant technological shifts. Advances in AI and generative AI are set to transform various aspects of the industry, from retail investing and fraud detection to insurance offerings. However, these advancements also introduce new risks, such as heightened fraud potential and the need for robust cybersecurity measures. On the regulatory front, changes are becoming more stringent, particularly around climate-related disclosures and sustainability. Financial institutions are required to adapt to these new regulations aimed at enhancing transparency and effectively managing climate risks. These regulatory changes, coupled with technological advancements, are forcing financial institutions to innovate and evolve their business models and strategies. Overall, banks and financial institutions must remain agile and proactive, navigating these multifaceted challenges to maintain profitability and drive growth in 2024. This will involve balancing the benefits and risks of high interest rates, managing loan loss provisions prudently, leveraging technological advancements, and complying with evolving regulatory requirements.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a recent development, major U.S. banks withstood a hypothetical 40% decline in commercial real estate values in the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual health test, which alleviated concerns about the banking sector amid rising interest rates. With increasing risks in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, investors were keenly observing the Fed's stress tests to gauge the exposure of American lenders at a time when pandemic-era work patterns have left office towers largely vacant, pushing vacancy rates to a historic high of 20%. Chris Marinac, head of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, commented, \u201cIn many ways, there should be a sense of relief that banks can endure a severe crisis. However, this doesn\u2019t mean the Fed believes commercial real estate is in the clear. We are still in the early stages of this credit cycle\u201d. The Fed's stress tests evaluate banks' balance sheets against a hypothetical severe economic downturn, including a 36% drop in U.S. home prices, a 55% plunge in equity prices, and an unemployment rate of 10%, reported Reuters.\n\nResults of the stress test released recently showed that banks could continue lending to households and businesses in the event of a severe global recession and indicated the capital needed to be deemed healthy and to determine how much they can return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. The 31 large banks tested demonstrated they had enough capital to absorb nearly $685 billion in losses. This test comes over a year after the collapse of mid-sized lenders like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic, which sparked criticism that the Fed had underestimated banks' vulnerabilities to rising interest rates, previously assuming rates would fall during a severe recession. Commercial office space is a significant concern, with $929 billion of the $4.7 trillion in outstanding commercial mortgages maturing in 2024, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This approaching maturity wall occurs amid declining property values and reduced rental income. Analysts foresee a challenging period for CRE, with banks still having \"considerable concentration risks,\" according to Moody's Ratings. Of the banks tested, Goldman Sachs had the highest projected loan loss for commercial real estate at 15.9%, followed by RBC USA (15.8%), Capital One (14.6%), and Northern Trust (13%). One critique from analysts is that the Fed's stress test did not include regional banks, which hold most of the CRE loans and are less regulated than their larger counterparts.\n\nOver the coming months, senior leaders in the financial services industry anticipate a challenging landscape marked by high interest rates, increased regulatory scrutiny, and persistent inflation concerns. While these trends are familiar to industry veterans, many younger employees have not encountered such conditions before. According to Deloitte, leaders will need to guide their teams through uncertainty, focusing on navigating near-term challenges and identifying potential opportunities. Looking ahead, rapid technological advancements\u2014including generative AI, cloud migration, heightened fraud and cyber risks, and the convergence of industries through embedded finance\u2014will demand unprecedented agility from financial services leaders. Adapting to these changes will require creating new strategic pathways to align with evolving market dynamics. Throughout history, the financial services sector has often driven progress by helping organizations and individuals navigate economic and societal shifts. By the end of this decade, 2024 may be recognized as a pivotal year when the future began to materialize in tangible ways. Investing now in innovative products and services that foster positive outcomes could position firms for sustained competitive advantage in the years ahead.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe leveraged Insider Monkey\u2019s comprehensive database of 920 prominent hedge funds to identify the top 10 financial stocks with the highest level of hedge fund investment as of Q1 2024.

The top-line came in strong led by elevated financing activity and an improvement in advisory revenues, despite weak transaction volumes within the investment banking segment. Should conditions remain conducive, management remains cautiously optimistic the business will experience continued recovery in both capital markets and strategy activity. Meanwhile, GS continues to successfully execute on its strategic initiatives to improve the overall return of the company. It is right sizing headcount and narrowing its ambitions in consumer strategy through divestitures and an enhanced focus on driving profitability in Platform Solutions by 2025. With potential regulatory capital constraints from B3E, GS noted it will reign in buybacks over the short-term but maintain its dividend. Looking ahead, we continue to view the near and long-term outlook for Goldman as attractive at current levels, given favorable business trends, continued positive momentum on strategic initiatives and active expense/capital management programs.\u201d\n\nOverall GS ranks 9th on our list of the best financial stocks to buy.

        "content": "Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Continued The Strong Trend With Their Second Quarter Financials\n\nOn Monday, bank earnings continued with The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), also joining the trend of topped\u00a0profit and revenue estimates on the back of better-than-expected fixed income results and smaller-than-expected loan loss provisions.\u00a0On\u00a0Tuesday, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) boarded the bank earnings train. Morgan Stanley topped profit and revenue estimates with its second quarter financials on the back of\u00a0stronger-than-expected trading and investment banking performance. Bank of America also topped estimates with second-quarter revenue and profit that were fueled by rising investment banking and asset management fees.\n\nGoldman Sachs Justified The High Expectations\n\nOut of the six biggest banks, \u00a0Goldman is the most reliant on investment banking and trading to generate revenue and therefore, expectations were high with the rebound in Wall Street activity.\u00a0\u00a0For the quarter ended on June 30th,\u00a0revenue grew 17% to $12.73 billion on the back of core trading, advisory, as well as asset and wealth management operations, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s $12.46 billion estimate.\u00a0Prrofit surged 150%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$3.04 billion, or $8.62 per share; but last year\u2019s financials were dragged down by hamstrung by write-downs from commercial real estate and the sale of a consumer business.\n\nFixed income was one of the highlights with revenue jumping 17% to $3.18 billion, surassping StreetAccount\u2019s estimate by $220 million, along with the bank\u2019s shrinking exposure to consumer loans as provision for credit losses went down 54% to $282 million, which is quite below StreetAccount\u2019s estimate of $435.4 million.\u00a0On other fronts, Goldman Sachs was mainly in line with estimates. Equities trading rose 7% to $3.17 billion based on strong activity in derivatives.\n\nAsset and wealth management division reported growth of 27% as revenue amounted to $3.88 billion.\u00a0Platform solutions division reported revenue grew 2% to $669 million on the back of rising credit card balances and deposits.\n\nBut the well-known investment banking business disappointed compared to rivals as investment banking fees rose only 21% to $1.73 billion, slightly brlow StreetAccount\u2019s $1.8 billion estimate, with growth behind far behind rivals JPMOrgan Chase and Citigroup who have reported rises exceeding 50%. Goldman Sachs attributed the miss to\u00a0weaker-than-expected advisory fees of $688 million.\n\nMorgan Stanley Benefited From Rebounding Wall Street Activity\n\nFor the quarter ended on June 30th, Morgan Stanley reported revenue grew\u00a012%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$15.02 billion, topping Wall Street\u2019s $14.3 billion estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nWealth management revenue grew 2% to $6.79 billion, which was short of $6.88 billion estimate. Equity trading reported growth of 18% as revenue amounted to $3.02 billion, surpassing the StreetAccount estimate by about $330 million. Fixed income trading revenue grew by 16% to $1.99 billion, topping the Wall Street estimate by $130 million.\u00a0Fueled by rising fixed income underwriting activity, investment banking revenue surged 51% to $1.62 billion, exceeding the estimate by $220 million.\n\nThe bottom line surged 41% YoY as profit amounted to $3.08 billion, or $1.82 per share, helped by a rebound in Wall Street activity..\n\nInterest income plunged 17% YoY to $1.79 billion as the rate environment pushed rich clients to continue shifting cash into higher-yielding assets, resulting in lower deposit levels.\u00a0Earnings amounted to $1.82 a share, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $1.65 a share.\n\nMorgan Stanley investors value the more steady nature of the wealth management business due to its more predictable nature compared to investment banking and trading. However, its usual dynamic got flupped as institutional securities division earn more revenue compared to its wealth management division.\n\nBank Of America Promised A\u00a0NII Rebound\n\nFor the June quarter, Bank of America reported revenue grew less than 1% to $25.54 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $25.22 billion.\u00a0Profit slipped 6.9% YoY to $6.9 billion, or 83 cents a share,\u00a0also topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of 80 cents.\n\nInvestment banking fees rose 29% to $1.56 billion while asset management fees grew 14% to $3.37 billion, and wealth management division reported a 6.3% revenue growth of $5.57 billion.\u00a0Net interest income contracted 3% to $13.86 billion.\n\nBut net interest income fourth quarter guidance of $14.5 billion gave hope of a turnaround this year. Aided by this guidance, shares grew 5.4%.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Betterment to Personalize Strategies for Investors Seeking After-Tax Yield\n\nNEW YORK, July 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Betterment and\u00a0Goldman Sachs Asset Management are excited to announce the launch of the Goldman Sachs Tax-Smart Bonds portfolio. This industry-first portfolio leverages Goldman Sachs' expertise in bond markets and Betterment's automation. The portfolio seeks to generate after-tax yield. Betterment\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Tax-Smart Bonds portfolio is designed for Betterment clients in higher tax brackets, who want to access a tax-smart bond strategy which is potentially lower risk than equity investing. While high-interest cash savings products can be beneficial for shorter-term needs, taxes can reduce yields over time. This new portfolio offers short-duration bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with holdings that Betterment will personalize for its customers based on their tax situation.\n\nBy combining short-duration US Treasury bonds, high-quality corporate bonds and municipal bond ETFs, Goldman Sachs designed this innovative strategy to marry longer-term trends with current bond market conditions, rather than maintaining static allocations over time. This approach can adjust the strategy for events that might create volatility such as the COVID-19 pandemic and US debt ceiling debates. The portfolio strategy considers market conditions and taxable equivalent yields monthly, and Betterment may make adjustments, based on individual tax brackets, as appropriate. Betterment then personalizes portfolio allocations for its clients' individual tax situations to seek to generate higher after-tax yield.\n\n\"We are thrilled to collaborate with Goldman Sachs to bring an innovative bond portfolio to Betterment customers,\" said Sarah Levy, CEO of Betterment. \"We continue to work tirelessly to provide investment products that support our customers in their long-term wealth-building journey.\"\n\n\"It is important for investors seeking to create and safeguard long-term wealth to consider after-tax returns in their portfolios,\" said Padideh Raphael, Global Head of Third Party Wealth at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"This latest collaboration, combining Goldman Sachs's investment capabilities with Betterment's innovative technology platform and customer-first approach, will allow us to work together on behalf of clients who seek attractive after-tax bond yields.\"\n\nFor more information about the Goldman Sachs Tax-Smart Bonds portfolio, please visit\u00a0Betterment's website.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout Betterment Betterment LLC (\"Betterment\") is the largest independent digital financial advisor, using automated technology powered by human expertise to fulfill a singular mission: making people's lives better.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year",
        "content": "The board of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $3.00 on the 27th of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 2.4% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGoldman Sachs Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings\n\nUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Goldman Sachs Group is quite easily earning enough to cover the dividend, however it is being let down by weak cash flows. With the company not bringing in any cash, paying out to shareholders is bound to become difficult at some point.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 27.2%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 34% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range. historic-dividend\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $2.00 total annually to $12.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 20% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Goldman Sachs Group has been growing its earnings per share at 5.2% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Goldman Sachs Group's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\n\nOur Thoughts On Goldman Sachs Group's Dividend\n\nOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Goldman Sachs Group will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We don't think Goldman Sachs Group is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

        "title": "Should Goldman Sachs MarketBeta U.S. 1000 Equity ETF (GUSA) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
        "content": "Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, the Goldman Sachs MarketBeta U.S. 1000 Equity ETF (GUSA) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 04/05/2022.\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $1.73 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.\n\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\n\nCosts\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.11%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.20%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 6.32% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 30.98% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nGUSA seeks to match the performance of the SOLACTIVE GBS US 1000 INDEX before fees and expenses. The Solactive GBS United States 1000 Index measures the performance of equity securities of large and mid-capitalization equity issuers covering approximately the largest 1,000 of the free-float market capitalization in the United States.\n\nThe ETF has gained about 17.14% so far this year and is up about 24.32% in the last one year (as of 07/18/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $35.52 and $48.82.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 17.83% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1013 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs MarketBeta U.S. 1000 Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GUSA is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $504.65 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $556.35 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs and Blackstone analyst was sentenced to 28 months in prison on Wednesday for insider trading, after admitting that his conduct was \"catastrophically stupid.\"\n\nAnthony Viggiano, 27, of Baldwin, New York, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan, after pleading guilty in January to securities fraud.\n\nViggiano was accused of passing tips on eight planned corporate mergers and partnerships between 2021 and 2023 to college friend Stephen Forlano and construction sales representative Christopher Salamone, a childhood neighbor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProsecutors said the scheme resulted in more than $400,000 of illegal profits for Salamone and Forlano, both of whom have also pleaded guilty, with Viggiano receiving $35,000 from Salamone in a bag of cash.\n\nForlano passed some tips to a U.S. Army captain he was friends with, prosecutors added.\n\nThe eight transactions included American International Group's sale of part of a business to Blackstone, and the purchase of satellite operator Maxar Technologies by private equity firm Advent International, a Goldman client.\n\nProsecutors had sought 30 months in prison, calling Viggiano \"far more financially sophsticated\" than his friends and \"the most culpable.\"\n\nViggiano's lawyers sought one year in prison, saying the case involved not \"staggering greed\" but \"seemingly overgrown frat boys.\"\n\nThey also said Viggiano hopes to reenlist in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he served in 2019 before fracturing his hip.\n\nIn a letter to the judge, Viggiano said he believed his actions would help his friends address financial hardships, but that in hindsight \"this was a catastrophically stupid decision.\"\n\nViggiano's lawyer Steven Brill said in a statement after his client's sentencing: \"His inherent values and work ethic will lead him back to the right path.\"\n\nForlano was sentenced to 13 months in prison in May. Salamone's sentencing is on Aug. 20. The Army captain was not criminally charged.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

        "content": "Bank results come in mixed, economic headwinds persist, but for how much longer?\n\nWe are off to the races for the second-quarter earnings season now that all six big banks have reported decent, albeit mixed, results. The banks aren't necessarily a bellwether for things to come during the earnings season; they underperformed the broader market in the second quarter (the KBW Nasdaq Index advanced only 0.80% during the quarter versus growth of 4.10% for the S&P 500 Index), but they do tend to set the tone for the season.\n\nComing into the second-quarter season, Financials were one of the lagging sectors, with banks (Regional and Diversified) in particular being responsible for low year-over-year earnings growth.[1] And while all the banks that have reported thus far have surpassed Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom line, according to FactSet data, there are still headwinds at play that have some banking executives remaining cautious.\n\nFor JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), despite reporting record profits due to higher investment banking fees, it was a surprising increase in loan loss provisions - to $3.05 billion vs. expectations of $2.78 billion - that offset otherwise decent second-quarter results.[2] Increasing loan loss provisions to such an extent suggests that the bank is expecting more loan defaults in the future as the U.S. consumer continues to soften. There were also comments from CEO Jamie Dimon that erred on the side of uncertainty. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown, Dimon said. There has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world.[3]\n\nWells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) results reflect another one of banking's big headwinds for 2024, decreasing net interest income (NII). As interest rates stay higher for longer, banks have seen narrowing in the gap between what it makes in interest and what it pays out for deposits as customers demand higher payouts. In the case of WFC, NII dropped 9% YoY.[4] Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also saw NII slip 3% year over year, however they guided for a rebound in the metric by the fourth quarter in anticipation of interest rate cuts, causing investors to take the stock higher by 4% following today's before-the-bell report.[5]\n\nOn the investment banking front, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) did not quite capitalize on the momentum in IPOs and M&A as expected. Investment banking fees only increased 21% compared to JPMorgan's and Citigroup's (NYSE:C) 50%-plus increases.[6] But what they didn't gain in investment banking fees, they offset with their decreasing exposure to consumer loans which allowed the bank to cut their credit loss provisions by 54% YoY.[7] Its largest peer in the investment banking space, Morgan Stanley (MS), was able to grow investment banking fees by 51% YoY, but similar to WFC and BAC reported NII that plummeted 17% YoY due to lower deposit levels.[8]\n\nStory continues\n\nA presidential election, inflation and the Fed\n\nWhile banking earnings helped to keep market momentum going, there's a lot that has overshadowed that in the last 72 hours. Mainly the unsuccessful assassination attempt on former President Trump. Investors lifted markets yesterday as they believed that event would boost the Republican's campaign for the White House, which has been gaining momentum since President Biden's poor performance in last month's debate. Many on Wall Street are betting that if Trump returns to office, that would usher in a new era of tax cuts, higher tariffs and looser regulations, among other things. Of course, lower corporate taxes would mean a boost for companies' bottom lines.\n\nAdd to that, reassuring comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of Washington D.C. on Monday that the central bank would not wait until inflation was down to 2% to cut rates. The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you've probably waited too long, because the tightening that you're doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%, Powell said.[9] According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, the expectation is that the September Fed meeting will bring the first interest rate cut since 2020.[10]\n\nCEO uncertainty remains high\n\nAfter falling to its lowest level in its nine years in the first quarter of 2024, the Late Earnings Report Index, our proprietary measure of CEO uncertainty, is back up for the second quarter in a row for the third quarter.\n\nThe LERI tracks outlier earnings date changes among publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of $250 million and higher. The LERI has a baseline reading of 100, anything above that indicates companies are feeling uncertain about their current and short-term prospects. A LERI reading under 100 suggests companies feel they have a pretty good crystal ball for the near-term.\n\nThe official pre-peak season LERI reading for the second quarter (data collected in the third quarter) stands at 161, well above the baseline reading, suggesting companies are feeling less certain about economic conditions than they were at the beginning of the year. Some of that uncertainty was evident in banking commentary (see Jamie Dimon's remarks above). As of July 12, there were 66 late outliers and 37 early outliers. 2nd-Quarter Earnings Season Kicks Off With Mixed Bank Results\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOn deck this week\n\nThis week will continue on with more results from the financials sector, mainly regional and diversified banks. We'll also get a read on the consumer when names within consumer finance such as American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS) report, as well as United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). 2nd-Quarter Earnings Season Kicks Off With Mixed Bank Results\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 16, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,445 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 53% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data. 2nd-Quarter Earnings Season Kicks Off With Mixed Bank Results\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\n1 FactSet Earnings Insight, FactSet, John Butters, July 12, 2024, https://advantage.factset.com2 JPMorgan Chase & Co., 2Q24 Earnings Press Release, July 12, 2024. https://www.jpmorganchase.com3 JPMorgan Chase & Co., 2Q24 Earnings Press Release, July 12, 2024. https://www.jpmorganchase.com4 JPMorgan Chase & Co., 2Q24 Earnings Press Release, July 12, 2024. https://www.jpmorganchase.com5 Bank of America, 2Q24 Earnings Press Release, July 16. 2024. https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.netf 6 Goldman Sachs, Secohttps://www.goldmansachs.com7 Goldman Sachs, Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Release, July 15. https://www.goldmansachs.com8 Morgan Stanley Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results, July 16. https://www.morganstanley.com9 CNBC, Powell indicates Fed won't wait until inflation is down to 2% before cutting rates, July 15, 2024. https://www.cnbc.com10 CME Group FedWatch Tool, July 16, 2024, ?https://www.cmegroup.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy at an All-Time Low in July (or 52-Week Low)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence might be one of the strongest trades in the market right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all AI companies are equal. On the contrary, many AI stocks are deep in the red this year, with some trading near 52-week lows currently.\n\nMost of the worst-performing AI stocks are start-up companies that have made their market debuts since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020 and remain unprofitable. Many of these AI stocks also trade at high multiples, raising concerns about their valuation relative to future earnings forecasts.\n\nFor investors with an appetite for risk and a long time horizon, the current situation presents an opportunity to buy these beaten down AI stocks on the cheap and eventually ride them to big gains as they recover. Here are three AI stocks to buy at a 52-week low.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai (AI) Robot hand touching fingertips with human hand through a screen. represents ai and machine learning stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe\u2019ll start with C3.ai (NYSE:AI), the company whose ticker symbol is literally \u201cAI.\u201d After enjoying an initial pop when the AI market took off in 2023, the stock of C3.ai has struggled in recent months.\n\nAI stock is down 22% in the last 12 months and has declined 75% since its initial public offering in September 2020. A lack of profitability at the start-up company appears to be the main reason behind the share\u2019s slump.\n\nDespite the lack of profits, some good things appear to be happening at C3.ai and now could be a good time to take a position with the stock near its 52-week low. A developer of custom AI software that can optimize supply chains and detect financial fraud, C3.ai has managed to grow its sales for five consecutive quarters.\n\nAlso, the company\u2019s customer agreements grew 52% year-over-year in its most recent quarter.\n\nIf C3.ai can keep growing its revenue, it might not be long before the company turns a profit.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is another beaten down AI stock, having fallen about 27% this year and 43% since its September 2020 IPO.\n\nHowever, decent earnings in recent quarters have led analysts to reevaluate SNOW stock. Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently added Snowflake to its \u201cAmericas Conviction List.\u201d Goldman made the move as its analysts see a turnaround coming for Snowflake stock, which is also trading near a 52-week low.\n\nA cloud-based data storage and analytics company named after its founders love of winter sports, Snowflake increasingly employs AI technology to enhance its offerings to customers. The company most recently reported EPS of 14 cents on sales of $828.7 million. Analysts had forecast EPS of 18 cents on sales of $787 million. Snowflake\u2019s guidance of $807.5 million was also above analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $793 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the earnings and guidance from Snowflake have been good, the stock\u2019s valuation has become a concern on Wall Street. SNOW stock is currently trading at more than 150 times the EPS the company is expected to achieve in the next 12 months. The company could still make for a strong long-term AI investment.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor an AI stock that is currently trading right near its 52-week low, we have UiPath (NYSE:PATH). The company\u2019s share price has nearly been cut in half this year, as the maker of automation software that\u2019s infused with AI has announced a string of bad news. That news cycle includes disappointing financial results, a CEO departure and cutting 10% of its workforce, all of which has been done under the guise of a broad restructuring.\n\nMost recently, PATH stock dropped 7% on news the company is cutting 420 jobs. The layoffs come as UiPath struggles with decelerating revenue growth following its IPO in 2021. Since its market debut, PATH stock has fallen 83%.\n\nIn May of this year, UiPath announced that its CEO Rob Enslin was stepping down and would be replaced by company co-founder Daniel Dines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Selling Bonds as Investors Pile Into Bank Debt",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley became the latest big Wall Street bank to tap the US investment-grade market Wednesday after reporting earnings, as strong investor demand helps lenders borrow at lower yields than would have been possible at the start of the month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Curbs in Chip Crackdown on China BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting HSBC Names Elhedery CEO, Picking Insider for Top Job Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business\n\nThe lender is selling the debt in as many as four parts, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The longest portion of the offering, an 11-year security, may yield around 1.4 percentage point above Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.\n\nProceeds from the offering will be used for general purposes and Morgan Stanley is the sole underwriter of the deal, added the person. A representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\n\nThe sale comes a day after the bank\u2019s trading business posted the biggest increase among its peers in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley, like its rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., beat expectations, solidifying the markets business as a hot spot across the industry.\n\nJPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman have raised a combined $16.5 billion after reporting second-quarter earnings. Wednesday\u2019s deal by Morgan Stanley is expected to turbocharge volume from the six biggest banks past the 10-year July average of roughly $17 billion.\n\nBlue-chip bond yields have fallen to the lowest in five months as Federal Reserve officials step up signals that they are moving closer to cutting interest rates. The average US high-grade yield-to-worst, a measure of borrowing costs, hit 5.21% on Tuesday, the lowest since Feb. 6.\n\nFalling yields and strong investor demand have created an attractive playing field for the big banks. Goldman\u2019s $5.5 billion, two-tranche deal on Tuesday garnered $23 billion in peak investor demand, wrote Bloomberg\u2019s Brian Smith.\n\nThat enabled Goldman to tighten pricing 28 basis points on both tranches, offering investors just 2 basis points to 3 basis point in new issue premium, or the extra yield that high-grade borrowers have to offer to sell new investment-grade debt, wrote Smith.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s $2 billion perpetual securities offering, the first preferred stock series by one of the so-called Big Six lenders in the US in almost two months, received more than $8 billion in orders, according to Smith. That enabled the bank to tighten pricing an eye-popping 52.5 basis points from the initial price talk.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more in the IG ANALYSIS: Goldman, Wells Achieve Attractive Funding Levels\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks That Just Raised Their Payouts: July 2024",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are a powerful multiplier. Not only do investors benefit from capital appreciation from the stock but their portfolios are supercharged by the dividend payments increasing total returns.\n\nThe best dividend stocks to buy are those that consistently grow the payout. It\u2019s not a one-and-done situation. They raise their payout year after year, compounding and amplifying the effects. It\u2019s like turbo boosting your portfolio\u2019s growth engine.\n\nIt is why investors love Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings. These are companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 years and 50 years, respectively.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, there are other stocks that have solid track records of raising their payouts though just not as long \u2014 yet. These dividend growth stocks reward investors through share price increases and rising dividend payouts. Many bolster shareholder returns further by buying back stock.\n\nThe following dividend stocks just hiked their payouts and represent some of the best dividend stocks to buy today.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrocery store giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) recently announced it was raising its payout by 10%. The dividend will grow to $1.28 per share from $1.16 per share. It marks the 18th consecutive annual increase in the payout, which has grown by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.5% since the dividend was reinstated in 2006.\n\nKroger is the largest pure-play supermarket stock with over 2,700 stores. It is in the middle of trying to acquire the Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) chain of supermarkets, though it is being opposed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on antitrust concerns. The regulatory agency is suing the companies to block the merger. Together, the two supermarkets would have around 5,000 stores.\n\nTo get around the objections, Kroger and Albertsons have agreed to boost the number of stores they will divest to 579, up from 413. They will sell the locations to C&S Wholesale Grocers, the largest wholesale grocery supply company in the U.S. and the owner of grocery store chains including Piggly Wiggly and Grand Union.\n\nEven if the acquisition fails, Kroger represents a good dividend stock to buy. The stock trades at 11 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its sales. Wall Street expects earnings to triple over the next five years, from a 2.4% CAGR over the last half decade to 8%.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou can tell it was a good year for financial stocks as numerous banks and investment banking firms were hiking their dividends. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was one of the best, hiking its payout by 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther big banking concerns like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all followed suit with increases around 8% or so. One of the disappointments, though, was U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), which only raised its dividend 2%. As that is less than inflation, investors are actually receiving less money than they previously did.\n\nGoldman Sachs is trying to correct the errors of its past ways. Having expanded into consumer-facing finance, it found the business yielded poor returns. The investment banking giant ended up closing down and selling off many of those business. It wants to now just focus on its investment banking, trading and investment management operations.\n\nWith analysts forecasting long-term earnings growth of twice the rate it previously did, Goldman Sachs stock is trading at a significant discount. With a 12-year history of raising its payout and a 7.8% CAGR for the past year, the reformed investment bank is a dividend stock worth buying.\n\nJefferies Financial Group (JEF) A photo of a hand holding a smartphone showing the Jefferies logo while in the background, a monitor shows the Jefferies website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider/ShutterStock.com\n\nIn that same financial services vein is Jefferies Financial Group (NYSE:JEF). But it hiked its dividend by a rather large 16.7%. That should be no surprise to investors. The investment banking firm has increased the payout at a 19% CAGR while over the last five years raised it 22% annually.\n\nJEF earns significant fees from capital markets activities, underwriting, financial advisory and asset management services. It generated $1.7 billion in second-quarter revenues, up 60% year-over-year (YOY). Over the first half of 2024, they are up 46%, indicating just how active the deal-making market has been.\n\nInvestment bank and capital markets in particular have seen robust growth with revenue 29% higher this year. Its asset management business had de minimis revenues last year but it generated $430 million from it through the first two quarters of this year.\n\nWith corporate merger and acquisition activity set to grow 20% in 2024, according to EY-Parthenon, look for Jefferies Financial Group to gain a good portion of that work that will flow to its bottom line.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) olive garden (dri) sign on front of building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse is the next dividend stock that generously raised its dividend. Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) increased the payout 6.9% to $1.40 per share from $1.31 per share.\n\nFiscal 2024 revenue grew 3.5% to almost $3 billion with Olive Garden rising less than 1%, LongHorn Steakhouse up over 7% and its fine dining chains like Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse, Eddie V\u2019s, Seasons 52 and Capital Grille was up 55%. That is distorted a bit because Darden acquired Ruth\u2019s Chris in June 2023. Absent the chain\u2019s inclusion, DRI\u2019s total sales increased 8.6% on a 1.6% rise in same store sales.\n\nDarden Restaurants has paid a dividend every year since 1995 and has steadily increased it every year since 2015. However, during the pandemic when restaurants were forced to close, it did cut the payout. But beginning in 2021 it resumed its regular payments and continued its policy of raising the dividend.\n\nAssuming no global health calamity strikes again, Darden Restaurants is a dividend stock worth buying.\n\nCitigroup (C) A Citibank (C) sign hangs on a Citibank office in Hong Kong. Citigroup layoffs\n\nSource: TungCheung / Shutterstock.com\n\nYet another financial stock was rushing to boost its payout. This time Citigroup (NYSE:C) raised its dividend by 5.7%. The bank is another turnaround play in the financial sector. So far it is successfully exceeding its targets.\n\nJust-reported second-quarter results beat analyst revenue and earnings expectations. Revenue of $20.14 billion was ahead of Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $20.07 billion while earnings of $1.52 per share easily topped estimates of $1.39 per share. Citigroup also benefited strongly from the rebound in Wall Street activity. The bank\u2019s investment banking revenue rocketed 60% higher to $853 million.\n\nYet, Citigroup is still\u00a0a work in progress. Only last week, The Federal Reserve rebuked the bank for making insufficient progress on data and risk management. It was fined $60 million. But, it did pass the Fed\u2019s annual stress test, and its required capital buffer was lowered to 4.1% from 4.3%. Citigroup\u2019s common equity Tier 1 ratio, or CET1, capital ratio is 12.1%, which is 13.5% above the regulatory minimums.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s improved financial picture allowed the bank to raise its dividend from 53 cents to 56 cents per share.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeavy equipment maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a rock-solid dividend stock that just increased its payout by 11 cents to $1.41 per share, which is an 8% hike. Also, the company added $20 billion to its stock buyback program, giving it a total of $21.8 billion to repurchase shares. And, CAT said it continues to use virtually all the free cash flow produced by its primary operations for dividends and buybacks.\n\nCaterpillar is a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its payout for 30 consecutive years. Impressively, it\u2019s made a payment every year since going public in 1933.\n\nShares are up 13% in 2024 and 32% over the past year, yet the stock has historically been cyclical. You don\u2019t want to buy a cyclical stock at peak earnings because a downturn will inevitably follow. But that could be changing for Caterpillar.\n\nBecause its heavy equipment is increasingly used to build alternative energy infrastructure, mine metals needed for electric vehicles and provide equipment for generating electricity used by EVs, Caterpillar\u2019s cyclicality may diminish over time. However, it currently still relies upon more traditional mining and construction activity so it should greatly benefit from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed in 2021. There remains a long tailwind of growth that will push Caterpillar higher.\n\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) graphic of the phrase ETF sitting on a computer in front of an increasing line graph on top of a bar graph.

Its dividend was raised by a whopping 35%, from 61 cents per share to 82 cents per share. However, some caveats come with that.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s dividends aren\u2019t static but change every quarter. They can also decline, though such instances are rare.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF was created in 2011 with the purpose of tracking the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. As a result, it has a strong record of dividend growth with payouts expanding by a compound annual rate of 10.5% for the past decade.\n\nAs the premiere dividend growth stock to own, its top three holdings are Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) Released Earnings Last Week And Analysts Lifted Their Price Target To US$493",
        "content": "A week ago, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) came out with a strong set of quarterly numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock. The company beat expectations with revenues of US$13b arriving 2.9% ahead of forecasts. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) were US$8.62, 2.4% ahead of estimates. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Goldman Sachs Group's 19 analysts is for revenues of US$51.2b in 2024. This would reflect a modest 4.6% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 17% to US$36.32. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$50.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$36.48 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nWith the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 5.7% to US$493. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Goldman Sachs Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$571 and the most bearish at US$373 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Goldman Sachs Group shareholders.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 9.4% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.2% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.6% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Goldman Sachs Group is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Goldman Sachs Group. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have forecasts for Goldman Sachs Group going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nHowever, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- UK inflation held steady at the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target for a second straight month in June, but stubborn price pressures in the services sector added to doubts over whether the central bank will cut interest rates next month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting Amazon Sold a Used Diaper.

Economists had expected a reading of 1.9%.\n\nServices inflation \u2014 which the central bank is watching more closely for signs of domestic price pressures \u2014 also held at 5.7%, which is higher than the BOE predicted in its last forecasts.\n\nBOE officials, notably Chief Economist Huw Pill, have expressed concern about lingering inflationary forces in the labor market and services sector. A tight labor market and the large increase in the minimum wage are still forcing companies to pay more to attract staff. Companies especially in the restaurant and pub businesses have been able to pass on higher prices to their customers.\n\nThis month\u2019s figures will help shape debate at the BOE on when to lower the benchmark lending rate, which officials left at a 16-year high for almost a year in order to curtail price pressures. Pill and others have signaled they want to see more concrete evidence that price pressures are subsiding before loosening policy.\n\nTraders are betting on a roughly 43% chance of a reduction at its next meeting on Aug. 1 with any vote for a loosening expected to be closely run.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Asante Berko was extradited to New York from the UK to face federal charges that he orchestrated bribes to Ghanaian officials while employed at the investment bank.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business Xi Jinping\u2019s Great Economic Rewiring Is Cushioning China\u2019s Slowdown Trump Classified Documents Case Dismissed by Florida Judge\n\nBerko arrived in New York Monday night and is expected to make an initial court appearance on Tuesday, said John Marzulli, a spokesman for Brooklyn US Attorney Breon Peace.\n\nBerko\u2019s extradition comes four years after the onetime Goldman vice president was charged in a 2020 indictment filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York. They accused him of conspiring with at least two officials of the West African nation and four others in a bribery scheme they say benefited Goldman, himself and a Turkish energy company that sought to build a power plant in Ghana.\n\nBerko has been in British custody since since his 2022 arrest at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. In May his lawyers argued that a court order to extradite him should be dismissed, contending the charges weren\u2019t extradition offenses and that most of the alleged acts took place in London, but they failed to stop his transfer.\n\nPay to Play\n\nBerko was a member of the Goldman team responsible for securing and managing financing for the power plant project, according to the indictment. The US alleges that Berko paid bribes to obtain approvals for the Turkish company, in which Goldman held a 16% stake. Prosecutors also claim he laundered the bribe money through US financial institutions.\n\nBoyd Johnson, a lawyer for Berko, didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment on the extradition.\n\nGoldman, which wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing in the matter, has been entangled in foreign bribery cases before, most famously the looting of Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB. In that case, it agreed to pay more than $5 billion, including a $2.3 billion fine in the US, and its Malaysia unit entered a guilty plea, a first for the firm. It was the largest penalty in US history for a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nBerko was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 over the same basic alleged conduct. He resolved that lawsuit by agreeing to pay more than $329,000 to regulators without admittting or denying the allegations, court records show.\n\nStory continues\n\nHidden From Goldman\n\nAccording to the SEC, Berko was a vice president in Goldman\u2019s natural resources group before he resigned in December 2016. He went on to serve as managing director of Ghana\u2019s state-owned Tema Oil Refinery Ltd. but stepped down after the SEC suit was filed.\n\nUS authorities say Berko hid the alleged scheme from Goldman\u2019s compliance department. The bank has said it cooperated fully with the SEC\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe case is US v. Berko, 20-cr-0238, US District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The longest portion of the offering, an 11-year security, may yield around 1.45 percentage point above Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.\n\nProceeds from offering will be used for general corporate purposes and Goldman is the sole underwriter of the deal, added the person.\n\nGoldman\u2019s trading unit powered a surge in earnings in the second quarter. Both fixed-income and equity traders outpaced analysts\u2019 estimates, while a rebounding capital-markets business helped drive better-than-expected results across much of the company\u2019s Wall Street operations.\n\nWells Fargo, meanwhile, is tapping the US high-grade market a day after it raised \u20ac2.75 billion ($3 billion) in the European debt market.\n\nJPMorgan kicked off the issuance spree from the big banks on Monday, borrowing $9 billion in a four-part offering that garnered over $28 billion in investor demand. The longest portion of the deal, an 11-year tranche, drew upwards of $12 billion in orders. That allowed the lender to pay just low single-digit concessions to sell the debt, Bloomberg\u2019s Brian Smith wrote in a note.\n\nThe top banks are expected to borrow more than they usually do after they post earnings as they take advantage of falling yields and get ahead of upcoming US elections that could potentially bring market turmoil. JPMorgan credit analyst Kabir Caprihan expects $21 billion to $24 billion of issuance from the six biggest domestic banks, more than the 10-year July average of roughly $17 billion.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Second-quarter profits at Bank of America (BAC) fell 7% from a year ago as its consumer operations wrestled with higher interest rates, but it was able to churn out more investment banking fees and trading revenue.\n\nThe divergence between the businesses at Bank of America that serve Main Street and Wall Street reinforced a dominant trend this earnings season for the nation\u2019s biggest financial institutions.\n\nHigher interest rates and elevated deposit costs are eating away at more traditional consumer banking margins, forcing giant banks to lean more heavily on their trading and investment banking as dealmaking shows new signs of life.\n\n\"The strength and earnings power of our leading consumer banking business is complemented by the growth and profitability of our global Markets, global banking, and wealth management businesses,\" said Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBank of America\u2019s net income fell to $6.89 billion, which was slightly better than expectations, while rising 3% from the first quarter. Its total revenue of $25.37 billion rose slightly from a year ago.\n\nA key measure of lending revenue known as net interest income fell more than 3% from a year ago and more than 2% from the previous quarter, to $13.70 billion.\n\nThis margin \u2014 which measures the difference a bank earns by making loans and paying out depositors \u2014 has been tightening at many big banks due to higher rates and elevated funding costs.\n\nThis same measure also fell sequentially at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) as their customers continued migrating to higher-yielding deposit products like CDs.\n\nThere were other signs of challenges for Bank of America and its consumer borrowers. It set aside more money for future loan losses when compared with a year ago, a sign that it expects credit conditions to worsen.\n\nIts credit-card charge offs more than doubled from a year earlier and more than 6% from the last quarter, another signal that more of its customers are having trouble paying down their bills.\n\nBut there were some bright spots. Bank of America expects net interest income to rise later this year as the Federal Reserve starts to lower interest rates and the bank replaces under-earning bonds and fixed rate loans with higher-yielding assets.\n\nIt said it expected fourth quarter net interest income to be $600 million higher than its second quarter figure.\n\nAnd its Wall Street operations really stood out. Investment banking fees jumped 28% from a year ago while its equities trading rose nearly 20%.\n\n\"The fundamental trends have been strong capital markets and weak net interest income,\" Portales Partners founder Charlie Peabody told Yahoo Finance Monday, referring to the trends of bank earnings season thus far.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The question is if that spread income is going to reflect positively in the second half of the year.\"\n\nInvestment banking fees and trading revenue also jumped at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.\n\nBank of America's stock rose more than 2% in pre-market trading Tuesday. As of Monday night it was up 20% so far this year.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

Talks are ongoing and the fund\u2019s final size hasn\u2019t been decided yet, they said.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to expand our presence in Saudi Arabia across divisions,\u201d Fadi Abuali, co-chief executive officer of the firm\u2019s Middle East and North Africa business, said in a statement. A spokesperson declined to give further details on the fund.\n\nWith the move, Goldman joins a raft of rivals across the industry in raising Middle East-focused funds. That marks a shift for the giants of the asset management industry, who\u2019ve long flocked to the region to court sovereign wealth funds and raise money that they would then use to invest around the world.\n\nNow, under pressure from the sovereign funds, they\u2019re increasingly looking to raise that same money and deploy it within the region.\n\nNew from Bloomberg: Get the Mideast Money newsletter, a weekly look at the intersection of wealth and power in the region.\n\nBrookfield Asset Management Ltd., for instance, has explored raising separate pools of capital to invest in the Middle East, while Investcorp Holdings, the region\u2019s biggest alternative asset manager, has announced it will set up a $1 billion investment vehicle backed by Beijing\u2019s sovereign wealth fund that is meant to invest in companies across the Persian Gulf as well as China. BlackRock Inc. is seeking to invest in the Middle East, backed by $5 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nHabib Saikaly is joining Goldman as head of the bank\u2019s fundamental equity business across the Middle East and North Africa and is expected to oversee the fund\u2019s development, people familiar with the matter said. A 13-year veteran of JPMorgan, Saikaly will report to Basak Yavuz and Hiren Dasani, the co-heads of Goldman\u2019s emerging market equity division, for the new role, the people said.\n\nGoldman\u2019s fresh push in the Middle East comes only months after becoming the first Wall Street bank to secure a license in Saudi Arabia to set up its regional headquarters there. Other major banks are also stepping up efforts to expand in the kingdom which is in the middle of an ambitious economic reform program.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates With Goldman\u2019s response in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

I want to begin by addressing the horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump. We are grateful that he is safe. I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed and severely injured.\r\nIt is a sad moment for our country. There's no place in our politics for violence. I urge people to come together and to treat one another with respect, civility, dignity, especially when we disagree. We cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society.\r\nTurning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. We delivered strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset wealth management. I am pleased with our performance where we produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the first half of the year.\r\nWe continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments. Global banking and markets, we maintained our long-standing number one rank in announced and completed M&A and ranked number two in equity underwriting.\r\nOur investment banking backlog is up significantly this quarter. From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of a capital markets and M&A recovery. And while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well-positioned to benefit from a continued resurgence in activity. We saw solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FICC and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients' risk intermediation and financing needs.\r\nWe continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share. And we have improved our standing to be in the top three with 118 of our top 150 clients. In asset wealth management, we are growing more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter.\r\nOur assets under supervision hit a record of $2.9 trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. We delivered a 23% margin for the first half of the year and are making progress on improving the return profile of AWM.\r\nIn alternatives, we raised $36 billion year to date. We completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter, including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies and approximately $10 billion across real estate investing strategies.\r\nGiven the stronger than anticipated fundraising in the first half of the year as well as our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year. This is a testament to our investment performance track record and intense focus on client experience. We are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset wealth management platform.\r\nLet me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there's a high level of geopolitical instability. Elections across the globe could have significant implications for forward policies and inflation has proven to be stickier than many had anticipated.\r\nOn the other hand, the environment in the US remains relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near all-time highs.\r\nI am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. Recently, our Board of Directors spent a week in Silicon Valley where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the cutting-edge of technology and AI.\r\nWe all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the accelerating innovations and technology more broadly. The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it significant demand related infrastructure and financing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad franchise.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Dennis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our recent stress test results, the year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests.\r\nGiven this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the increase in requirements, we remain very well-positioned to serve our clients and we'll continue to be nimble with our capital.\r\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase in our repurchase activity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the first quarter. We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, which underscores our confidence in the durability of our franchise.\r\nSince the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend current level of $3 a share. I'd also like to reflect on the significant milestone we hit the second quarter, our 25th anniversary as a public company.\r\nWe went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the firm and it's been an eventful 25 years. Since then. We have persevered through a number of significant global events, including through the dot-com bubble, Nasdaq crash, September 11, a financial crisis, and the pandemic.\r\nWhen I look back at how we overcame these challenges, I immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stay true to our core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence, maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people.\r\nIn closing, I am very confident about the state of our client franchise. We are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths, effectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment. Now let me turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail.\n\nStory continues\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nThank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page 1 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.62, an ROE of 10.9%, and an ROTE of 11.6%.\r\nNow turning to performance by segment, starting on page 4. Global banking and markets produced revenues of $8.2 billion in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Advisory revenues of $688 million were up 7% versus the prior year period.\r\nEquity underwriting revenues rose 25% year over year to $423 million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen. Low volumes remain well below longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 39% to $622 million amid strong leveraged finance activity. We are seeing a material increase in client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity.\r\nOur backlog rose significantly quarter on quarter, driven by both advisory and debt underwriting. FICC net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year over year. Intermediation results rose on better performance in rates and currencies. FICC financing revenues were $850 million, a near record and up 37% year over year.\r\nEquities net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 7% year on year as higher intermediation results were helped by better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues were $1.4 billion, down modestly from a record performance last year, but up 5% sequentially.\r\nTaken together, financing revenues were a record $2.2 billion for the second quarter and a record $4.4 billion for the first half of the year. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both FICC and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base.\r\nI'm moving to asset wealth management on page 5. Revenues of $3.9 billion were up 27% year over year. As David mentioned, our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.2 billion.\r\nManagement and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.5 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues rose 4% sequentially to $707 million.\r\nOur premier ultra-high-net-worth wealth management franchise has roughly $1.5 trillion in client assets. This business has been a key contributor to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite of alternative products, a great example of the power of this unique platform.\r\nWe expect continued momentum in this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint. Our pre-tax margin for the first half was 23%, demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and approaching our mid-20s medium-term target.\r\nNow moving to page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $2.9 trillion, supported by $31 billion of long-term net inflows, largely from our OCIO business, representing our 26th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows.\r\nTurning to page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $314 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $548 million in management and other fees. Gross third party fundraising was $22 billion for the quarter and $36 billion for the first half of the year. In the second quarter, we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $2.2 billion to $12.6 billion.\r\nOn page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $2.2 billion in the quarter, up sequentially from an increase in higher yielding assets and a shift towards non-interest bearing liabilities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $282 million, primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by a release of roughly $115 million related to our wholesale portfolio.\r\nTurning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio of net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion and included approximately $100 million of CIE impairments. Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2024 was 21.6%. For the full year, we continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 22%.\r\nNext capital on slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock dividends of $929 million and common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion. Given our higher than expected SCB requirements, we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter.\r\nWe will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise, while targeting a prudent buffer above our new requirement. Our Board also approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $3 per share beginning in the third quarter, a reflection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and our confidence in the increasing durability of our franchise.\r\nIn conclusion, we generated solid returns for the first half of 2024, which reflects the strength of our interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy. We made strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams, including record first half revenues across FICC and equities financing, management and other fees, and private banking in lending, we remain confident in our ability to drive strong returns for shareholders, while continuing to support our clients. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Glenn Schorr, Evercore.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nHi there. Thanks very much. So I liked your forward-leaning comments on the IB fee pipeline. And I think I heard you say the demand for committed acquisition financing is high. Does that infer anything about us being any closer to an inflection point in private equity related M&A, sponsor-related M&A? And then how much of an event do you think you have as being maybe the only big bank that has a full-on private credit platform, and obviously, DCM platform, and lending platform? Thank you.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure. Good morning, Glenn, and thanks for the question. We're forward leaning on our comments because we definitely see momentum pickup. But I just again want to highlight something that was definitely my part of the script. But I think Denis amplified, which we're still despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are still significantly below 10-year averages.\r\nAnd so for example, I think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages on M&A. One of the reasons that M&A activity -- one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why M&A activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. And so I think, especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025, kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity.\r\nWe're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors. And obviously, it's been way, way below the overall M&A activity has kind of another 20% to get to high 10-year averages, but sponsor has been running below that, and we're starting to see that increase.\r\nNow as that increases, I just think the firm is incredibly well-positioned, given the breadth of both our leading position. We've been top kind of one, two, three, and what I'll call leveraged finance activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community, but we combine it with a very, very powerful direct lending private credit platform.\r\nAnd so I just think we're in a very, very interesting position. The size and the scope of the companies that are out there, that have to be refinanced, recapitalized, sold, changed hands, the sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds, you know, to their limited partners, I think bodes well over the course of the next three to five years. Different environments, but the general trend will be more activity than we've seen in the last 2, 2.5 years.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nI appreciate that. Maybe one quickie follow-up on, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, in your printed prepared remarks, that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter? Can you talk about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during the quarter? Thanks.\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure, Glenn. It's Dennis. I think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity investment line is that in the prior year period, we actually had significant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet. And the results that reflect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. So that is, I think, a large explain of the delta.\n\nOperator\n\nEbrahim Poonawala, Bank of America.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHey, good morning. I just wanted to spend some time on capital, post the SCB increase, one, maybe just from a business standpoint. If you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the firm has been leaning into the financing business. Do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as usual? So one, how does it impact the business?\r\nAnd second, Denis, your comments on buybacks moderating, should we think more like 1Q levels of buybacks going forward? Thanks.\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure, Ebrahim. So a couple of comments. I guess first important to observe that the level of capital that we're operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent where we've been over the last several years. So we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter, which at 90 basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range, we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise.\r\nAnd with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up significantly, there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition financing as David was referencing, or ongoing support of our clients across the financing businesses. We have the capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders.\r\nGiven the $3.5 billion number in the second quarter, we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases, but we still do have capital flexibility. And based on what we see developed from the client franchise, we will make that assessment, we'll manage our capital to an appropriate buffer, but we're still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nGot it. So assume no change in terms of how we're thinking about the financing business. And just separately in terms of sponsor-led activity, we waited all year for things to pick up. Is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are not able to monetize assets? Does it speak to inflated valuations that they're carrying these assets on? Just would love any context there, David if you could. Thank you.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure. I mean, I appreciate that. I don't think it's troubling. I wouldn't use the word troubling. But I do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. At the same point, there's pressure from LPs to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds.\r\nAnd as they take that optionality to wait, the pressure just builds. And so I think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the evaluation parameters, and move forward. But I just think this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity for sure. I'm just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly, but we are going to go back to more normalized levels.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nBetsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nHi, good morning. All right. Well, thanks very much. I did just want to lean in on one question regarding how you're managing the expense line as we're going through this environment because we've had this very nice pickup in revenues and comp ratio is going up a little bit, but I'm just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year? Or is this just a one-off given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure, Betsy. So if you look at year-to-date change in our reviews net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the year-to-date change in our compensation and benefit expense. We are sort of following the same protocol that we always do, which is making our best estimate for what you know we expect to pay for on a full-year basis and doing that in a manner that reflects the performance of the firm as well as the overall competitive market for talent. So based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nOkay. And as we anticipate a continued pick up here in M&A, given everything you mentioned earlier, I would think that, that's positive operating leverage that should be coming your way. Would you agree with that or do I have something wrong there? Thanks.\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nNo, so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog. And we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nBrennan Hawken, UBS.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged, Denis, the record financing revenue, which clearly shows momentum behind the business. And it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable for quite some time now, it seems to reflect balance growth. So one, I want to confirm that that's fair? And could you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate cuts might be on the horizon?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure. Thank you, Brennan. So we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking and markets. We have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure set up in place. We have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products.\r\nThe business is very diversified by sub-asset class, and it's a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. We've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns. That's something that we're going to remain mindful of. But we believe, given the breadth of that franchise, that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nOkay. And then next question is really sort of a follow-on from Betsy's line of questioning. So year-to-date you've got a 64% efficiency ratio. You know, when we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric and an environment -- consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily, you know, how should we be thinking about margins on incremental revenue? You know, could you help us understand how revenue growth will continue to drive improvement in that efficiency ratio?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure. So thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. Obviously, our year-to-date efficiency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. Still not at our target of 60%, but we are making progress. As we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better and better efficiency.\r\nBut ultimately, the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor. But we do have visibility, for example, as we continue to move out of some of our CIE exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that.\r\nAnd we do have a very granular process internally, looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efficiencies over time, while we at the same time look to drive top-line revenues.\n\nOperator\n\nMike Mayo, Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nHi. I'm just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target. I mean, you highlight revenue growth in global banking markets and wealth and asset management. You have record financing for equities and FICC combined. You're number one in M&A. You have record management fees. You have record assets under supervision.\r\nYour efficiency has gone from 74% to 64%, increased your dividend by 9% to signal your confidence, your CET1 ratios, 90 basis points above even the higher Fed requirements. David, you started off the call saying the results are solid, but then you look at the returns and you say 11% ROE in the second quarter, that's not quite the 15% where you wanted to be. So where's the disconnect from what you're generating in terms of returns and where you'd like to be? Thanks.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nYeah, thanks Mike. Appreciate the question. Look, we're on a journey. And, you know, the way I look at it, our returns for the first-half of the year at 12.8%. There are, you know, I think there are a couple of things gets in that. One, for sure, we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through, and so that will come out. And at some point as we work through that, over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that for the returns in the first-half of the year would be a little higher exit.\r\nAnd then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in terms of investment banking activity. And I think that'll come back. I obviously can't predict. But if you look at the returns of the firm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the firm. And we're going to continue to focus on that.\r\nNow the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in AWM. So you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking and markets, but we've said the AWM ROE is not where it needs to be. You heard our comments about the fact that we've got the margin up to 23%, but the ROE is still around 10%.\r\nWe think we can continue to grow the business. As we've said, high-single-digits, we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that AWM ROE. And then you look across the firm and you have a stronger return profile. So I think we're making good progress. We didn't say and have not work to do for sure. But we feel good about the progress.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnd I assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier effect when mergers really kick in. Can you just describe what that multiplier effect could potentially look like based on past cycles?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nWhat I would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is a return to average levels. I'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10-year averages, but there's obviously, if we did get back to that period, and there will be some point in the future where we run above average too, and not just below average, we have a tailwind for that.\r\nBut as a general matter, when there are more M&A transactions, whether with financial sponsors or big corporates, there is more financing attached to that. People need to raise capital to finance those transactions. They need to reposition balance sheets. They need to manage risks through structured transactions. And so there's a multiplier effect as those activities increase. We don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the M&A side.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnd then lastly, for your returns, the denominator is a big factor. So how does that work with the Fed? I know you can't say too much and reasonable people can disagree, but your whole point is that you've de-risked the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the Fed saying that maybe you haven't done so. So how does this process work from here? Will we hear results about the SCB ahead, or is this something that's just behind closed doors?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nLook, as a general matter, what I'd say, Mike, as a general matter, we're supporters of stress testing. We believe it's an important component of the Fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system.\r\nHowever, we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. The stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. It lacks transparency. It contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buffer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difficult for us and all of our peers. We don't believe that the results reflect the significant changes we've made in our business. They're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year over year.\r\nNow, despite all that, you know, we've got the capital flexibility to serve our clients. We'll continue to work with that capital flexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. But obviously we have more work to do, given this result.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nSteven Chubak, Wolfe Research.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nHi, Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question. Just want to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. They were down only modestly despite the absence of the Green Sky contribution. Just wanted to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping off point as we look at the next quarter?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSo, Steve, thank you for the question. I mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the Green Sky contribution. There actually is growth across the card portfolio. I think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nUnderstood and maybe just one more clarifying question. I know there's been a lot asked about the SCB. Really just wanted to better understand, Denis, since you noted that you're running with 90 bps of cushion, which is actually above normal.\r\nJust how you're handicapping the additional uncertainty related to Basel III Endgame. There's certainly been some favorable momentum as per the press reports and even some public comments from regulators? But just want to better understand, given the uncertainty around both the SCB and Basel III Endgame, where you're comfortable running on a CET1 basis over the near to medium term?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure, thanks, and I appreciate that question. I think obviously there's been a lot of changes, there's been some changes and expectations. And I think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to signal flexibility. And certainly, embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to Basel III Endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution.\r\nIt sounds from some of Powell's latest comments that, that may not be something that comes into effect until perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that I think is appropriate in light of what we know and we don't know about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs, but that buffer is designed to support clients, return capital to shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buffer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nHelpful color. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nDevin Ryan, Citizens JMP.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nAll right, great. Good morning, David and Denis. A couple questions on AWM progress. So the first one is on the alts business specifically, and you're tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set the $1 billion medium-term target for annual incentive fees? And now with over $500 billion in alts AUM and obviously growing, that would seem pretty conservative.\r\nSo I appreciate there's a lot of work to do to generate the returns ahead here, but how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more normal harvesting environment, just given the mixed shift and the growth that you're seeing in AUM there?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSo Devin, I think it's a good question, and I think we share your expectation that, that's going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward. We laid it out as one of the building blocks at our Investor Day. The contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective.\r\nWe do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion, so you can make you know various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously bounce around from time-to-time. It is a granular you know vehicle-by-vehicle build-up, but you know given the current outlook and status of those funds that our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years.\r\nSo I think it is an important incremental contributor and should be, you know, should help the return profile of asset wealth management on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nYeah, okay, thanks, Denis. And then follow-up, this is also kind of connected, but at a recent conference, you highlighted the margin profile of all the standalone businesses and asset and wealth management of public peers, so kind of as a comparison and highlighted 35%-plus for alts and some of the public firms we know are obviously well above that.\r\nSo I appreciate you're running the AWM segment is kind of one segment, but if alts does accelerate and we're looking at 60% of alts AUM isn't even the fee earning yet, what does that mean for segment margins relative to kind of that mid-20% target, because you're already at 23% thus far in '24. So just trying to think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth, particularly from the alts segment as well?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSo that's a good question, Devin. I mean, it should be a significant unlock for us because despite the breadth and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is significant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin profile of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall AWM margin, particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy.\r\nAnd so in addition to just overall growth in the segment, which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business, again, despite its current scale, presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution.\n\nDevin Ryan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nDan Fannon, Jefferies.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nThanks, good morning. In terms of your on-balance sheet investments, you continue to make progress in reducing that this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook for this year or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think about?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure. Thank you. Obviously, an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on balance sheet exposures, also part of the equity and capital story and returns in the segment at $2.2 billion for the quarter, that was a decent reduction. We obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at $12.6 billion by the end of next year.\r\nBut our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. There's really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nUnderstood. And as a follow-up, just within asset and wealth, particularly on the alts side, the fundraising target raised for the full-year given the success you've had. The private credit fund closing here in the first-half was big.\r\nCan you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier and/or maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large or increasing momentum as you think about second-half, but also as we even into next year?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure. So you know, obviously taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set, you know, once upon a time it was $150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. It's now at $287 billion and with $36 billion raised through the first-half and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year.\r\nAnd I think one of the things that we find attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives, equity, credit, real estate, infrastructure. We had notable fundraisings in private credit and real estate this quarter, but you can see contribution from other strategies like equity on the forward and a number of different strategies, both by asset class and by region. So we think we have a diversified opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nGood morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape specifically in banking and markets. I know it's always competitive, but some of the really big bank peers, you know, are leaning in who haven't been a few years ago.\r\nAnd all these regional banks that I cover are also realizing that they need broader cap and market capabilities. So you're obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and markets. And I'm just wondering how you're seeing the competition impact you at this point?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure, Matt, and I appreciate the question. I just say, you know, investment banking and the markets business, the trading business, they've always been competitive businesses. I think our integrated One GS approach is a very, very competitive offering. I mean, we can have debates, but it's, I think, one of the top two offerings out there, depending on how you look at it what you look at.\r\nThere's always going to be competition, there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in niche areas, but broadly speaking you know we've had leading M&A share for 25-years. We have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. We've continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. An then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk I think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long time.\r\nAnd so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right resources, both human capital and financial capital, to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we have global scale positions us very well. They'll always be competitors, but I like where our franchise sits. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it, and continue to have it operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nOkay helpful and agreed. And then just separately, I hate to ask you about activity levels and stuff like that since the debate three, four weeks ago, but maybe I'll frame it. From your experience in presidential election periods like this, where there's maybe just more uncertainty than normal, like how do both institutional and corporate clients react? Do they kind of say, well, let's wait and see the other side? Is it just noise, because we've been going through it for some time here, but what are your thoughts on that? Thank you.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nThere are always exogenous factors that affect corporate activity and institutional client activity. I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring, but I think we're well-positioned to serve our clients. Regardless of the environment, the clients are very active at the moment, and I think they're probably going to continue to be active.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nGerard Cassidy, RBC.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nThank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. David, you said in your opening comments that you took the Board out to Silicon Valley and you were impressed with the artificial intelligence and what we could expect in the future and the opportunities for Goldman to be able to finance some of the infrastructure needs that may come of that.\r\nCan you share with us the artificial intelligence that you guys are implementing within Goldman and how it's making you more productive, generating maybe greater revenues or even making it more efficient?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure, I mean, at a high level, Gerard, we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity. And if you think about our business as a professional service firm and a people business, where we have lots of very, very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things that advance their ability to serve clients or interact in markets is a very, very powerful tool.\r\nSo if you look and you think across the scale of our business, I think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and allow the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious.\r\nYou can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter you're all analysts on the phone. There's lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients. You think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what I'll call the factory of the business prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, the revolution's there.\r\nWhen you look at the data sets we have across the firm and our ability to get data and information to clients, so that they can make better decisions around the way they position in markets, that's another obvious use case. For our engineering stack and we have close to 11,000 engineers inside the firm, the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful.\r\nSo those are a handful, there are others. We have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. But again, I'd step back. Well, this will increase our productivity. The thing that we're most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business. And that will create more activity in a tailwind broadly for our businesses. People will need to make investment, they'll need financing, they'll need to scale. And so we're excited about that broad opportunity.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, Denis, you talked about credit, and it was impressive that you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there? It seems like there must be some improvement since obviously you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure. Thanks, Gerard. As you observe, the charge-off rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. What we did see in this quarter was release, and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment.\r\nSo while that was a contributing benefit to sort of call it the net PCL of the quarter with consumer charge-offs offset by that wholesale release, that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future.\r\nAnd although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very, very diligently and consistently, it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments, given our size and scale and representation in the business. But we're pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge-offs is about 0%.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nSaul Martinez, HSBC.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on capital, I mean, it certainly is encouraging that your CET1 ratio rose 20 bps in a quarter where you bought back $3.5 billion of stock and you did have a -- I think, a [$16 billion] reduction in RWA as your presentation talks about credit RWA is falling this quarter? I guess, can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction? And I guess more importantly, is there a continued room for RWA optimization from here to help manage your capital levels?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nSure, thanks, Saul. I appreciate that question. Capital optimization, RWA optimization, is something that we've been committed to for a very long period of time. On the quarter, there were reductions both in credit and market risk RWAs. Drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure, and in some places lower levels of volatility.\r\nWe try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity, as well as being efficient and rotating out of less productive activities or following through on our strategic plan to narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure. So that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter benefit despite the buyback activity we executed. And it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nThank you, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-up on financing, FICC financing up 37%, equities -- equity financing is now something close to 45% of all of your equity sales and trading revenues. I guess how much more room is there, or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set, you know, to continue to grow from here? How much more space is there, you know, to use finding a thing as a mechanism to help deepen penetration with your top institutional clients?\n\nDenis Coleman\n\nThat's a good question, Saul. I think on the FICC financing side, as I indicated, we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. And you know, we think based on what we see currently, that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess the risk return opportunity set across the client portfolio.\r\nSo we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the GBM business.\r\nIn equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously have benefited from equity market inflation over the course of the year, but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients.\r\nAnd clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both FICC and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're doing with us that we're finding some balance between helping them through financing activities, helping them with intermediation, helping them with human capital. So both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nOkay, great, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time there are no additional questions in queue. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs' second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Powell's speech, Bitcoin, retail sales - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell have cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in September. Investors will look to retail sales data for confirmation of a slowing economy, while there are more bank earnings to digest during the session. Meanwhile bitcoin has gained as traders see a Trump presidential victory as more likely after the assassination attempt.\n\n1. Cementing a September rate cut\n\nConfidence is growing that the Federal Reserve will agree to an interest rate cut in September, after Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s reasonably dovish comments on Monday.\n\nIn what could be his last public comments before the Fed goes into a blackout ahead of its July 30-31 policy meeting, Powell remained cautious but suggested that recent inflation data have been in the right direction for the inflation rate to return to the Fed's target of 2%.\n\n\"In the second quarter, actually, we did make some more progress\" on taming inflation, Powell said at an event at the Economic Club of Washington. \"We've had three better readings, and if you average them, that's a pretty good place.\"\n\nPowell also said he does not see the U.S. economy hitting major economic turbulence or an outright recession.\n\nThe comments were enough for markets to once again shift rate expectations, with traders anticipating 68 basis points of easing this year. A rate cut in September is now fully priced in, the CME FedWatch tool showed.\n\n2. Futures slip ahead of retail sales data\n\nU.S. stock futures slipped back Tuesday from record levels, as investors look for more clues about the health of the U.S. economy in the form of retail sales and bank earnings.\n\nBy 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the Dow Jones Futures contract was 40 points, or 0.1%, lower, S&P 500 Futures dropped 9 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell by 22 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe main indices closed higher on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at a new record high, as investors were buoyed by the perceived increased likelihood of a Republican president, which could pave the way for favorable tax and fiscal policies for investors.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Tuesday, mainly from the banking sector, but a lot of focus will also be on the release of the U.S. retail sales data for June.\n\nThis is expected to show a fall of 0.3% on a monthly basis, as consumers struggle with elevated interest rates and high prices.\n\n3. Trump selects Vance as running mate\n\nDonald Trump reentered the spotlight on Monday, receiving a rapturous welcome on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, just a few days after surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump was officially nominated to be the party's 2024 presidential candidate, and announced U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.\n\nThe four-day convention will culminate with Trump's prime-time address on Thursday, when he formally accepts the party's nomination to face President Joe Biden in a rematch of their 2020 race.\n\nThe attack has bolstered expectations of a Trump victory in the November election, particularly in the wake of Biden\u2019s weak performance in the first debate between the two players last month.\n\nPresident Biden gave an interview to NBC on Monday, dismissing concerns about his mental health and indicated that he had no intention of dropping his bid for reelection.\n\nThe race between Trump and Biden remains close, according to public opinion polls, though Trump leads in several swing states likely to decide the election.\n\n4. More bank earnings\n\nThe banking sector will remain in focus Tuesday, with the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the open.\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stated, on Monday, that its profit more than doubled in the second quarter on strong debt underwriting and fixed-income trading, but slipped from a bumper first quarter when earnings were the highest since 2021.\n\nThe resilience of the U.S. economy has given corporate executives the confidence to pursue acquisitions, debt sales and stock offerings.\n\n\u201cWe expect that stock investors will be focusing on Q2's earnings reporting season over the rest of this month through early August,\u201d said analysts at Yardeni Research, in a note.\n\n\u201cIf earnings turn out to be better than expected (as we project), then the bull market should broaden as investors continue to discount cuts in the federal funds rate later this year, as they did on Thursday and Friday. The breadth of positive three-month forward earnings growth rates among the S&P 500 companies continues to widen.\u201d\n\n5. Bitcoin in demand\n\nBitcoin price rose on Tuesday, adding to the previous session\u2019s gains, buoyed by the prospect of friendlier crypto regulations in the U.S. if Donald Trump was to win a second term in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAt 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), Bitcoin rose 0.3% to $63,115, gaining almost 9% this week, and almost 50% year to date.\n\nSpeculation over Trump helped the token rise past concerns over selling pressure from distributions by defunct crypto exchange Mt Gox, which had seen Bitcoin crash to as low as $54,000 earlier in July.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound came after a failed assassination attempt on Trump, over the weekend, was seen as greatly boosting the former president\u2019s popularity.\n\nTrump has maintained a largely supportive stance towards the crypto industry, recently stating that the future of Bitcoin should be built in the U.S. and not overseas.\n\nThis contrasts with a slew of crackdowns against the industry by the SEC and the Department of Justice in recent years.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPowell's speech, Bitcoin, retail sales - what's moving markets\n\nThailand approves $2.8 billion soft loan scheme for commercial banks\n\nInvestors are optimistic but wary of geopolitics, BofA says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Time to Buy BlackRock (BLK) or Goldman Sachs (GS) Stock After Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "This morning, second quarter reports from BlackRock BLK and Goldman Sachs GS provided insight into the prominent investment management banks with both appearing to benefit from easing inflation.\n\nLet\u2019s review BlackRock and Goldman's Q2 results and see if now is a good time to buy stock in these finance titans.\n\nBlackRock Q2 Review\n\nIn what BlackRock stated was one of its strongest performances and highest quarterly growth rates since the pandemic, the company expanded its margin by 160 basis points during Q2.\n\nBlackRock brought in $80 billion in new assets and generated 3% annualized organic base fee growth which was the highest mark during Q2 in three years. Overall, BlackRock ended the quarter with record AUM (Assets Under Management) of over $10.6 trillion.\n\nOperating income of $1.9 billion and EPS of $10.36 spiked 12% respectively with Q2 sales of $4.8 billion expanding 8%. This was attributed to the positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market movement on average AUM. BlackRock\u2019s top and bottom line figures for Q2 registered a surprise of -1% and 4% respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGoldman Sachs Q2 Review\n\nGoldman Sachs was able to beat both its top and bottom line expectations by 1% with Q2 EPS of $8.62 and sales of $12.73 billion. Year over year, Q2 earnings soared 180% from $3.08 a share in the comparative quarter. Quarterly sales increased 17% while total operating expenses were nicely down to $8.53 billion which fueled Goldman\u2019s increased profitability.\n\nNotably, Goldman\u2019s AUM increased by $86 billion and is also sitting at record levels of $2.93 trillion. Goldman also ranked as the worldwide leader in announced and completed mergers so far this year seeing strength in its Global Banking and Asset & Wealth Management segments. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent Performance & Valuation Comparison\n\nYear to date, Goldman\u2019s stock has soared +50% to impressively top the S&P 500\u2019s +25% while BlackRock\u2019s +13% has lagged the broader market.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill, BlackRock's stock trades at 20X forward earnings with Goldman at 13.2X, offering nice discounts to the S&P 500\u2019s 23.6X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBlackrock and Goldman Sachs\u2019 stock currently land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, more upside in these investment management leaders may depend on the trend of earnings estimate revisions following their Q2 results but they remain viable long-term investments, especially with record assets under management.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "US stock futures rise amid Trump speculation, rate cut cheer",
        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Monday, extending gains from the session amid increasing optimism over interest rate cuts, while bets on Donald Trump securing a second term also grew.\n\nWall Street largely shrugged off any political uncertainty stemming from an assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally over the weekend. Initial reactions to the shooting were that it stood to increase Trump\u2019s chances of winning the 2024 presidential race.\n\nDovish-leaning comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell buoyed markets, with traders pricing in an even greater chance the central bank will cut interest rates in September.\n\nSentiment was also supported by stronger-than-expected earnings from Wall Street major Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), which extended a parade of mostly positive bank earnings.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,693.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 20,641.75 points by 19:39 ET (23:39 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,576.0 points.\n\nTrump names running mate as shooting boosts presidential odds\n\nTrump on Monday was officially nominated as the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 presidential race, and named Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nTrump\u2019s chances of a victory were seen increasing sharply after the shooting over the weekend, with a Trump presidency presenting the prospect of a looser regulatory environment in the country. Trump Media&Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) jumped over 30% after the attack, but saw some consolidation in aftermarket trade.\n\nGuns and crypto stocks also advanced on the prospect of a Trump victory.\n\nPowell flags confidence in lower inflation, rate cut bets surge\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Powell said that recent inflation readings had boosted the Fed\u2019s confidence in lower inflation, ramping up bets that the central bank was close to cutting interest rates.\n\nPowell had earlier signaled that the Fed did not have to wait for inflation to reach 2% before cutting rates. His comments sparked a sharp increase in bets that the central bank will cut rates in September.\n\nTraders were no longer seen pricing in the possibility of a hold in September, and were now looking at a 89% chance the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points. Traders were also seen pricing in a small chance the bank will cut rates by 50 basis points, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nOptimism over rate cuts kept Wall Street indexes in sight of record highs. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% to 5,631.22 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.4% to 18,475.86 points on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% and marked a record-high close of 40,211.72 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise amid Trump speculation, rate cut cheer\n\nWall St ends higher as investors firm bets on Trump win, rate cuts\n\nTinder parent Match surges on report of activist interest from Starboard\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u2019s GS second-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $8.62 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52. This compares favorably with $3.08 reported in the year-earlier quarter.\r\n\r\nGoldman\u2019s results have benefited from the strength in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution (FICC) financing revenues, investment banking (IB) and consumer banking business. Further, a decline in expenses and provisions acted as a tailwind.\r\n\r\nNet earnings of $3.04 billion increased significantly from $1.22 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nRevenues Increase and Expenses Fall\n\nNet revenues for the quarter of $12.73 billion increased 16.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.6 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses decreased marginally year over year to $8.53 billion. \r\n\r\nProvision for credit losses was $282 million, plunging 54.1% year over year.\n\nQuarterly Segmental Performance Improves\n\nThe Asset & Wealth Management division generated revenues of $3.88 billion in the reported quarter, up 27.3% year over year. The improvement was driven by higher management and incentive fees, equity investments and higher net revenues in Debt investments, which was partially offset by lower net revenues in Private banking and lending.\r\n\r\nFirmwide assets under supervision were a record $2.93 trillion, up 8.1% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Global Banking & Markets division has recorded revenues of $8.18 billion, which increased 13.8% year over year. The improvement was due to an increase in the IB business (up 21.1%), higher revenues in FICC (up 17.3%), along with a rise in equities revenues (up 6.8%).\r\n\r\nThe Platform Solutions division\u2019s revenues were $669 million, up 1.5% year over year. The rise was driven by higher revenues from consumer platforms.\n\nCapital Ratios Improves\n\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, the standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.8%, up 14.6% on a sequential basis. The company\u2019s supplementary leverage ratio was 5.4%, which remained unchanged from the previous quarter.\n\nCapital Distribution Update\n\nDuring the reported quarter, Goldman returned $4.43 billion of capital to common shareholders. This included $3.50 billion in share repurchases and common stock dividends of $929 million.\r\n\r\nFurther, following the clearance of the 2024 stress test, on Jul 12, GS\u2019 board of directors approved a 9% increase in common stock dividend to $3 per share.\n\nOur View\n\nGoldman\u2019s well-diversified business will continue to support its earnings stability in the upcoming period. Strong performance in IB, FICC financing revenues and consumer banking business acted as a tailwind. Active client engagement and a solid position in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions globally are likely to act as tailwinds. However, a potential economic slowdown is a near-term concern.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Quote\n\nCurrently, Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPerformance of Other Big Banks\n\nWells Fargo & Company's WFC second-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.33 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $1.25.\r\n\r\nWFC's results benefited from higher non-interest income. An improvement in capital ratios and a decline in provisions were other positives. However, the decrease in net interest income, as well as loan and deposit balances, and an increase in expenses were the undermining factors.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\u2019s BK second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43. Also, the bottom line reflects a rise of 9.4% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nBK's results have been primarily aided by a rise in fee revenues and lower expenses. The assets under custody and/or administration and assets under management balances grew on a solid market rally. However, a decline in net interest revenues hurt the results to some extent.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Some of the biggest names on Wall Street urged unity and calm following Saturday's assassination attempt on Donald Trump, using new memos to employees and conference calls with analysts to condemn the violence and call for civil discourse.\n\n\"I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action that celebrates what unites us as citizens and as a society,\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Monday morning as he led off his firm's quarterly earnings call.\n\nSolomon was joined by CEOs from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), BlackRock (BLK), and Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, center, testifies before Congress alongside other bank CEOs during a 2023 oversight hearing. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon weighed in over the weekend in a memo to his employees after his bank, the largest in the US, reported its earnings on Friday.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the political violence and the assassination attempt on former President Trump last evening,\" he wrote on Sunday morning in a memo shared with Yahoo Finance. \"It is only through constructive dialogue that we can tackle our nation's toughest challenges.\"\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also penned a letter to his employees over the weekend, saying \"any form of violence in action or speech has no place in political discourse or engagement,\" and adding \"this is the longstanding position of our company.\"\n\nIn her own letter Monday morning, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser wrote to her employees that \"I hope these events will cause everyone to think about the words we use and tone down the rhetoric so we can have a more civil discourse.\"\n\n\"There is so much riding on it,\" she added.\n\nOne firm with an inadvertent connection to the shooter\n\nAnother call for calm came from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who said \"we must condemn political violence of any kind, period\" during his own firm's quarterly earnings call Monday morning.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the call was devoted to the firm's results, Fink began and ended that call with allusions to the political climate.\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, also confronted an inadvertent connection to the shooter when it surfaced online that an old BlackRock ad focused on a Pennsylvania teacher had briefly shown then-student Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\nCrook's is the 20-year-old who the FBI has identified as the alleged shooter who wounded Trump and was then quickly killed by Secret Service agents. Thomas Matthew Crooks is briefly seen in a screen grab of an BlackRock ad where he appeared for less than a second. (BlackRock)\n\nIn a statement over the weekend, BlackRock confirmed that the footage was authentic and underlined that Crooks, who was briefly shown sitting at a desk and never speaks in the video, was unpaid.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We will make all video footage available to the appropriate authorities, and we have removed the video from circulation out of respect for the victims,\" the statement added.\n\nWill the calls be heeded?\n\nThe wave of financial commentary mirrored a business world outpouring over the weekend from many CEOs, including many in the technology sector.\n\n\"I pray for President Trump's rapid recovery,\" wrote Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook in just one example, adding \"I strongly condemn this violence.\"\n\nWhat remains to be seen if the calls for calm coming from business and world leaders will be heeded. Their are signs that U.S. political leaders in both parties are going to at least try to tone down the rhetoric.\n\n\"The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated,\" Joe Biden said in an address to the nation Sunday night. \"It's time to cool it down.\"\n\nAnd Donald Trump, who saw the bullet pass inches from his skull and injure his ear as he began his speech in Pennsylvania, said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that he'd changed his convention speech in order to help \"bring the country together.\"\n\n\"UNITE AMERICA!\" he added on social media. Donald Trump supporters demonstrate in front of Trump Tower after the former U.S. President was injured during shooting at campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show in Pennsylvania. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBut the aftermath has already been marked by heated \u2014 and many say irresponsible \u2014 rhetoric from partisans on both sides. Some either looked to downplay the violence or even claim it was staged with no evidence.\n\nAlso, in the case of some Republicans, some tried to blame President Biden for the actions of Thomas Crooks.\n\nBiden's \"rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination\" read one highly criticized missive from Sen. J.D. Vance, who is a finalist to become Trump's vice presidential nominee this week.\n\nTrump is already in Milwaukee preparing for this week's Republican National Convention and is expected to make an appearance this evening when proceedings get underway.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Q2 Earnings and Revenues Top Estimates",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) came out with quarterly earnings of $8.62 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52 per share. This compares to earnings of $3.08 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.17%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment bank would post earnings of $8.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $11.58, delivering a surprise of 35.60%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nGoldman , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, posted revenues of $12.73 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.04%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $10.9 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nGoldman shares have added about 24.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Goldman?\n\nWhile Goldman has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Goldman: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $8.36 on $12.67 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $36.25 on $51.49 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - Investment Bank is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Evercore (EVR), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on July 24.\n\nThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +72.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nEvercore's revenues are expected to be $620.36 million, up 23.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Goldman Sachs is posting a massive 150% jump in second quarter profits Monday, helped by a resurgence of dealmaking and underwriting that has revived investment banking after the slow down of the previous couple years.\n\nThe New York investment bank posted net revenues of $3.04 billion, $8.62 per share, compared with $1.22 billion in the same period a year earlier. for the three months ended June 30, compared with $1.22 billion, or $3.08 per share, a year earlier.\n\nPart of the surge in profits is Goldman Sachs had some one-time items last year as it took charges against its books for the wind down of its consumer banking business.\n\nThat said, nearly every aspect of Goldman's businesses saw revenue jump in the quarter, reflecting what has been a broad revival in dealmaking and activity on Wall Street this year in a healthy economy.\n\nInvestment banking fees rose 21%, helped by a big jump in debt underwriting fees for the bank. Many companies are having to refinance their debts to deal with higher interest rates, and there has been a surge in leveraged financing packages\n\nGoldman's fixed income, currencies and commodities trading division had revenues up 17% from a year earlier. Equities trading was less robust than other parts of the market, with Goldman saying net revenues were up 7% in that division.\n\nLastly the bank's asset management division posted 27% rise in revenues, helped by more fee income and the value of Goldman's own investments.\n\nShares in the bank rose slightly before the opening bell.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s trading unit powered a surge in earnings in the second quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Emerges Defiant From Rally Attack Set to Shake Up \u201924 Race I Was at the Trump Rally Where He Was Shot. Here Is What I Saw Global Markets Ramp Up the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019 After Rally Attack\n\nBoth fixed-income and equity traders outpaced analysts\u2019 estimates, while a rebounding capital-markets business helped drive better-than-expected results across much of the company\u2019s Wall Street operations.\n\nStill, in a surprise reversal, the company pocketed less in fees from arranging mergers than JPMorgan Chase & Co. Goldman tends to lead the industry in that business and rarely falls behind its rival.\n\nEven as more businesses are on the prowl for deals, the approaching US elections could further delay a return to the pace of growth in the merger business seen in recent years. The business is especially important for Goldman because the firm has tried to showcase its strong investment bank and growing asset-management business, after abandoning an expansion into consumer banking.\n\nEarnings in the second quarter were almost three times what Goldman posted a year ago, when it was plagued by losses in real estate investments and the consumer-banking unit in the middle of an industrywide dealmaking slowdown. Net income was $3.04 billion, on $12.7 billion in revenue in the three months through June 30.\n\nShares of the New York-based company advanced 24% this year, propelling the stock to an all-time high of $479.88 on Friday.\n\nStrategy Shuffle\n\nLast month, in a surprise move, the bank tapped John Mahoney, a financial-services banker who has been with the firm since 1987, to oversee firmwide strategy. That\u2019s a departure from recent years, when Goldman had been tapping younger, fast-rising executives destined for bigger jobs at the firm for a similar role. The firm is also turning to a merger banker for a strategy role at a time when it has preached caution about the need for acquisitions to grow, especially after pursuing multiple deals to build out a retail-banking business that flopped.\n\nGoldman has instead tried to pare its focus to expanding its investment bank and money-management business to achieve its mid-teens return-on-equity target. It fell short of that mark in the second quarter, notching 10.9%.\n\nThe fixed-income trading business posted $3.18 billion in revenue, driven by strength in rates and currencies. The stock-trading unit logged $3.17 billion. Goldman touted its second-best quarter ever across both businesses in financing revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestment-banking revenue of $1.73 billion fell short of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.8 billion. Merger-advisory fees were $688 million. That was less than the $785 million that JPMorgan reported last week.\n\nGoldman\u2019s equity capital markets business generated $423 million in revenue, and debt-underwriting revenue was $622 million.\n\nThe asset- and wealth-management business posted revenue of $3.88 billion, up 27% from a year earlier. Management fees climbed 8% as the bank seeks to shift growth to those fees instead of windfalls from balance-sheet investments.\n\nGoldman said last quarter that it raised its biggest war chest yet for private-credit wagers. The firm closed the latest iteration of its direct-lending fund, which along with separately managed accounts for the same strategy amounted to $21 billion. The bank also clinched a $43 billion mandate to invest pension-fund assets of parcel-delivery company UPS, in one of the largest deals of its kind.\n\nThat progress has helped the bank stay on track to exceed a target is spelled out earlier this year of raising $50 billion in alternative assets.\n\nIn consumer banking, revenue was up 4% and transaction-banking fees dropped 15% from a year earlier. Those businesses are part of the unit that the bank has been disassembling as it reverses its push into retail banking.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Exclusive-Goldman Sachs targets $2 billion for first Asia-focused private equity fund, sources say",
        "content": "By Kane Wu\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs aims to raise $2 billion in its first Asia Pacific-focused private equity fund, two people with knowledge of the bank's fundraising plan said, as it looks to deepen exposure to some of the world's fastest-growing economies.\n\nThe fund-raising effort comes as private equity firms in Asia reshape investment strategies and country allocations amid geopolitical tension, a higher interest rate environment, market volatility, and macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nGoldman Sachs Asset Management, the bank's investment arm, has been marketing the new fund to sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and private investors, setting its sights on a first close by the fourth quarter, the sources said.\n\nThe fund, whose target size is being reported for the first time, will focus primarily on investment opportunities in Japan, with about half its capital expected to be allocated to there, one of the sources said.\n\nIndia, South Korea, and Australia will also be key markets for the fund, the source said.\n\nBoth sources sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nA spokesperson for Goldman declined to comment.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Asia-focused private equity fundraising was up 4% on the year at $52.7 billion, but still a far cry from the first-half average in the past decade of $131.7 billion, says industry data provider Preqin.\n\nGlobal investors have been particularly cautious about deploying capital in China, deterred by its economic slowdown, regulatory crackdown and Sino-U.S. tension, which have all weighed on Asia fundraising by global private equity firms.\n\nOnly five China-focused private equity funds were raised in the first half this year, totalling $2.2 billion, Preqin data showed.\n\nOn the other hand, Japan has become a hot spot for private equity firms as a cheap yen currency, buoyant public market and policy drives to improve corporate governance make its stocks and assets more attractive.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei racked up its biggest absolute rise ever for the year ended March 29, after having hit record levels since February. It is up 23% this year.\n\nPrivate equity-backed mergers and acquisitions in Japan stood at a record $35.5 billion in 2023, after their numbers rose steadily in the preceding decade, LSEG data showed.\n\nStephanie Hui, Goldman's head of Asia private equity and global co-head of growth equity, told an Australian paper in March the firm was looking to raise an Asia-focused vehicle, and planned to increase investments in Japan and India.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the sources told Reuters that Goldman, which manages more than $90 billion in private equity assets globally, including buyouts and growth investments, would also continue to look at opportunities in China.\n\nThe Wall Street bank's 18-strong Asia private equity team, led by Hong Kong-based Hui, has deployed $17 billion across 242 investments in the region, its website says.\n\nIn February Chief Executive David Solomon said Goldman would raise its ninth global private equity fund this year. The bank has been in the private equity business for more than 30 years.\n\nSince Solomon took the reins in 2019, the bank has been reducing use of its own balance sheet in asset management, by tapping external capital for investments, aiming to boost earnings from fees.\n\nOver the last five years, the bank has invested in more than 60 companies in Asia, such as Japan's Nippo Corp and Chinese software company Shenzhen Qianhai 4Paradigm Data Technology Co, Dealogic data showed.\n\nGoldman was also among the earliest investors in China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group in 1999, before it became the nation's major online shopping marketplace.\n\n(Reporting by Kane Wu; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Clarence Fernandez)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the new week on a positive note, as investors digest the implications of the attempt on former President Donald Trump's life, ahead of a deluge of corporate earnings, including from Goldman Sachs, and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\n1. Trump set to receive Republican nomination this week\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention starts later Monday in Milwaukee, with former President Donald Trump set to receive his party's official nomination just a few days after narrowly escaping an attempted assassination.\n\nTrump is likely to be nominated as the party\u2019s frontrunner for the presidential race, with many analysts speculating that the shooting has actually increased his chances of a victory over President Joe Biden.\n\nThe assassination attempt has also appeared to have lowered the pressure from congressional Democrats for Biden to step aside in the race amid concerns about his fitness for office, as the party pulls together.\n\nSome Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate have publicly called upon Biden to drop out in the aftermath of his shaky performance in a June debate against Trump.\n\nBoth leaders counseled calm over the weekend, aiming to lower temperatures in a country whose deep political divide has grown even more pronounced during the presidential race.\n\n2. Futures rise with earnings, Powell in focus\n\nU.S. stock futures rose Monday as investors await a big week of corporate earnings as well as comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 135 points, or 0.3%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 17 points, or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 88 points, or 0.4%.\n\nThe second-quarter earnings season [see below] will be in focus this week\u2013more than 40 S&P 500 companies are reporting\u2013with investors wondering if the results will be strong enough to push the indices higher, given they are already at record levels.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a fresh all-time high above 40,000 on Friday, adding to the record highs the broad-based S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered last week.\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell will also be in the spotlight, as he is set to be interviewed by David Rubenstein at the Economic Club of Washington DC.\n\nIn his recent testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell highlighted the central bank's ongoing efforts to tackle inflation and its commitment to a dual mandate, and investors will be looking for more clues over a potential cut in interest rates in September.\n\n3. Goldman leads off earnings week\n\nThe U.S. quarterly earnings season continues this week, with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) set to release its numbers later in the session after a number of its rivals started the ball rolling late last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe expectations will be high after Citigroup (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported huge growth in investment banking revenues, even if Wells Fargo 's (NYSE:WFC) decline in net interest income disappointed investors.\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are expected to follow as the week progresses, as well as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the first of the tech giants that have driven much of the equity gains this year.\n\nSecond-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have jumped 10.1% year-over-year, based on LSEG data as of Friday, accelerating from 8.2% growth in the first quarter.\n\nS&P 500 earnings growth has been improving since a year-over-year decline in the second quarter of 2023, largely because of growth in tech-focused companies and optimism over artificial intelligence.\n\n4. China\u2019s economic growth showed in Q2\n\nChina's economic growth slowed in the second quarter, data showed on Monday, as a protracted property downturn weighed heavily on domestic demand.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy grew 4.7% in April-June, its weakest growth since the first quarter of 2023, and down from the 5.3% expansion in the previous quarter.\n\nSeparate data showed that China's industrial output rose 5.3% in June from a year earlier, slowing from 5.6% in May, while retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.0% in June, slowing significantly from a 3.7% increase in May.\n\nThis weakness places the focus on China's third plenum, a seminal event typically held every five years which starts on Monday, amid expectations Beijing will need to unleash more stimulus to support the economy.\n\n5. Crude stable despite weak Chinese economic data\n\nCrude prices stabilized Monday, with weak Chinese data balanced by raised political uncertainty.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.1% to $80.94 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $84.95 a barrel.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy registered its weakest growth since the first quarter of 2023,\n\nAdditionally, China's crude oil imports fell 2.3% in the first half of this year to 11.05 million barrels a day, amid disappointing fuel demand.\n\nThis data indicates the country is facing increased economic headwinds, and this is likely to bode poorly for crude demand in this vitally important market.\n\nThat said, losses have been limited with political uncertainty in the U.S. and the Middle East supporting prices.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTrump, Powell's speech, Goldman earnings - what's moving markets\n\nBurberry axes CEO and dividend, warns on profit\n\nFrance 'dangerously exposed' in case of economic shock, national audit office says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Netflix results, retail sales, and a chip update: What to watch this week",
        "content": "The biggest economic event of July has come and gone.\n\nFor the balance of the month, investors will focus most of their attention on the corporate earnings calendar.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) will be the first Big Tech company to report quarterly earnings during the current reporting period, with the streaming giant set to release results after the close on Thursday.\n\nAnd with the AI trade continuing to dominate on Wall Street, investors will pay close attention to results from ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), set for release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nASML is the leading manufacturer of lithography machines, which enable companies to actually imprint their designs onto new chips. TSMC is the world's biggest chip manufacturer.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings calendar, reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) will wrap up results from Wall Street's biggest banks, while Dow members Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Travelers (TRV) are all expected to report.\n\nPolitics will also be a top concern for investors after Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Business leaders were quick to react to the day's events, condemning political violence and praising the former president's \"courage under literal fire [Saturday night].\"\n\nThe Republican National Convention is set to be held this week in Milwaukee, which will see Trump formally named the Republican nominee for president.\n\nThe economic data calendar will be sparse, with Tuesday's retail sales report for June serving as the highlight. After May's results showed a surprise slowdown in spending, investors and Fed watchers will monitor the results for signs of further weakness in the US consumer.\n\nThe team at Oxford Economics expects retail sales to fall 0.4% in June, though this headline drop will be driven by a decline in gas prices. \"We expect a solid 0.3% rise in underlying control group sales, which, with prices declining in June, will translate into a strong rise in real consumption to round out Q2,\" the firm wrote in a note on Friday.\n\n\"The consumer is still in solid shape, underpinned by a labor market that is cooling, not collapsing, and the strong state of household balance sheets.\"\n\nThursday's inflation data turned markets upside down, with everything that had been working (read: \"Magnificent Seven\" names) coming under pressure and what had been left behind, most notably small caps, surging. Still, Friday's rally sent stocks into the weekend with another weekly gain across the board.\n\nStory continues\n\nJuly \u27a1\ufe0f September\n\nJune inflation data published last week appeared to almost cement the prospects of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates beginning in September.\n\nA multiyear low in annual inflation and the first monthly drop in headline inflation since 2020 pushed the odds north of 85% that rate cuts will start in the fall, data from the CME Group showed.\n\nIn June, headline inflation fell 0.1% from the prior month and rose 3% against the prior year. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy costs, consumer prices were up 0.2% from last month and 3.3% from last year.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation.\n\nJune's jobs report published earlier this month raised the temperature on the Fed to act in September. The unemployment rate move up to 4.1% signaled the pace of cooling in the labor market appears to be accelerating and puts the labor market back in focus for the central bank after nearly two years of inflation being its primary concern.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's appearance on Capitol Hill last week made clear the central bank's move this fall will be perceived as a political decision by critics on both sides of the aisle. But the economic basis for a rate cut has only grown clearer in recent weeks.\n\n\"On balance, the economic data are the most supportive of a rate cut that they have been all year,\" wrote Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese in a client note this week.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre noted this week, the unemployment rate is now on the cusp of triggering the Sahm Rule, which measures the rate of increase in the unemployment rate and has been a leading indicator in each of the last nine US recessions.\n\nOn July 31, Powell will hold a press conference following the conclusion of the Fed's next two-day policy meeting. This event, along with Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late August, will give the chair plenty of opportunity to prime markets for a move come September.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has lodged an appeal with the U.S. Federal Reserve challenging its result in the regulator's most recent \"stress test\", which is set to force the bank to hold a greater amount of capital, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's annual \"stress test\" exercise showed last month that the biggest U.S. banks would have enough capital to withstand severe economic and market turmoil but firms faced steeper hypothetical losses this year due to riskier portfolios.\n\nThe tested banks overall saw losses of 17.6% to existing loan balances on credit cards and among them Goldman Sachs recorded 25.4% in losses.\n\nGoldman had one of the biggest increases in stress capital buffers (SCB) at 94 basis points.\n\nHow well a bank performs on the stress tests dictates the size of its stress capital buffer (SCB) - an extra cushion of capital the Fed requires banks to hold to weather a hypothetical economic downturn.\n\nGoldman said it will engage with its regulator to better understand why its SCB jumped.\n\n\"This increase does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity,\" CEO David Solomon said in a statement last month.\n\nGoldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the FT report.\n\n(Reporting by Akanksha Khushi in Bengaluru; editing by David Evans)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 3 Blue Chip Dividend Stocks Make Up 24% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Here's My Top Pick.",
        "content": "Created in 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the best-known U.S. indexes. It is price-weighted, meaning its 30 components are weighted based on their stock prices rather than their market caps. This means that stock splits can have a major impact on the Dow.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH), and Goldman Sachs Group(NYSE: GS) are the three largest Dow components and all trade at over $460 a share. Together, they make up roughly 24% of the Dow,\u00a0whereas the average component holds a mere 3.3% weighting.\n\nAll three companies operate in vastly different industries but pay stable and growing dividends. Here's why Microsoft is my favorite pick out of the three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIts broad-based exposure to growth\n\nThe simplest reason to buy and hold Microsoft is its exposure to trends and its leadership across industries. The company is a top player in cloud infrastructure, software and hardware for commercial customers and individual consumers, developer tools, enterprise software, and more.\n\nMicrosoft has done a masterful job monetizing artificial intelligence (AI) across its business. The company's generative AI tool, Copilot, probably has been the biggest update in the history of its Office 365 suite of software. Azure AI helps developers build intelligent cloud-native applications on the Azure platform.\n\nWhile other companies believe AI will help them accelerate growth in the future, Microsoft is already seeing significant profitability improvements across its business. It is a proven winner in AI, which is why it deserves a higher valuation than its historical average. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSince operating income is growing even faster than revenue, Microsoft's margins are hovering around 10-year highs, while sales have roughly doubled in the last five years. If it sustains impressive growth, it could help the company reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nMaintaining industry leadership\n\nIndustry-leading companies that can continue to grow can be great investments. But the tech sector is chock-full of great businesses that either no longer exist, were bought out on the cheap, or are a shell of what they used to be. That's why companies must invest in research and development and continue innovating.\n\nWhen I look at the mega-cap tech companies, Microsoft stands out as offering the best balance between stability and innovation.\n\nFor example, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is a significantly less expensive stock than Microsoft, but its business model is more fragile. Google Cloud is a distant third behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. YouTube is a powerhouse, but ChatGPT, TikTok, and Meta Platforms' Instagram are challenging Google's impenetrable moat in search. So while Alphabet is cheaper today, slower earnings growth could make it more expensive than Microsoft in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn sum, being more cautious when calling a company a surefire bet in tech is important. For stodgy companies like Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, the name of the game is to sustain quality brands, develop a pipeline of new products, and make savvy acquisitions.\n\nBut tech companies have to manage capital well and innovate. BlackBerry lost to Apple because it failed to pivot away from buttons to the touch screen. AOL faded into history when broadband replaced dial-up internet. The list goes on and on.\n\nMicrosoft not only has the diversification needed to take a market share hit in one of its business units, but it is also a proven innovator and excellent capital allocator that has been on the right side of the AI-led movement in tech.\n\nIts massive capital return program\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend every year since fiscal 2011. At the time, it paid a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend. Today, the dividend is $0.75 per share -- a nearly fivefold increase in just 14 years.\n\nMicrosoft's decision to consistently raise its dividend is a testament to its confidence that it can continue to grow earnings. With over $21 billion in trailing-12-month dividend expenses, it pays more dividends than any other U.S.-based company (by far).\n\nAnd that's not all: Microsoft also buys back a ton of its own stock. Over the last 12 months, it has repurchased $16.8 billion of its stock compared to $10.5 billion in stock-based compensation.\n\nDue to its size and the tech industry's habit of rewarding employees with stock, Microsoft has to buy back at least as much stock as it pays in stock-based compensation to avoid diluting existing shareholders. It has been no easy challenge, as the company's stock-based compensation expense has doubled over the last five years. MSFT Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nOverall, Microsoft has committed to its capital return program by making annual (and significant) dividend raises while avoiding increasing its share count. The payout only yields 0.6%, but that's because the stock has posted massive outsize gains. The dividend is up 477% over the last 15 years, but the stock is up 1,870%.\n\nFor the dividend yield to increase, the dividend has to grow faster than the stock price. Microsoft's last five dividend raises were all around 10%. So if the stock cools off, we could see the yield increase.\n\nEither way, Microsoft is an underrated dividend stock heavily committed to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nIt deserves a premium valuation\n\nMicrosoft is arguably the best company in the world due to its current position, high-margin growth trajectory, and ability to fund a sizable dividend and stock-buyback programs with cash.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the stock is its 40.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 10-year median P/E of 30.6. However, Microsoft is a much better business now than in the past, especially given the growth of cloud infrastructure and the AI improvements across proven products.\n\nIn this regard, Microsoft's valuation is more reasonable than it appears at first glance. The company will have to maintain an impressive growth rate to keep this high multiple, but it has what it takes. Investors interested in quality companies, even at a premium price, should consider Microsoft now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Finding millionaire-making stocks is not easy. While we can\u2019t tell the future, we can do the next best thing: think forward, gauge a company\u2019s room for growth, and determine how it intends to reach the next level.\n\nHere lies the beauty of mid-cap stocks, a market cap category sometimes overlooked in favor of large and mega caps. For the uninitiated, mid-cap stocks trade with a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion. Some consider it the sweet spot between growth potential and stability because the business is already established while still having more room for growth.\n\nInvestors can do their research to find some of the best long-term superstars. Or, better yet, I can lend you a hand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at three mid-cap stocks with \u201cmillion-maker potential.\u201d I screened the market using the criteria below to get my list:\n\nMust have a market cap of $2-10 billion, At least three consecutive fiscal years of positive gross profit margin growth Buy ratings from analysts, At least three consecutive fiscal years of positive revenue and earnings growth.\n\nI then sorted the list based on how much their gross profits increased during the last three years from highest to lowest to ensure that I don\u2019t only focus on revenue and earnings growth but also a higher quality of growth over time.\n\nADMA Biologics (ADMA) medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stock\n\nSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the leaders in specialty plasma-derived products, ADMA Biologics (NASDAQ:ADMA) is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in immunodeficient patient treatments. The company has three U.S. FDA-approved plasma-derived biologics:\n\nASCENIV: Helps raise the body\u2019s immune system to treat PIDD. BIVIGAM: Used for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) NABI-HB: Provides patients with enhanced protection against the hepatitis B virus.\n\nADMA recently announced that the FDA has approved extended room temperature storage for ASCENIV and BIVIGAM. This approval helps with storage constraints that the drugs were experiencing due to limited refrigeration space.\n\nADMA\u2019s last three fiscal years have seen a remarkable financial turnaround. Gross margins in FY\u201920 were originally at -45.17%, growing to 34.44% in FY\u201923. This showcases the company\u2019s operational efficiency and cost management advancements.\n\nNot only that but both revenue and earnings improved. Revenue grew from $42.22 million in FY\u201920 to $258.22 million in FY\u201923. While the company is still operating at a loss, losses have shrunk from $75.75 million in FY\u201920 to $28.24 million in FY\u201923.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, the company will be profitable in 2024, which will justify Wall Street\u2019s strong buy rating. So, if you\u2019re looking for millionaire-making stocks, look no further than ADMA.\n\nCorporacion America Airports SA (CAAP) two women carrying luggage in an airport\n\nSource: Shine Nucha / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the leading operators of private airports worldwide, Corporacion America Airports SA (NYSE:CAAP) specializes in the acquisition, development, and operation of airport concessions in various parts of Europe, Eurasia, and Latin America.

Total revenue surged from $607.36 million in FY\u201920 to $1.4 billion in FY\u201923, and gross profit margins improved from negative 7.6% to positive 34.67% over the same period. At the same time, the company went from losing $361.89 million in 2020 to steadily improving its bottom line, with the latest annual net income coming in at $226.47 million.\n\nThese consistent improvements, successful recovery, and growth trajectory have earned CAAP stock a strong buy rating from top brokers like CitiGroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), making it a strong contender for the top millionaire-making stocks.\n\nOceaneering International (OII) a technician lowering an exploratory robot into the ocean at dawn\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Opsorman\n\nOceaneering International (NYSE:OII) is an energy and equipment services company specializing in robotics for various industries like offshore energy, aerospace, manufacturing, and other sectors.

        "title": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:GS) large institutional owners must be happy as stock continues to impress, up 3.3% over the past week",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Goldman Sachs Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 46% of the company Insiders have been selling lately\n\nEvery investor in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nAnd as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 3.3% last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 52% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Goldman Sachs Group, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Goldman Sachs Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Goldman Sachs Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 5.8% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs Group\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$776m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted  2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "A Wall Street revival is carrying big banks as Main Street struggles",
        "content": "A Wall Street revival provided a second-quarter boost to big banks at a time of rising challenges for their Main Street consumer operations.\n\nInvestment banking fees jumped at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) from a year ago as dealmaking showed more signs of life following a two-year-long slump. Trading revenue was also up for all three institutions.\n\n\"We are happy to see the progress,\" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts.\n\nStocks of all three banks fell, however, as higher interest states and elevated deposit costs ate away at more traditional consumer banking margins. The banks also set aside more money for future loan losses when compared with a year ago, a sign that they expect credit conditions to worsen.\n\nWhat attracted the most attention from investors Friday was that a key measure of lending profit known as net interest income fell at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup from the previous quarter as customers continue to migrate to higher-yielding deposit products like CDs.\n\nNet interest income accounts for the difference between what banks earn from their loans and pay out on their deposits.\n\nThis measure at JPMorgan declined 1% from the prior quarter. If not for a $8 billion one-time accounting gain tied to an exchange of shares in credit card giant Visa (V), JPMorgan\u2019s overall net profit would have declined 9% from a year ago.\n\nIts stock was roughly flat in midday trading.\n\nThe decline in lending income at Wells Fargo was deeper than analysts anticipated, helping to push its stock down more than 7%.\n\nSeveral analysts hoped Wells Fargo might offer a higher revision to its net interest income guidance for the full year. Instead, the bank seemed more comfortable in a lower range, predicting it would fall between 8% and 9%.\n\nBut even Wells Fargo benefited from more Wall Street activity. Its investment banking revenues surged 38% to $430 million.\n\nAt JPMorgan, investment banking rose 50% from last year, to $2.35 billion. At Citigroup, those fees jumped 60% in the second quarter to $853 million.\n\n'Green shoots'\n\nWall Street has been waiting two years for this moment, enduring repeated false starts.\n\nLast year was supposed to be the year things turned around as executives touted a string of IPOs and merger announcements. Instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade, as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far this year, things are looking up despite lingering concerns about the inflation, geopolitical tensions and an uncertain presidential election outcome.\n\nThe second-quarter Wall Street results from JPMorgan and Citigroup were also a good sign for other Wall Street heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) that are due to report earnings next week.\n\nDespite the improvement, Barnum of JPMorgan was careful Friday not to get too excited about the investment banking performance as he cited potential headwinds. One potential problem is an intense focus from federal regulators on antitrust concerns, which some market observers say is depressing deal activity.\n\n\"The dialogue on M&A is robust, I would say, a little bit more elevated,\u201d Barnum said. But \u201cthere's a little bit of a chilling effect on M&A because of the regulatory environment, and that remains the case.\u201d Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. (Photo by Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also offered some general caution in a press release, saying that \"while market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks.\"\n\nHe referenced geopolitical tensions and persistent inflationary forces, adding that \"inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.\"\n\nDimon did not attend JPMorgan\u2019s second-quarter earnings conference calls with reporters or analysts Friday.\n\nThe reason given by bank executives: a travel conflict.\n\nThe bank\u2019s spokesman told reporters Dimon was flying back from Germany after helping to celebrate the bank\u2019s 100th anniversary in that country.\n\nThe bank CFO, Barnum, told reporters \"it's a travel conflict, that's it. There's literally nothing more to it.\u201d\n\nBarnum said Dimon almost always attends the calls and \u201cthat should continue to be the expectation.\u201d\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

What\u2019s left will be a streamlined business that contains the company\u2019s prized copper mines (BHP\u2019s main target), its premium iron ore business and the Woodsmith fertiliser project in North Yorkshire.\n\nAnglo is heavily exposed to copper and the industrial metal\u2019s price is just starting to pull back after a strong run.\n\nFor the actual earnings report, AJ Bell tells investors to look for any hints on production costs.\n\n\u201cThe details on the balance sheet, cash flow and profit and loss account will come with the actual first-half numbers, although do watch out for any changes in output forecasts and targets, as well as comments on cost of production and capital investment, since all of those will directly influence profits and cash flow,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How FTSE All-Share index listings are changing\n\n\u201cIn the unlikely event that [CEO Duncan] Wanblad discusses annual profits or the dividend ahead of the first-half results in the following week, the current consensus forecast is for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to come in broadly flat in 2024, at $9.7bn, while a cut in the dividend to $0.83 per share from $0.96 is expected.\u201d\n\nThe share price is still around 20% higher than it was before BHP\u2019s interest became public on 25 April.\n\nBurberry (BRBY.L) - Reports trading update on Friday, 19 July\n\nTrenchcoat-maker Burberry is not expected to impress investors next week, with retail same-store sales estimated to come in 16% lower in its fiscal first quarter, a slump made even starker by 18% growth in the same period last year.\n\nUBS expects the focus to be on Chinese sales \u201cas well as any signs of stabilisation/improvement among other consumer groups (i.e. Americans and Europeans)\u201d.\n\nJP Morgan has warned that the \u2018re-acceleration\u2019 of the luxury sector could be slower than anticipated, leading to downside risk for luxury stocks.\n\n\u201cThe troubled times continue for Burberry, which has engaged in a round of sweeping job cuts in order to reduce costs. Sales fell 4% for the year to the end of March, and it looks like demand in the key market of China will continue to weaken,\u201d IG said.\n\nShares in Burberry are down by more than half over the past year, to take them back to levels last seen in 2010.\n\nCompared to its five-year average PE of 17 times earnings, Burberry now looks cheap at 11 times earnings. IG analysts warned that while the dividend yield is a solid 7%, investors should be aware that the payout may be cut should the group\u2019s sales outlook continue to worsen.\n\nFor the year to March 2025, analysts currently expect sales to drop 6% to \u00a32.8bn.\n\nTSMC (TSM) \u2013 Reports quarterly update on Thursday, 18 July\n\nThe AI craze has pushed Nvidia as other Magnificent 7 stocks to new heights but there is no AI without chips. And they are (almost) all being manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s key tech giant clients such as Nvidia and Apple have almost nowhere else to turn for next-gen chip manufacturing.\n\nTSMC\u2019s anticipated order for next-generation two-nanometer technology will be a key catalyst in the second half, according to Citi analysts, who see AI and sovereign investment adding upside to the company\u2019s 2030 revenue target of \u20ac44bn to \u20ac60bn, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe Taiwan-based silicon giant disclosed in its latest monthly revenue report that net income for June was NT$207.87bn billion ($6.4bn), an increase of 32.9% compared with a year ago.\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFigures for May and April were NT$229.62bn ($7.04bn/) and NT$236.02bnn (\u00a35.41bn/$7.24bn), both up on the same period last year. TSMC is projected to grow sales by roughly 21% in FY24 and FY25.\n\n\u201cTaiwan Semiconductor is one of the most straightforward buy-and-hold options in all of technology alongside the likes of Nvidia and others because chips are the lifeblood of the economy and TSM is the semiconductor manufacturer,\u201d according to Zachs Research.\n\n\u201cAny near-term pullback down to some of Taiwan Semiconductor stock\u2019s key shorter-dated or longer-dated moving averages could mark a screaming buy signal for long-term investors,\u201d Zachs\u2019 analysts added.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) \u2013 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday, 18 July\n\nSynonymous with streaming services, Netflix will show investors how it is fighting to stay on top and prove it can keep attracting new subscribers amid fierce competition.\n\nNetflix expects its revenue to increase 16% year-over-year (YoY) to $9.49bn (\u00a37.3bn) in the second quarter of 2024 but analysts predict Netflix's Q2 revenue will be slightly higher at $9.53bn. In the first quarter of 2024, Netflix's revenue was $9.37bn, up 15% from the prior year.\n\nMorningstar equity analyst Matthew Dolphin provides a guide to what investors should focus on. \u201cWe're most interested in details on Netflix's ad-supported service, especially regarding how the firm is coming along in monetising it, as well as an update on the size of the ad-supported user base,\" he said.\n\n\u201cGenerally, we'll be looking to see if subscriber growth is slowing substantially after Netflix passed the tailwind from its password-sharing crackdown, and whether it will stop regularly disclosing this metric in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe will also be interested in international sales and subscriber growth. This will be a key driver for the company when/if domestic growth slows,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs AJ Bell writes, Netflix no longer gives specific guidance for quarterly net subscriber additions, although co-chief executive officers Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos did suggest at the first-quarter stage that net adds would come in below the first quarter\u2019s bumper 9.3 million (the best first quarter since the pandemic and lockdowns in Q1 2020). That took the total subscriber base to a fraction under 270 million, up from 233 million in Q1 2023 and 167 million before the pandemic swept the globe.\n\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, is also keen to look at subscribers: \u201cOne thing to watch for is the number of new paid subscribers in the second quarter. Management has already warned it\u2019ll be lower quarter-on-quarter due to the normal seasonal demand patterns. These have been a little skewed in recent years, but looking at 2018/19 numbers, net new subscribers were down 34% and 70% respectively across the first and second quarters \u2013 so don\u2019t be surprised to see something in that range.\n\n\u201cBest in class content is one of the reasons Netflix has been able to consistently deliver sector leading churn rates. It\u2019s expensive, but Netflix remains the only company set to increase content spend, giving a comparative advantage versus legacy media and its challengers.\u201d\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday, 15 July\n\nRobert Walters (RWA.L)\n\nOrkla (ORK.OL)\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS)\n\nBlackRock (BLK)\n\nTuesday, 16 July\n\nOcado (OCDO.L)\n\nIntermediate Capital (ICG.L)\n\nB&M European Value Retail (BME.L)\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nMcBride (MCB.L)\n\nRichemont (CFR.SW)\n\nNCC (NCC.L)\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH)\n\nBank of America (BAC)\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS)\n\nOmnicom (OMC)\n\nWednesday, 17 July\n\nRenold (RNO.L)\n\nHVIVO (HVO.L)\n\nBHP (BHP.L)\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nAssa Abloy (ASSA-B.ST)\n\nSvenska Handelsbanken (SHB-B.ST)\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nCSX (CSX)\n\nUS Bancorp (USBC.VI)\n\nLas Vegas Sands (LVS)\n\nCitizens Financial (CZFS)\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL)\n\nAlcoa (AA)\n\nBank OZK (OZK)\n\nThursday, 18 July\n\nSSE (SSE.L)\n\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\n\nDunelm (DNLM.L)\n\nKier (KIE.L)\n\nQinetiQ (QQ.L)\n\nABB (ABBNY)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATCO-A.ST)\n\nVolvo (VOLV-A.ST)\n\nEQT (EQT)\n\nPublicis (PUB.PA)\n\nNokia (NOK)\n\nVolvo Car (VOLCAR-B.ST)\n\nSKF (SKF-B.ST)\n\nAbbott Labs (ABL.MU)\n\nBlackstone (BX)\n\nDR Horton (DHI)\n\nTractor Supply (TSCO)\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)\n\nInterpublic (IPG)\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL)\n\nAlaska Airlines (ALK)\n\nFriday, 19 July\n\nBridgepoint (BPT.L)\n\nSchindler (SHLRF)\n\nKone (KNEBV.HE)\n\nSandvik (SAND.ST)\n\nSaab (SAABBS.XC)\n\nElectrolux (ELUXY)\n\nAmerican Express (AXP)\n\nSchlumberger (SLB)\n\nHalliburton (HAL)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Supported by the Urban Investment Group at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Access by Calvert Impact focuses on increasing access to credit for small businesses\n\nBETHESDA, Md., July 12, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Calvert Impact today announced the launch of Access by Calvert Impact, a national public-private partnership to support small businesses, with the closing of an $140 million warehouse credit facility from the Urban Investment Group (UIG) at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. Access is Calvert Impact\u2019s national program that leverages government funds from the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) with private investment dollars to provide access to capital for the country\u2019s smallest businesses with and through a network of community lenders.\n\nThe design and development of the Access program was originally made possible by grants from the Citi Foundation and the Wells Fargo Foundation, which supported Calvert Impact and its program partners -- Community Reinvestment Fund USA and Grow America -- to build out a new community finance tool that enables state governments to leverage the expertise of community lenders to reach hard-to-serve small businesses. The program aggregates business loans originated by community lenders to be seasoned and sold onto the secondary market, generating a new source of capital access for the community finance sector. The Access program is highly replicable and currently active in the states of New York, New Jersey, Nevada and Washington.\n\n\"The Access program is working to address the liquidity and balance sheet constraints that have hamstrung the CDFI industry for decades and unleash CDFI lenders' full potential to serve their communities,\" said Jenn Pryce, CEO of Calvert Impact. \"The ability to warehouse assets afforded by this new credit facility is going to be critical to our ability to stand up new funds and achieve the national scale we are targeting with the Access program.\"\n\n\"Goldman Sachs has deep experience supporting small businesses through our 10,000 Small Businesses program, and we know that the combination of education and capital is critical to accelerating their success. We\u2019re proud to anchor and fund this powerful public-private partnership that unlocks capital for America\u2019s economic growth engines and we hope this facility will serve as a blueprint that can be replicated across the country,\" said Asahi Pompey, Goldman Sachs\u2019 global head of Corporate Engagement and president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nThe Treasury Department's SSBCI brings access to capital and technical assistance to historically un- and under-banked small businesses through community lenders like community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and credit unions. Access, which leverages capital available to participating states via the SSBCI, was designed to serve business owners from socially and economically disadvantaged (SEDI) backgrounds \u2013 a policy priority of the SSBCI program \u2013 and to date, more than 80 percent of businesses supported identify as SEDI businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe program will work with a range of community lenders\u2013 including CDFIs, credit unions, and Minority Deposit Institutions \u2013 to provide them with an additional source of liquidity and client acquisition while reducing challenges with data collection and reporting.\n\n\"CDFIs are often a financial lifeline for small businesses that otherwise go unbanked,\" said Kristen Scheyder, Senior Vice President at Citi Foundation. \"Citi Foundation\u2019s $10 million grant to Calvert to support the design and launch of the Access program demonstrates our commitment to helping expand community lenders\u2019 ability to strengthen local economies through needed small business loans.\"\n\n\"Access to affordable capital continues to be the number one need of small businesses,\" said Gustavo Perez, Vice President of Philanthropy and Community Impact at Wells Fargo. \"Programs like Access help expand community lenders\u2019 ability to strengthen local economies by ensuring they have the resources to increase lending to small businesses. We are proud to provide philanthropic support to Calvert Impact Capital to enable them to leverage the State Small Business Credit Initiative to put more capital in the hands of small businesses so they can start, operate, and expand.\"\n\nMore information about the Access program can be found on the Calvert Impact website.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Thursday as Wall Street was slapped with profit-taking even as inflation showed signs of cooling, with focus now turning to the second quarter earnings season.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,641.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat at 20,444.25 points by 19:03 ET (23:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,123.0 points.\n\nSoft CPI data ramps up Sept rate cut bets\n\nConsumer price index inflation read softer than expected for June, which saw investors ramp up bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates from September.\n\nHeadline CPI grew a slower-than-expected 3% year-on-year in June, while core CPI grew 3.3%, also less than expected.\n\nThe reading saw traders pricing in an over 85% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, a sharp jump from the 65% chance seen a day ago, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nBut the softer inflation, coupled with other middling readings on the U.S. economy in recent weeks sparked some concerns that growth was cooling.\n\nWall St sinks as tech faces profit-taking\n\nBut despite increased optimism over interest rate cuts, Wall Street indexes retreated from record highs on Thursday, hit chiefly by outsized losses in technology shares.\n\nThe losses came as investors collected a measure of recent profits in the sector, which had steadily risen in recent weeks on hype over artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 0.8% in aftermarket trade following a 5.6% slump on Thursday.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2% after tumbling 8.5% after a report said the firm\u2019s unveiling of autonomous taxis will be delayed to October from August.\n\nTech was the biggest weight on Wall Street on Thursday, after driving a stellar stock rally over the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% to finish at 5,584.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite slid 1.9% to 18,288.62 points.

Next week, majors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are set to report earnings on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFocus will largely be on whether corporate earnings were impacted by high interest rates and sticky inflation, which were seen causing some cooling in the U.S. economy in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady as Wall St falls after CPI data; Q2 earnings awaited\n\nBoeing nearing deal to sell 777X jets to Korean Air, sources say\n\nGlobal EV sales up 13% in June, down 7% in Europe, Rho Motion says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2nd-Quarter Earnings Season Preview",
        "content": "U.S. markets have been rising in anticipation of second-quarter earnings season, which unofficially kicks off Friday with results from the big banks.\n\nThe good news is earnings are expected to continue to be a bright spot through the second half of the year. What's especially bullish as we enter the second-quarter earnings season is the fact that Wall Street expectations have barely budged since the end of the first quarter. According to FactSet, S&P 500 earnings per share growth is anticipated to hit 8.80% for the second quarter. This is down just ever so slightly from the 9% expectation on March 31.[1] This is pretty atypical as far as estimate revisions go. In response to more conservative corporate guidance, analysts tend to pull their estimates down by 3% to 4% in the weeks ahead of an earnings season. The fact analysts mostly kept their estimates as is suggests corporations believe they can surpass these expectations. If growth comes in at 8.80%, it would be the highest growth rate in over two years, that's with eight of the 11 sectors anticipated to show year-over-year increases.\n\nOn the flipside, however, while earnings growth is expected to be a highlight of the second-quarter season, revenue estimates still remain a little light. Large corporations continue to cost cut their way to profit growth, which is a fine short-term solution, but soon investors will want to see a return to robust revenue growth driving earnings. Second-quarter revenue growth is expected to come in at 4.60%.[2] Analysts have also barely touched that estimate, down from 4.70% expected on March 31, but it is important to note that first-quarter 2024 saw a trend of more revenue misses than the historical average. In the first quarter, only 60% of S&P 500 names surpassed analyst expectations, well below the one-, five- and 10-year average beat rate.[3]\n\nUp this week: Big banks\n\nIn its usual fashion, second-quarter earnings season will begin with the big banks, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), reporting on Friday. While these banks struck a bit of a cautious note in their first-quarter reports, recent commentary has sounded a bit more upbeat.\n\nWhile similar headwinds were still in play for the second quarter, investment banking showed signs of rebounding. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason recently spoke on the uptick of the investment banking business thanks to strong M&A activity,[4] while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) President John Waldron noted that deal-making was making a comeback thanks to investments in AI.[5] Overall, we noted 84 initial public offering announcements in the second quarter, the strongest pace since third-quarter 2022 saw 112 such announcements. Merger and acquisition announcements for the quarter totaled 98, just about with the prior three quarters, but otherwise a little light in the context of the last four years.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors seem to like the banks as well, given that stock prices rose steadily throughout the quarter. Of the six big banks, JPMorgan Chase has seen the largest gains year to date of 35%, followed by Citigroup at 25% and Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all just above the 20% mark. This is in comparison to the S&P 500, which is up around 18% on the year. 2nd-Quarter Earnings Season Preview\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 16, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,445 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 46% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 10,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "It is becoming clear that 2024 is a very different year than the last year. Although we\u2019re still in the middle of a bull market, it is more of a broad-based rally, higher this time than it was in 2023.\n\nBack then, the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for virtually all of the market\u2019s gains. This year, although most of those companies are still performing well \u2014 and some like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue to do very well \u2014 the seven tech giants are not having the same impact.\n\nWell, on the S&P 500 they are, because it is a market capitalization-weighted index. Six of the Magnificent Seven are worth $1 trillion or more (only laggard Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not). That means their movements affect the index more than they do a price-weighted index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is also why the S&P 500 is up 17% year-to-date and the Dow is up a measly 4%. Yet this offers investors an opportunity. It suggests undervalued Dow stocks may be more prevalent than those on the popular benchmark index.\n\nSo let\u2019s dive into the three companies below that may be some of the best undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is an investment bank in transition. Weighed down by acquisitions in wealth management and installment lending that it thought would diversify its operations, today the financial giant is reorganizing its efforts to concentrate on investment banking, trading, and investment management. It will continue divesting consumer-facing businesses.\n\nGoldman took big writedowns on its home improvement lender GreenSky, which it sold last October. It also scrapped its co-branded credit cards with General Motors (NYSE:GM) while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) terminated its Goldman Sachs card.\n\nThe turnaround effort is working. First-quarter profit exceeded analyst expectations as the investment banking division benefited from increases in underwriting and dealmaking. Last year was a mixed one for mergers and acquisitions. While dealmaking hit a decade low, some of the biggest acquisitions ever took place, including Exxon Mobil\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources. Goldman Sachs was the lead advisor on the $60 billion transaction.\n\nThe investment banker\u2019s stock is up 50% over the past year and Wall Street expects earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years. Trading at just a fraction to those projected growth rates, Goldman Sachs stock is one of the leading undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) has destroyed value for investors for years. Over the past decade, the owner of Post-It Notes and Scotch-brand tape has a total return of just 23% compared to a 190% return by the Dow.\n\nIts malaise culminated in May of this year when this former Dividend King slashed its dividend by more than half. Facing mounting lawsuits over faulty products (made by a company it acquired) and environmental pollution allegations, 3M was forced to conserve cash. But it also spun off its consumer products business Solventum (NYSE:SOLV) to return some value to shareholders and began settling the lawsuits against it.\n\nToday, 3M is a much healthier company financially and the markets approve. Shares are up 9% in 2024 which turned the conglomerate into an undervalued Dow stock worth buying. 3M goes for 12 times earnings estimates and a deeply discounted 11x free cash flow (FCF). With a lower dividend payment, 3M can now support the payout. MMM stock deserves renewed consideration by investors.\n\nDow (DOW) DOW Chemical sign outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is fun to write: chemical stock Dow (NYSE:DOW) is an undervalued Dow stock. Shares trade at 12 times earnings estimates, a fraction of sales and 14x FCF. Dow stock, though, is down 5% this year and off 2% for the last 12 months. Shares remain 27% below the all-time high they hit in 2021.\n\nThe tide is turning for the chemicals company. Demand recovered in the first quarter even though sales were down 9% year-over-year. However, they were up 1% sequentially. Chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling told investors, \u201cWe captured improving demand, maintained pricing, and benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs.\u201d As a result, volumes grew and margins expanded.\n\nBecause chemicals are a commodity and their price tends to move in tandem with Brent crude oil prices, Dow should benefit from Brent prices north of $84 a barrel. That is 5% above the price one year ago. The Energy Information Administration forecasts oil to trade around $89 a barrel in the back half of 2024. It does not expect that to change much next year as it forecasts Brent crude at $88 a barrel.\n\nThe higher prices should help Dow improve its capacity utilization. And with lower natural gas prices in the mix now and going forward, the chemicals stock should also benefit as it lowers its feedstock costs. That points to improving profitability and should have investors putting DOW stock on their buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM, SOLV and XOM stock.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Pre Q2 Earnings: To Buy or Stay Clear",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS is slated to release second-quarter 2024 earnings on Jul 15, before the opening bell.\n\nGS stock hit a 52-week high on Jul 10 and is currently trading at a two-year high of $478.89. Should you buy it ahead of its second-quarter numbers? Before we analyze the stock\u2019s investment worthiness, it\u2019s time to look at the company\u2019s historical performance and how it is expected to fare this time.\n\nGoldman has a decent earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with an earnings surprise of 22.78%, on average. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let\u2019s check out how Godman is expected to fare in terms of revenues and earnings this time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $12.68 billion, calling for a 16.4% rise from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nFor quarterly earnings, in the past month, the consensus estimate has been revised 1.9% downward to $8.70. The projection suggests a surge of 182.5% from $3.08 reported in the prior-year quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Goldman Sachs this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nGS has an Earnings ESP of -1.35% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nFactors to Shape GS\u2019 Q2 Results\n\nMarket-Making Revenues: GS is likely to have recorded solid growth in market revenues driven by decent client activity during second-quarter 2024. The likelihood of a soft landing of the U.S. economy, gradually cooling inflation and clarity on the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut path drove the client activity. Volatility was low in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds, and foreign exchange.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimates for market-making revenues is pegged at $5.03 billion, indicating an increase of 15.6% from the prior year\u2019s quarter-reported figure.\n\nInvestment Banking (IB) Fees: Global mergers and acquisitions (M&As) bounced back in second-quarter 2024 after muted performances in the past couple of years. Both deal value and volume witnessed a remarkable comeback driven by solid financial performance, fading recession risks, buoyant markets and expected rate cuts this year. Yet, harsh scrutiny by antitrust regulators and persistent geopolitical tensions have continued to act as headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe IPO market activity was decent in the second quarter on the back of a robust equity market performance. This also drove some activity in follow-up equity issuances. Debt issuance volume was aided by lower yields, a better operating backdrop compared with last year.\n\nA stabilizing macro-environment, along with Goldman\u2019s leadership position in worldwide announced and completed M&As, equity and equity-related offerings and common stock offerings, is likely to have lent it an edge over its peers. Hence, these are likely to have favorably impacted Goldman\u2019s quarterly IB revenues.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB fees of $1.92 billion indicates 34.2% growth from the prior-year quarter\u2019s actuals.\n\nNet Interest Income (NII): A stabilizing macroeconomic backdrop, along with the expectations of the Fed easing interest rates going forward, is likely to have offered some support to the lending scenario in the quarter-to-be reported. The demand for loans, especially commercial and industrial loans, improved from first-quarter 2024, per the Fed\u2019s latest data. Hence, loan growth for Goldman is likely to have been decent.\n\nAs the Fed kept the interest rates at a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5% during the quarter, GS is less likely to have recorded a solid improvement in NII. Also, the inverted yield curve in the June-ended quarter and high funding costs are expected to have put pressure on NII.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII\u2019s revenues is pegged at $1.49 billion, suggesting an 11.4% plunge from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nExpenses: Goldman\u2019s investments in technology and market development expenses for business expansion and a rise in transaction-based expenses due to higher client activity are anticipated to have led to a rise in expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nPrice Performance and Valuation\n\nGoldman outperformed the S&P 500 index in the first half of 2024. The other major finance sector stocks outperforming the index include Citigroup C and JPMorgan JPM.\n\nFirst Half 2024 Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nC and JPM are slated to release second-quarter 2024 numbers on Jul 12.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the value Goldman Sachs offers investors at current levels.\n\nCurrently, GS is trading at 12.44X forward 12 months earnings, above its five-year median of 9.70X. Meanwhile, the industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple sits at 10.55X. The company\u2019s valuation looks somewhat stretched compared with its range and the industry average.\n\nPrice-to Earnings (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Consideration: Risk and Reward Trade-Off\n\nGoldman is well-positioned for future growth on the back of its focus on core operations, opportunistic buyouts and improving demand in global deal-making. A deepening market presence and solid liquidity will further aid financials. The company is actively engaged in strategic initiatives, which will boost its IB and trading businesses.\n\nGS also continues to reward shareholders handsomely.\u00a0 As it cleared the 2024 stress test, the company intends to increase its quarterly dividend by 9% to $3.00 per share. In the past five years, the company hiked dividends four times with an annualized growth rate of 24.42%. Currently, its payout ratio sits at 43% of earnings.\n\nMounting expenses due to investment in technology and business expansion will limit the company\u2019s growth. Also, adverse impacts from prolonged higher rates, leading to high deposit costs will keep hampering the top line.\n\nConclusion\n\nDecent client activity, improving lending scenario and lower volatility in the capital markets paint a favorable picture for Goldman. A stabilizing macro-environment, along with its top rank in worldwide announced and completed M&As, will offer support to fee-based revenues.\n\nPotential investors should exercise caution over concerns related to elevated expenses and high funding costs.\n\nAs GS is trading at a two-year high, it reflects investors\u2019 highly bullish expectations from the second-quarter results. Near-term volatility is likely to occur as markets process and adjust to the revisions. The company\u2019s stretched valuation warrants a pause.\n\nWhile Goldman\u2019s solid fundamentals and strong prospects remain promising, investors should not rush to buy the stock. To get clarity and possibly an appealing entry point, those interested in adding it to their portfolios might be better off waiting until after the quarterly results are out.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +6.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $8.70 per share, indicating a change of +182.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.70 points to a change of +60.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $40.37 indicates a change of +10% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Goldman is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Goldman, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.58 billion and $53.84 billion estimates indicate +11.5% and +4.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.26%. The EPS surprise was +35.6%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGoldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Some thin trading activity could be ahead for the broader markets but don\u2019t count out the red-hot momentum plays, many of which could continue to inch closer to a breakout. Of course, July isn\u2019t exactly the most action-packed month for stocks, especially as many investors, traders and other market participants look to take some much-needed time off while it\u2019s hot.\n\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) on the minds of many growth-hungry investors, perhaps the companies with less-appreciated AI stories can stay hot even as trading activity cools down just a bit. Also, let\u2019s not forget other stocks in this market are faring well without the tailwind of AI.\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll examine three underpriced stocks (and perhaps even slightly undervalued) that may be in a spot to make a run for new heights in the coming weeks. Though lacking in timely catalysts, the following seem like worthy additions to the mid-summer radar.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nCorning (NYSE:GLW) was still a relatively underpriced and under-the-radar AI beneficiary when I first highlighted the name back in early June. After reporting an incredible quarter, the Gorilla Glass and optical cable maker is now in the hot seat, soaring more than 16% in the last week on the back of better-than-expected demand.\n\nWith raised guidance for the second quarter (revenue expected to come in at $3.6 billion, up from $3.4 billion) and new innovations that could solidify the company\u2019s positioning in the data center boom, GLW stock seems to have enough wind at its back to power even more big beats over the coming year.\n\nAs builders of data centers continue buying the latest Corning equipment, perhaps the second-quarter sales guide raise will prove too conservative. Either way, I\u2019d be unsurprised if Corning shares break out to new 10-year highs as soon as this month. The stock is less than 3% from the level.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has already broken out in a big way, with shares now up over 7% from highs hit back in July 2021. Indeed, AMZN stock is a tad later than its Magnificent Seven peers to break out to new highs. Still, I view Amazon as having more than enough growth drivers (notably in AI) to continue powering the latest surge.\n\nMore recently, the $2 trillion e-commerce and cloud giant pulled the curtain on its latest semiconductor innovation: the Graviton4 CPU. The chip, based on the ArmHoldings (NASDAQ:ARM) architecture, makes considerable performance gains over its predecessor and could help Amazon lower its dependence on third-party chipmakers in the data center.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Amazon continues innovating on AI-capable software and hardware, I find it tough to pass on shares as they look to extend the massive bull run that started in January 2023.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeradyne (NASDAQ:TER) stock has been a huge winner so far this year, with the stock up an astounding 43% year-to-date. With Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently adding the industrial automation solutions provider to its \u201cconviction list,\u201d investors may be looking for a summertime breakout for the name. Specifically, Goldman noted that the firm may be on track to enjoy a \u201csales inflection.\u201d\n\nAt writing, TER shares aren\u2019t too far off from new highs, down just over 6% from its January 2022 peak. Even at more than 60 times trailing price-to-earnings, TER stock stands out as an intriguing breakout candidate with numerous underrated catalysts that could help power a move.\n\nThe company\u2019s new industrial-focused autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), like the MiR1200 pallet jack, are helping advance the robotics boom in the warehouse. For such impressive innovations, you can expect to pay a rich premium. Arguably, the current premium may not be rich enough.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon.

        "title": "Is GHYAX a Strong Bond Fund Right Now?",
        "content": "Any investors hoping to find a Muni - Bonds fund could think about starting with Goldman Sachs High Yield Municipals A (GHYAX). GHYAX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.\n\nObjective\n\nWe classify GHYAX in the Muni - Bonds category, an area rife with potential choices. Muni - Bonds funds focus their investments on debt securities issued by state and local governments. These are typically used to pay for the construction of infrastructure, the operation of public schools, and other municipal functions. These securities can come in the form of revenue bonds, which are backed by taxes, as well as \" general obligation \" bonds that are not backed by a defined source. Investors are usually interested that come with most municipal bonds, which can be especially important for those in higher tax brackets.\n\nHistory of Fund/Manager\n\nGoldman Sachs is based in New York, NY, and is the manager of GHYAX. The Goldman Sachs High Yield Municipals A made its debut in April of 2000 and GHYAX has managed to accumulate roughly $393.06 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals.\n\nPerformance\n\nInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. GHYAX has a 5-year annualized total return of 1.21% and is in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.92%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.\n\nIt is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.\n\nWhen looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. GHYAX's standard deviation over the past three years is 9.53% compared to the category average of 13.37%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 9.52% compared to the category average of 14.1%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.\n\nThis fund has a beta of 0.99, meaning that it is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, GHYAX has a positive alpha of 0.94, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nRatings\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that 43 % of the bonds in this fund are not ranked, so take the average quality level with a bit of caution.\n\nExpenses\n\nCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, GHYAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.85% compared to the category average of 0.94%. GHYAX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.\n\nWhile the minimum initial investment for the product is $1,000, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $50.\n\nFees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOverall, Goldman Sachs High Yield Municipals A ( GHYAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Goldman Sachs High Yield Municipals A ( GHYAX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.\n\nThis could just be the start of your research on GHYAXin the Muni - Bonds category.

        "title": "Is GAMDX a Strong Bond Fund Right Now?",
        "content": "If you have been looking for International Bond - Emerging funds, it would not be wise to start your search with Goldman Sachs Local Emerging Markets Debt A (GAMDX). GAMDX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5 (Strong Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.\n\nObjective\n\nWe classify GAMDX in the International Bond - Emerging category, an area rife with many investment choices. International Bond - Emerging funds focus on fixed income securities from emerging nations from around the globe. This usually results in exposure to economies like China, Brazil, India, South Africa, and Indonesia, just to name a few. Funds here offer geographic diversification, but they can also introduce currency risk into the picture as well.\n\nHistory of Fund/Manager\n\nGoldman Sachs is based in New York, NY, and is the manager of GAMDX. Goldman Sachs Local Emerging Markets Debt A made its debut in February of 2008, and since then, GAMDX has accumulated about $2.71 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund is currently managed by Kay Haigh who has been in charge of the fund since July of 2020.\n\nPerformance\n\nInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 0.53%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of -1.8%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.\n\nIt is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge.

The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 12.27% compared to the category average of 14.57%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.\n\nWith a beta of 0.21, this fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, GAMDX has a positive alpha of 1.23, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nExpenses\n\nFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, GAMDX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.23% compared to the category average of 0.97%.

        "title": "Inside Goldman Sachs' expanding but risky financing engine",
        "content": "By Saeed Azhar and Paritosh Bansal\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs bet put in place in 2021 on lending to private funds has helped drive record revenues in fixed-income financing. Now, the Wall Street bank is pushing even deeper into the growing but risky market.\n\nThe fund finance unit, housed in the bank's global banking and markets division, lends money secured by different types of assets to private equity and other funds. Such assets, however, can be hard to value and trade, and some loan products are yet to be tested in a downturn, making lending against them risky.\n\nGoldman has revealed few details about the business, but interviews with bank executives and industry experts provide a window into the unit and its operations.\n\nThe fund finance unit is part of the bank's efforts to put the Wall Street bank back on a sustainable growth path after an ill-fated foray into consumer businesses, where the bank lost billions of dollars.\n\nThe business has grown rapidly in three years, with one source familiar with the matter saying it has gone from contributing very little to becoming \"a very meaningful part of the firm's profitability.\" The source did not want to be identified because the details of the business are not public.\n\nIn the first quarter, for example, the fund finance unit was a significant contributor to a 31% increase in the bank's Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) financing revenues, the source said. The bank has said the increase was driven by mortgages and structured lending.\n\nGoldman reported a record $852 million in FICC financing revenues in the first quarter, almost double the amount it reported three years ago, when the unit took shape. Reuters was not able to determine exactly how much of the growth was due to fund finance.\n\n\"It's a marketplace that has grown a lot, and we've participated in that growth,\" said Ashok Varadhan, Goldman's co-head of global banking and markets.\n\nVaradhan said Goldman had \"featured more prominently\" in areas from where regional banks withdrew after the banking failures of March last year.\n\nAsked about risks, especially in loans made against the value of private equity funds that are considered the riskiest, he said the bank is \"fairly conservative.\"\n\n\"The amount of leverage that's being put on these loans is fairly low,\" he said.\n\nGoldman reports second quarter results on Monday.\n\nGoldman has identified lending as a major part of its strategy, setting targets to also significantly increase financing it provides to other clients, including private credit and loans to wealthy clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMPLIFY LENDING The unit offers loans against different kinds of assets, ranging from the net asset value (NAV) of a private equity fund and cash commitments from fund investors to real estate and private credit loans.\n\nConcern has been growing in the industry about some of these loans, especially the ones secured by private equity fund's value, called NAV loans, as the higher-for-longer interest rate environment increases stress in private markets. Bankers and analysts said the biggest risk is a potential economic downturn could lead to defaults, in particular of assets that carry a lot of debt.\n\nShana Ramirez, a partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman, who is an expert in fund finance and private credit, said many banks don't offer NAV loans because of these risks.\n\nRamirez said a bank can try to structure the loans \u201cin a way that makes you comfortable, get whatever collateral you can, recognizing that some of these are unsecured. Beyond that, it's really a matter of trusting your sponsor.\"\n\nLARGE CHECKS\n\nFor NAV loans, Goldman has been writing large checks, mostly in the $500 million to $1 billion range, the source familiar with the business said.\n\nBut the source added that the bank provides low loan-to-value NAV loans, typically 5% to 15%. That gives the bank a cushion, as the asset's value would have to drop down to those levels for Goldman to take any losses.\n\nIt also demands other protections during negotiations over terms of the loan. If valuations drop, for example, Goldman has an ability to force the borrowers to remedy it by putting in more equity, the source said. In addition, Goldman is examining whether it can package such loans to sell to investors, such as insurance companies, reducing the risk on its balance sheet, the source said.\n\nTwo years ago, Goldman got a call from a private equity firm that wanted a $1.5 billion NAV line against its $20 billion fund to finance the acquisition of a company, the source said. The private equity firm lost the deal to another sponsor, which raised financing from four private credit providers. But in the end all roads led back to the Wall Street firm. Goldman's client took out the NAV loan anyway, using it to return cash to its limited partners. The private credit funds that had given the loan to the other sponsor were also Goldman's clients \u2013 and the bank ended up providing them leverage as well, the source said.\n\n\"The goal was not to downshift in trading, but really amplify what we're doing on the lending side,\" said Mahesh Saireddy, head of Goldman's mortgage and structured products, who oversees financing activity to private funds.\n\n(Reporting by Saeed Azhar and Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Anna Driver)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs Plans To Launch Tokenization Funds, RWA Marketplace\n\nGoldman Sachs, a 150-year-old financial institution, is reportedly planning to launch three tokenization projects by the end of the year, according to a Fortune report. Details about these projects remain limited, but sources indicate that one will target the U.S. fund sector while another will focus on European debt markets. Additionally, the firm plans to create marketplaces for tokenized assets.\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, Goldman Sachs is focusing on using permissioned networks rather than fully decentralized blockchains like Ethereum, due to regulatory concerns. Mathew McDermott, Goldman's Global Head of Digital Assets, noted that the firm has been working with permissioned blockchain networks since 2021. Goldman Sachs has worked with the European Investment Bank to issue bonds and tokenized a sovereign green bond for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nMcDermott, who has been a strong advocate for digital transformation and blockchain technology, has been a key figure in Goldman\u2019s digital asset initiatives. A 19-year veteran at Goldman, McDermott was instrumental in establishing the bank\u2019s digital asset desk in 2021 and spearheaded the development of its cash-settled crypto derivatives trading products.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 entry into the tokenization arena comes as rival firms like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity are already making notable advances in the \"real-world asset\" tokenization space. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently described tokenization as \"the next generation\" for markets. BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenized fund, BUIDL, recently surpassed over $500 million in assets under management.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Undervalued renewable energy stocks are in the spotlight amid a shift in the global energy mix. The renewable energy industry is forecast to grow 16.8% annually until 2031, illustrating its systematic potential.\n\nDespite the industry\u2019s resilient growth rate, many renewable energy stocks remain undervalued. As such, I decided to embark on a journey to find three best-in-class renewable energy stocks to invest in. Methodologically, my screening process focused on fundamental aspects, valuation multiples and event-based inflection points. Moreover, I backed in technical analysis to ensure complete alignment.\n\nRenewable energy stocks might not be for everyone. However, I believe they contribute to a well-rounded investment portfolio. If you share my vantage point, here are three undervalued renewable energy stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSunrun (RUN) Person holding cellphone with logo of U.S. solar energy company Sunrun Inc. (RUN) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) is a top pick at Soros Fund Management, which recently snapped up 2.08 million of RUN\u2019s shares. Although this is an isolated event, George Soros\u2019s interest is telling, given his firm\u2019s reputation and large following.\n\nFurthermore, Sunrun\u2019s fundamentals seem to have reached an inflection point. For example, the company announced in June that it secured the largest-ever securitization in the solar industry, $886.3 million in funding, illustrating investors\u2019 confidence in its prospects. Moreover, Sunrun has experienced solid fundamental momentum, revealing a 15% increase in customer uptake during its first quarterly, communicating the company\u2019s scalability.\n\nA concern about Sunrun is that it is operating at a net loss. However, blitzscaling is arguably more important than profitability for the time being. Therefore, I think RUN stock is a buy, especially considering its financial market-based dynamics, which include a price-to-book ratio of 0.54x and an $18 per share price target from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) Canadian Solar (CSIQ) logo on the mobile device. Canadian is a company that manufactures photovoltaic solar modules and provides ready-to-use solar power solutions.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanadian Solar\u2019s (NASDAQ:CSIQ) stock is a classic event-driven opportunity. In May, the company revealed that its subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, had secured a $1.4 billion debt facility to aid its expansion venture, which includes constructing several new solar plants in Europe. Additionally, Canadian Solar announced last month that it had opened a new photovoltaic modules assembly plant in Texas, allowing it to produce 20,000 high-power models daily.\n\nCSIQ stock has slumped by nearly 10% in the past month, suggesting investors have yet to price the abovementioned variables. Despite this, rejuvenated systematic support will lend Canadian Solar a helping hand, allowing its recent events to influence its stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike Sunrun, Canadian Solar is profitable and operates at a net profit margin of 2.8%, which I deem favorable. Moreover, CSIQ stock\u2019s price multiples signal deep value. For instance, CSIQ stock has a price-to-sales ratio of merely 0.15x and a price-to-book ratio of 0.41x.\n\nNorthland Power (NPIFF) Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buy\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthland Power (OTCMKTS:NPIFF) is a departure from the solar pure play stocks mentioned earlier in the article. Instead, the company accesses the renewable energy industry by engaging in infrastructure. The firm\u2019s end markets include wind energy, solar, and natural gas. Moreover, Northland Power is geographically diversified, operating in regions such as North America, South America, and Europe.\n\nI\u2019m in favor of NPIFF stock for a few reasons. Firstly, the company and its investors experienced a welcoming surprise earlier this year when BMO Capital reiterated its \u201coutperform\u201d outlook on NPIFF stock. Sequentially, Northland Power released a promising first-quarter earnings report, revealing C$754.92 million in revenue, a 21.4% year-over-year increase.\n\nFurthermore, Northland Power has showcased alluring market-based metrics. For example, the stock has formed a momentum trend by trading above its 10-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. Better yet, NPIFF stock\u2019s price-to-sales ratio of 2.54x is at a five-year discount of about 33%, indicating that NPIFF stock has relative value in store.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Northland Power\u2019s stock is a guaranteed winner, folks. However, don\u2019t be surprised if it skyrockets in the next year!\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs to launch three tokenization projects by end of year, says digital assets chief",
        "content": "As its peers in traditional finance push deeper into crypto\u2014including BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF and Fidelity's trading platform\u2014Goldman Sachs is preparing to make a move of its own. This comes as the 150-year-old banking behemoth is seeing a major uptick in interest from clients, digital assets global head Mathew McDermott told Fortune.\n\nMcDermott says Goldman Sachs intends to expand its crypto offerings, including ambitious initiatives in the red-hot sector of tokenization, where so-called \"real-world assets\" such as money market funds and real estate holdings are issued on public or private blockchains. According to McDermott, Goldman Sachs is set to launch three tokenization projects by the end of the year with major clients, including its first in the U.S.\n\nWhile BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are also testing the tokenization waters, McDermott said the key to success will be creating products that investors want, which is why the bank recently held a digital assets summit in London attended by over 500 clients. \"There's no point doing it just for the sake of it,\" he told Fortune. \"The definite feedback is, this is something that actually will change the nature of how they can invest.\"\n\nDiffering views\n\nAfter a deep crypto winter set off by the collapse of FTX, markets came roaring back this year, buoyed by the January launch of Bitcoin ETFs. According to financial filings, Goldman Sachs took on a key role in the ETF offerings by serving as an authorized participant, meaning it would help with the redemption and creation mechanism for the investment vehicles (including for BlackRock's IBIT ETF).\n\nMcDermott described the launch of the ETFs as a \"renewed momentum in crypto,\" though the view is not shared across his bank. In April, the Wall Street Journalpublished an interview with Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, the chief investment officer for Goldman Sachs Wealth Management, where the financial veteran said that she does not view crypto as an investment asset class and has not seen interest from clients.\n\n\"The nice thing is, about an institution of our size, there are differing views,\" McDermott told Fortune. He said that Goldman Sachs is more active in crypto from an institutional perspective, including trading cash-settled crypto derivatives on behalf of clients, along with its involvement in the ETF markets. \"We've continued to see, certainly this year, an uptick and a broadening in the product suite that clients would like to see available,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTokenization remains a central part of the bank's plans. Goldman Sachs has dabbled in the field, including working on a bond issuance with the European Investment Bank in 2022 and tokenizing a sovereign green bond for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2023, as well as launching the Goldman Sachs Digital Asset Platform in 2023 to facilitate the tokenization of assets.\n\nThe biggest tokenization launch this year has been BlackRock's treasury fund BUIDL, which reached $500 million on Monday and operates on Ethereum, a public blockchain. McDermott said that BlackRock, along with similar funds from Franklin Templeton, targets a retail customer base, while Goldman Sachs is focused more on institutions and would work exclusively with private blockchains due to regulatory restrictions. He said that the bank's aim is to create actual marketplaces for tokenized assets, as well as delivering improvements when it comes to speed and the types of assets that can be used as collateral.\n\nMcDermott declined to provide specifics on the three tokenization projects set to launch this year but said that one is focused on the fund complex in the U.S., and another on debt issuance in Europe.\n\nWith the U.S. presidential election and a potential change in the government's regulatory approach toward crypto just a few months away, McDermott said that the bank's opportunities in the space could expand, including being able to hold spot crypto assets. \"There could be other things that we as a firm would naturally be interested, subject to approval, to do, like execution and maybe sub-custody,\" he told Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A big bank rally is about to be put to the test",
        "content": "The stocks of big banks are outperforming the rest of the S&P 500 this year, and that investor confidence is about to be put to the test.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) all report their second-quarter results this Friday, kicking off another earnings season for the US banking industry. Bank of America (BAC) reports the following Tuesday.\n\nThe stocks of these banks \u2014 the four largest in the US \u2014 have each climbed more than 20% since January, outperforming the S&P 500 (GSPC). That performance is also roughly double the gains of an index that tracks the wider industry, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX).\n\nBig bank investors are optimistic about the ability of the biggest financial institutions to thrive as the Federal Reserve slowly lowers interest rates, as regulators water down a set of new bank capital rules and as Wall Street dealmaking stages a comeback.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s policy path \u2014 which currently is expected to be 1 or 2 cuts in 2024 followed by more in 2025 \u2014 \u201creally bodes well\u201d for the group of big banks over the next year, said RBC Capital Markets bank analyst Gerard Cassidy.\n\nBut the actual results from the big banks during the second quarter are not expected to stun, despite a headline number from JPMorgan that will likely blow away all rivals.\n\nJPMorgan is expected to report a sizable net profit due partly to a pre-tax multi-billion-dollar accounting boost from an exchange of shares in credit card giant Visa (V), but analysts say that won\u2019t grab a lot of attention from market watchers.\n\n\"I think the market will pretty quickly pull that out as sort of an unusual or one time event,\" said Scott Siefers, a large bank analyst with Piper Sandler.\n\nWhere there will likely be more focus is what JPMorgan has to say about a key measure of lending profit known as net interest income. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat profit \u2014 which measures the difference between what banks pay out in deposits and take in from their loans \u2014 is expected to be down from the sequential quarter. Same goes for the other three big banks.\n\nEven the biggest banks have been struggling with this measure as deposit costs stay elevated, loan demand remains weak and the Fed takes longer than expected to bring interest rates back down.\n\n\"Investors are hoping to see that net interest income for the second quarter will, ideally, be the trough for big banks this year,\" Siefers added.\n\nThe results from the big banks are also likely to reveal the cautionary stance these lenders are taking on credit as higher rates pose more challenges for their borrowers.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew provisions set aside to cover future loan losses at the big four banks are expected to rise 26% from last quarter. By comparison, the pace of loan loss provisions across all commercial banks began to stabilize earlier this year, rising 0.30% over the quarter, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\nWhere results should be considerably brighter are within the Wall Street operations of these big banks as dealmaking stages a comeback from poor performances in 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe big four banks along with Wall Street specialists Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are all expected to show sizable jumps \u2014 an average of more than 30% \u2014 in investment banking fees compared with a year ago. Goldman and Morgan Stanley report their earnings on Monday and Tuesday. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. REUTERS/Mark Stockwell (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe big event that all banks are waiting for is when the Fed finally decides to start lowering rates from a 23-year high. The current market bet is that it could happen as early as September.\n\nFor smaller regional banks, the sooner rate cuts come the better. They are more reliant on lending income and thus have been hit harder by a drop in net interest income across the industry. They are also more exposed to the weaknesses in the commercial real estate market.\n\nInvestors have pushed down the stocks of various regional and small banks this year as new problems or concerns surface.\n\nIt happened last week after Dallas bank First Foundation (FFWM) announced a $228 million infusion from new investors to help it reduce its concentration of multifamily apartment loans.\n\nIt also happened in June following an analyst report calling out debt held by Bank OZK (OZK), and in May when a short seller targeted Axos Financial (AX) over the quality of its property loans.\n\nCommercial real estate worries first ignited at the start of this year when New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) set aside a surprising amount of money in case of loan losses in part to rent-regulated apartment complexes in the New York City area.\n\nNYCB's stock plummeted but it was able to calm the market with an emergency equity infusion from a group that included former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAll of this turmoil has \"subdued investor expectations\" for regional banks, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala said.\n\nInvestors will be on the watch for more vulnerabilities as many mid-sized institutions report in the coming weeks.\n\nFor these lenders \u201cthe bull case is that their actual credit losses will be significantly lower than what is being priced into their stocks,\u201d Chris McGratty, a regional bank analyst with KBW told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut the institutions that rely heavily on commercial real estate lending aren\u2019t likely to be given the benefit of doubt until the credit cycle has come full circle, McGratty added.\n\nAn index tracking regional bank stock prices (KRE) has fallen more than 7% since the beginning of the year.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco started the sale of triple-tranche dollar debt, extending the oil-rich kingdom\u2019s debt spree as it brings in cash to help fund projects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC\u2019s Owner NYC Penthouse Sells for $135 Million in Priciest Deal Since 2022 Asia\u2019s Richest Banker Gets Caught in Adani-Hindenburg Crossfire\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest oil exporter is selling dollar bonds for the first time since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt has 10-, 30- and 40-year maturities, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified. Initial pricing thoughts, announced after calls with investors, are at about 140, 180 and 195 basis points over treasuries for the three tranches respectively.\n\nAramco is seeking to raise at least $3 billion, and may increase the size depending on investor demand, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s government and affiliated companies have borrowed vast amounts this year, topping China as the biggest issuer of international debt among emerging markets. The government, which needs funds to help cover an expected budget shortfall resulting from an ambitious economic diversification plan, has accounted for more than half of the total debt sold by Saudi entities this year.\n\nAramco sold its first dollar bond in 2019 and followed with 50-year debt in 2020. It issued dollar-denominated Islamic notes in 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company hired banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and SNB Capital to manage the latest bond sale, which may price later on Wednesday.\n\nThe oil producer is a big part of the kingdom\u2019s cash flow plans. In June, the Saudi government offloaded an $11.2 billion stake in the company and Aramco\u2019s massive dividend payouts \u2014 the biggest in the world \u2014 also help fill state coffers.\n\nIn May, the company maintained its $31 billion quarterly dividend payout to the Saudi government and other investors despite lower profit. Its free cash flow \u2014 funds from operations minus capital expenditure \u2014 of $22.8 billion in the period was less than the total payout.\n\nAramco is likely to use the funds to refinance existing borrowings and contribute to its investment program. The company is expanding natural gas production at home including $25 billion of contracts for the Jafurah project. It\u2019s spending billions to maintain oil output and pursuing acquisitions overseas, including tapping into LNG supply in the US and agreeing to take a share in an automotive joint venture.\n\nStory continues\n\nChief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed said in February that the company would sell long-dated debt this year as financial markets improve and the company looks to leverage its massive balance sheet. The plan to issue long-maturity bonds shows Aramco is confident it can remain relevant well past the middle of the century even as the energy transition raises questions over future oil demand.\n\n--With assistance from Hannah Benjamin-Cook.\n\n(Adds details on pricing in second paragraph, background throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Q1 Rundown: ICF (NASDAQ:ICFI) Vs Other Defense Contractors Stocks\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q1 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at ICF (NASDAQ:ICFI) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 13 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and while some of the defense contractors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 1.8% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nICF (NASDAQ:ICFI)\n\nOriginally founded as Inner City Fund, ICF International (NASDAQ:ICFI) delivers consulting and technology services in health, environment, and infrastructure.\n\nICF reported revenues of $494.4 million, up 2.3% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 1.3%. Overall, it was a very good\u00a0quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nCommenting on the results, John Wasson, chair and chief executive officer, said, \"This was a record first quarter for ICF. Revenues increased 2% year-on-year, however, adjusting for the divestiture of our commercial marketing business lines during 2023, first quarter revenue increased 9% year-over-year. This strong performance was led by robust growth in revenues from commercial energy clients and supported by solid revenue growth from government clients.

It was a stunning quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.

It was a weak quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings and organic revenue estimates.\n\nMercury Systems had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand\u2019s central bank kept interest rates unchanged for an eighth straight meeting and said tight monetary policy may be curbing demand more strongly than expected.

It reiterated that policy needs to remain restrictive, but added that the extent of restraint will be tempered as inflation slows.\n\n\u201cA range of business and consumer surveys, and higher frequency spending and credit data, all point to declining activity,\u201d the RBNZ said. Committee members \u201cdiscussed the risk that this may indicate that tight monetary policy is feeding through to domestic demand more strongly than expected,\u201d it said.\n\nThe economy is showing signs of a deepening slump, with gross domestic product expected to have resumed its decline in the second quarter. The RBNZ in May projected it won\u2019t start reducing rates until the third quarter of 2025, but investors and most economists predict it will pivot later this year.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar fell 0.6% to 60.89 US cents immediately after the decision, erasing an earlier gain. The yield on policy sensitive two-year bonds fell eight basis points to 4.67% as traders increased bets on rate cuts starting later this year.\n\n\u201cRestrictive monetary policy has significantly reduced consumer price inflation, with the Committee expecting headline inflation to return to within the 1-3% target range in the second half of this year,\u201d the RBNZ said.\n\nCentral banks globally are focused on how quickly inflation is slowing and when they can begin easing. The US Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting before year-end. Australia\u2019s central bank, on the other hand, continues to signal a possible rate hike, with inflation proving stickier than anticipated.\n\nThe RBNZ\u2019s latest forecasts in May show inflation falling below 3% in the final quarter of this year but not returning to its 2% goal until mid-2026. Inflation slowed to 4% in the first quarter, the weakest reading in almost three years, but a gauge of domestically generated inflation barely slowed to 5.8%.\n\nAll economists surveyed by Bloomberg think the RBNZ\u2019s next move will be a cut, though there is a wide range of views on the timing \u2014 from as soon as August this year to as late as the first quarter of next year.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Matthew Burgess.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era The Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Goldman Sachs (GS) standing at $472.83, reflecting a +1.72% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.07% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.13%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.14%.\n\nThe the stock of investment bank has risen by 2.48% in the past month, leading the Finance sector's loss of 5.5% and undershooting the S&P 500's gain of 4.34%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Goldman Sachs will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on July 15, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $8.70, marking a 182.47% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $12.68 billion, reflecting a 16.42% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $36.63 per share and a revenue of $51.58 billion, demonstrating changes of +60.17% and +11.52%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 CEO was seen as a dead man walking. A year later, the \u201cDavid Solomon\u201d era is being hailed as a success",
        "content": "Less than a year after critics were calling for David Solomon to step down from Goldman Sachs, the once maligned investment bank is now considered a \u201cbig success\u201d under its CEO, according to an analyst note.\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs are up about 21% year- to-date and have gained nearly 53% since the end of October, according to a July 7 research note from Devin Ryan, managing director and senior research analyst at Citizens JMP. This beats the S&P 500, which has risen about 17% so far this year and is up 33% since October.\n\nGoldman\u2019s global banking & markets, or GBM, unit has gained more market share than any large bank peer, while the bank has significantly grown its durable revenue streams. The stock has appreciated 106% since Solomon's first day as CEO on October 1, 2018, Ryan said in the note.\n\nGoldman has increased market share for global banking and markets by about 350 basis points, which Ryan said is the biggest gain in its peer group. Ryan declared that the \u201cDavid Solomon era\u201d at Goldman was a big success and boosted his price target to $525 from $460, according to the note. On Tuesday, Goldman\u2019s stock closed up nearly 2% to $473.49 while Its market cap stood at about $153 billion.\n\nGoldman has suffered through some very public bumps. The investment bank reorganized in 2022 and stepped back from its foray into consumer banking. This led to the sale of specialty lender Greensky to Sixth Street and the departure of Stephanie Cohen, a key Solomon lieutenant and once one of the most powerful women at Goldman. (The move into consumer banking was costly. Goldman in January 2023 disclosed that it had lost about $3 billion tied to the business, according to the New York Times.)\n\nGoldman also laid off thousands of workers last year as the investment bank, a well-known M&A advisor, dealt with the continued slowdown in deals. Then, there was the negative press which quoted Goldman\u2019s normally closed-mouth partners complaining about Solomon\u2019s hard driving personality and his side hustle as DJ.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, every step wasn\u2019t perfect (e.g., consumer business retrenchment), but when looking at the execution in totality, the past handful of years have been a big success by our measure,\u201d Ryan said in an email to Fortune.\n\nMany people missed the underlying momentum of Goldman\u2019s key businesses, Ryan said. This includes leading market share gains in global banking & markets, rapid fundraising, and broader growth within its asset & wealth management unit, which was much stronger than the results reflected given the abnormally challenging operating environment in 2022 and 2023, Ryan said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlternatives to be major Goldman driver\n\n\u201cAs the operating environment begins to recover, the market is waking up to the firm\u2019s potential today (also reflected in the current record share price), and we still see more room from here as we expect GBM market share gains will continue and for the AWM segment to experience a sharp acceleration in earnings as market conditions improve and recently raised alternative assets increasingly earn management and incentive fees at high margins,\u201d Ryan noted.\n\nRyan expects the investment bank\u2019s asset & wealth management business to contribute more to Goldman\u2019s top and bottom lines, according to the note. Goldman\u2019s alternatives platform, which includes private equity and private credit, is also anticipated to be a major driver, he said. Goldman has raised $265 billion in Alts AUM since 2019, bringing firmwide Alts AUM to about $500 billion, Ryan said. (Goldman Alts AUM was $456 billion as of Sept. 30, 2023, according to the firm\u2019s website.)\"Goldman Sachs has been a great story over the past several years, and we still see runway ahead as the capital markets \u2018normalize\u2019 and the value of its Asset & Wealth Management business becomes more evident to the market as earnings power accelerates materially,\u201d Ryan said in the note.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 In Review: General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) Vs Peers\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q1 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 14 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.2%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the defense contractors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 1.6% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD)\n\nCreator of the famous M1 Abrahms tank, General Dynamics (NYSE:GS) develops aerospace, marine systems, combat systems, and information technology products.\n\nGeneral Dynamics reported revenues of $10.73 billion, up 8.6% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 4.2%. It was a mixed quarter for the company.\u00a0General Dynamics blew past analysts' revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its backlog fell short Wall Street's estimates. General Dynamics Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 4.2% since the results and currently trades at $280.47.\n\nRead our full report on General Dynamics here, it's free.\n\nBest Q1: Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC)\n\nResponsible for the development of the first stealth bomber, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) specializes in providing aerospace, defense, and security solutions for various industry applications.\n\nNorthrop Grumman reported revenues of $10.13 billion, up 8.9% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 3.8%. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues Northrop Grumman Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 8.1% since the results and currently trades at $436.\n\nIs now the time to buy Northrop Grumman?

It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' earnings and organic revenue estimates.\n\nMercury Systems had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group.

        "title": "Hot Stocks: 3 Contrarian Upgrades Signaling Major Trend Reversals",
        "content": "Contrarian stock upgrades might help you capitalize on this year\u2019s AI-inspired market rise.\n\nRegarding the prospects of a Federal Reserve rate reduction, the S&P 500rose 14.5% in the first half of the year, driven by technology and communication, which gained 28.2% and 26.7%, respectively. Big-cap growth stocks did well, at 20.7%, while smaller-cap stocks rose slightly.\n\nValue-conscious investors may uncover contrarian stock upgrades that surge against market sentiment, presenting possibilities that have not taken advantage of the 2024 market rally. These upgrades are cheaper than industry titans like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which gained 155% in the first half of 2024 because of rising demand for GPUs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPlus, contrarian stock recommendations against market sentiment are worth considering since experts aren\u2019t always right. Experts anticipated a flat or slightly positive S&P 500 return in 2024. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicts a 6% rise to 4,700. With the S&P 500 at 4,500, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) also expected a flat return.\n\nHowever, the U.S. economy beat expectations; the S&P 500 exceeded 5,500 without concluding the year.\n\nAmid these market happenings, we\u2019ll look at corporations with mixed outlooks recently receiving contrarian stock upgrades, sparking fresh research for these ailing tech titans to benefit from the market rebound.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR), recognized for its ties to the U.S. military and intelligence, is rated \u2018Hold\u2019 based on 13 ratings. The company\u2019s average price target is $22.55, which suggests a 17% downside potential from the present $27.23.\n\nHowever, Argus Research, which rates the big data business \u201cBuy\u201d and sets a $29 price objective, disagrees.\n\nAnalyst Joseph Bonner pointed out that 55% of Palantir\u2019s 2023 income came from strong government contracts. Its growing business sector brought in 45%, with 38% coming from outside the US. Bonner pointed out that Palantir is focusing on making money in AI and finding business solutions.\n\nPalantir\u2019s triumphs in government and commercial contracts support the bullish argument. For the third phase of the TITAN program, which develops new military technologies, PLTR obtained a large U.S. Army contract. Palantir also secured a major DoD CJADC2 contract to build its Maven Smart System. Palantir powers Open DAGIR\u2019s worldwide network.\n\nIts AI platform expanded with 600 pilots in 2023, and 70% increased U.S. commercial income. Palantir and Voyager Space have also launched a major AI relationship to use AI systems in space research and defensive technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to attract attention through contracts and partnerships shows market potential; Palantir expects a big rise in revenue, with growth of at least 30% per year until 2025.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) used to be in charge of the chip business, but Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are taking market share away, souring its outlook. INTC is a \u201cHold\u201d according to 31 analyst ratings. Twenty-five say the company should be kept, three say it should be bought, and three say it should be sold. This shows the market\u2019s feelings about Intel, which is falling behind Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThe experts at Wolfe Research upgraded Intel from \u201cUnderperform\u201d to \u201cPeer Perform.\u201d Analysts stressed that growth in server CPUs can\u2019t cover the high costs of Intel\u2019s 5N4Y strategy\u2019s capital and retirement costs by itself. Intel\u2019s manufacturing business won\u2019t break even until 2027, depending on how fast foundries grow. However, Wolfe Research thinks that gross margins will get better in 2025 as Intel buys more tiles and the cost of starting up the business goes down.\n\nAside from the rating, Intel deserves credit for working hard to compete with Nvidia and AMD. The Xeon 6 processors from Intel are the company\u2019s next version of CPUs for data centers. They are fast and made for AI jobs. Intel\u2019s Arc GPU is 50% faster, and its NPU is four times better. It is based on the next-generation Arc Battlemage design. In the AI business, this lets it go up against Nvidia and AMD directly. Also, Intel\u2019s Gaudi 2 and 3 AI processors cost less than Nvidia\u2019s H100 and AMD\u2019s MI300X GPUs, which are excellent for helping the business regain some market share.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) receives a lot of analyst love thanks to its 38% payment processing market share. PYPL now has 13 \u201cBuy\u201d and 16 \u201cHold\u201d recommendations, indicating a mixed outlook.\n\nIt\u2019s part of our contrarian stock upgrade research since Susquehanna upgraded PYPL from \u2018Neutral\u2019 to \u2018Positive\u2019 with a $71 price target.\n\nPayPal hopes to increase market share in small and medium-sized firms making cross-border payments during Christmas shopping via PayPal Checkout with Pay Later and Fastlane. Susquehanna believes PayPal will exceed transaction margin dollars and adjust EBIT dollar predictions in the coming years, and the stock is a suitable entry point.\n\nSimultaneously, PayPal has introduced six AI-powered commerce options to increase revenue: Fastlane\u2019s one-click guest checkout streamlines and boosts shop conversions. PayPal also introduced Smart Receipts, which employ AI to suggest and reward, and Advanced Offers, which target performance-based advertisers.\u200b\n\nPayPal launched the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain stablecoin PayPal USD to boost digital trade. Finally, the new PayPal advertising platform customizes ads using its huge consumer and merchant data.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Shoe manufacturer Birkenstock Holding PLC (NYSE:BIRK) celebrates 250 years in business this year, but the German apparel stalwart still offers plenty of reasons for investors to get excited. With ambitious plans to increase production capacity, controlled expenditures, new products, strong demand, and expansion into new retail settings and markets, BIRK has enticed investors since the company went public last year.\n\nThese reasons may have contributed to Birkenstock\u2019s presence on the most recent iteration of Deutsche Bank\u2019s (NYSE:DB) Fresh Money list for the third quarter. But Deutsche analysts are just the latest in a growing list of analysts across Wall Street to identify BIRK as a potential stock of interest. I share this excitement about BIRK. Below, we\u2019ll take a closer look at why.\n\nProduction Boost and Company Control\n\nBirkenstock has ramped up spending in recent months in a bid to increase its production capacity. The firm has set a goal of doubling production capacity from its Fiscal 2022 levels over the coming few years, although a more exact timeline is not publicly available. Still, this means moving from 29.2 million pairs of shoes made per year to nearly 60 million.\n\nThe company is known for the quality of its products, which is directly linked to its strict control over its supply chain. This not only ensures consistency of production standards as Birkenstock has expanded globally and ramped up capacity but also helps the company keep costs down by allowing it to adjust its materials sources as necessary to match availability and demand.\n\nCapital Expenditures Remain Low\n\nWith all the plans in the works to increase production, Birkenstock has worked hard to control capital expenditures. Executives have forecasted roughly \u20ac100 million in capital expenditures for Fiscal 2024, a figure that should decline in absolute terms in the years to follow. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts agree, as they recently revised capex forecasts for the current fiscal year down to \u20ac100 million from \u20ac117 million. They also expect this number to drop to \u20ac89 million by Fiscal 2026.\n\nWith production increasing and capital expenditures dropping, CapEx as a percentage of sales is expected to fall as well from 5.6% this year to 2.7% in Fiscal 2027. Goldman expects capex as a percentage of sales to equalize to 3.3% by 2034, a sign that Birkenstock could maintain a relatively low level of expenditures, even as it continues to grow.\n\nNew Products Driven by Strong Demand\n\nBirkenstock is known for its cork-based sandals, but the company has recently begun expanding into higher-priced styles as well. It is able to do so thanks to strong demand, reflected by record-high second-quarter revenue and an increase in guidance in the most recent earnings report. Solid demand has also allowed the company to increase its average selling price for products.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany executives now expect Fiscal 2024 revenue to be between \u20ac1.77 and \u20ac1.78 billion, up from previous estimates of \u20ac1.74 to \u20ac1.76 billion. This would mark an increase of 19% compared to the prior year.\n\nDirect-to-Consumer and Asian Market Growth\n\nBirkenstock has adopted a direct-to-consumer sales model that has allowed the company to expand its brand footprint at a faster rate than expected. Still, for an old and established firm, many investors will wonder how much room Birkenstock has to continue broadening its customer base globally.\n\nFortunately, it appears that the company has ample room to grow, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In these regions, Birkenstock reported 42% year-over-year revenue growth in the last quarter, double the growth of both Europe and the Americas. What\u2019s more, this fast-growing part of the world currently accounts for just 11.5% of Birkenstock\u2019s business, suggesting plenty of space for continued expansion.\n\nIs BIRK Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nGiven the factors mentioned above, it\u2019s no surprise that analysts view BIRK as a Strong Buy based on 14 Buy ratings, three Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months. Across the Street, analysts suggest an average BIRK stock price target of $65.53, representing 15.7% upside potential. This is all the more impressive, given that BIRK shares are already up 50.8% in the last 12 months.\n\nConclusion: New Production and Offerings, Controlled Costs, Big Potential\n\nBirkenstock is ramping up production capacity and capitalizing on demand to offer a wider range of products, including at higher price points than usual. It\u2019s able to do all of this while aiming for a trajectory of reduced capital expenditures in the years to come and while capitalizing on the potential for expansion into new areas of the world. These are several of the reasons analysts view BIRK as a Strong Buy at this time.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs has upgraded its economic growth forecasts for the UK after the Labour Party swept to victory in the General Election.\n\nThe investment bank lifted its forecast for the UK\u2019s gross domestic product by 0.1 percentage points to 1.6% in 2025 and another 1.5% in 2026.\n\nEconomists said they expect Labour\u2019s policy plans to give a \u201cmodest boost to demand growth in the near-term\u201d.\n\nThey said: \u201cReforms to the planning system could boost house-building and productivity; higher public sector investment could lift potential output; and closer trade ties with the EU could mitigate some of the costs of Brexit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAt the same time, possible further increases in taxation and reduced net migration could weigh on growth. That said, it will be difficult to gauge the magnitude of the effects of these policies until the party sets out further details on its policy agenda.\u201d\n\nLabour swept to power with at least 412 seats, giving it a majority of more than 170. Sir Keir Starmer is Britain\u2019s new Prime Minister after a landslide victory for Labour (James Manning/PA)\n\nIt was a rout of the Conservatives, who have 121 seats with just two constituencies left to declare a winning MP.\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics said the new Government offers a 0.25 percentage point \u201cupside risk\u201d to its 1.5% year-on-year estimate of growth for the UK, meaning there is more chance of forecasts improving.\n\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon, said: \u201cKeir Starmer\u2019s majority is large enough to allow him to plot a stable policy course, which should boost business investment and attract greater foreign investment.\n\n\u201cHe has a good chance of making major supply-side reforms like cutting planning regulations. But that will all take time to fully implement and impact the economy.\u201d\n\nIt comes after leading City bosses, including those at Britain\u2019s biggest energy firm Octopus, the UK\u2019s biggest house-builder Barratt and retail giant Currys, welcomed the new Prime Minister.\n\nDavid Thomas, chief executive of Barratt, said: \u201cThe country urgently needs more new homes, of all types and tenures.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the new Government to help them build 1.5 million homes across the next Parliament, unlocking planning and helping first-time buyers access affordable finance, ultimately helping more families own a high-quality, sustainable, new home.\u201d",

        "title": "3 Hidden Stock Gems That Wall Street Is Overlooking",
        "content": "No matter your investing style, we all hope to find overlooked stock gems. These are where the biggest gains are made. But finding these stocks can be a challenge. Having access to information investors could only have dreamt of 30 years ago is a double-edged sword. It can be difficult to distinguish between hidden gems and hyped-up junk.\n\nAt times like these, it can be useful to follow analyst sentiment. But, by definition, overlooked stocks are stocks that either analysts ignore, or they\u2019ve turned negative on for the wrong reason(s). For this article, I\u2019m looking at stocks that one or more analysts have downgraded or lowered their price target in the last 60 days.\n\nAnalysts frequently think short-term. Buying the rumor and selling the news is common among this group. However, if you play the long game and you have a suitable risk tolerance, you can find overlooked stock gems like the three listed below.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPure Storage (PSTG) The Pure Storage logo at the entrance to its office in Mountain View, California. PSTG stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nPure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) may seem to be an odd choice for a list of overlooked stock gems. The PSTG stock price is up 73% in the last 12 months and 81% in 2024. That would make the stock more likely to be overvalued than undervalued. And that\u2019s what the analysts seem to believe.\n\nThe company reported a solid earnings report with year-over-year gains on the top and bottom lines. But, in a similar vein to Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), some analysts believe the growth is not enough to justify further stock price growth. In the last 30 days, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) have downgraded the stock, with UBS giving the stock a rare Sell rating.\n\nThe belief is that Pure Storage will have a hard time growing at the aggressive pace needed to justify its valuation. Adding to that concern is the growing competition in the data center space that the company occupies.\n\nNevertheless, analysts are generally bullish on the PSTG stock and have a consensus price target of 9% higher than its current price.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) Paramount Global (PARA) - Analyst Downgrades\n\nIt\u2019s always cause for concern when analysts initiate their coverage with a Sell rating. However, that\u2019s exactly what happened to Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). On June 25, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) initiated coverage on PARA stock with a Sell rating and a $9.50 price target. That comes after Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) downgraded PARA stock to Underweight and slapped a $9 price tag on the stock.\n\nThe issues surrounding Paramount are well-known to anyone following the stock. In the game of musical chairs that is happening in the streaming industry, the company is left without a chair. It can\u2019t find a buyer. The most public rebuke came as talks of merging with its majority shareholder, Skydance, fell through.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that may be changing. PARA stock is moving higher on news that the merger is back on. There are still many obstacles to clear, but if Paramount has a viable place in the streaming landscape, it may become one of the overlooked stock gems of 2024.\n\n2seventy bio (TSVT) Scientists in a lab\n\nSource: Matej Kastelic / Shutterstock\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for overlooked stock gems, penny stocks are a good place to start. That\u2019s the case for 2seventy bio (NASDAQ:TSVT). The cell and gene therapy company has just a $206 million market cap, but it has revenue \u2014 which is something many companies its size cannot claim.\n\nIn this case, the company received FDA approval for Abecma. It\u2019s a cellular therapy for advanced-stage multiple myeloma patients. The company developed the therapy as part of its collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). Better still, 2seventy bio recently received an expanded label for Abecma that may increase revenue.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been enough to placate at least one analyst. On June 6, Goldman Sachs downgraded TSVT stock from a Neutral to a Sell with a new price target of $2. And even with Wedbush maintaining its Neutral rating, analysts only give the stock a $5 price target.\n\nThis isn\u2019t unique for a company that is unprofitable at a time when interest rates remain high. But continued progress towards profitability combined with a rate cut may be enough to make these downgrades look overdone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a long position in PLTR.

        "content": "This year, major U.S. indexes like the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have given investors positive returns of 16.1%, 21.2% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\nInvestors breathe a sigh of relief as various indicators show inflation in the U.S. slowly cooling off. Personal Consumption Expenditures, which is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, edged lower to 2.6% year over year in May compared to 2.7% in April. Since the beginning of 2024, PCE inflation remained unchanged on a monthly basis for the first time in May after rising 0.3% in April. The Consumer Price Index remained unchanged, and the Producer Price Index fell unexpectedly over the same period.\n\nThe report published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis also shows a favorable macroeconomic environment. Personal income grew 0.5% monthly in May compared to 0.3% in April, while personal spending rose 0.2% after rising 0.1% in April. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report shows that job openings in the United States rose 221,000 to 8.14 million in May.\n\nSince the Fed is still looking to achieve its ambitious 2% inflation target, uncertainties remain over the lack of a timeline for interest rate cut initiation even after various Fed-friendly data came in May.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks Set to Surge Higher in Q3 2024",
        "content": "The third quarter is shaping into a pivotal period for the stock market. Economic indicators suggest a potential upswing, with inflation slowly coming down to the Fed\u2019s 2% target range.\n\nThis makes the case for stocks set to surge as a myriad of companies stand out to emerge as potential winners. Amidst all the uncertainty, certain companies can significantly outperform the broader market. These outliers have demonstrated robust financial performance in the last year. Positive tailwinds in the economy also support its growth in the second half of 2024. While the market is always fraught with uncertainty, these three companies have the potential to weather the storm and surge ahead.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack the top three stocks set to surge higher in Q3 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), a leading discount apparel and home goods retailer, has carved a retail niche. It operates several well-known brands, including T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Sierra and Winners. This has allowed it to cater to a broad demographic, leading to strong revenue and earnings growth.\n\nOne of the critical drivers behind TJX\u2019s expected surge is its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences. With inflationary pressures and economic uncertainties, more consumers will likely seek value-oriented shopping experiences. That is the nature of this company\u2019s brand, and its financial performance has been strong despite various headwinds in the economy. Growth continues to accelerate after reporting record revenue, earnings and free cash flow in the 2024 fiscal year. In Q1 FY25, revenue increased 6% year over year to $12.48 billion. Moreover, earnings per share rose 22% yearly to 93 cents per share, with comparable store sales up 3% from the previous year. TJX has emerged stronger than ever after the pandemic, placing it among the top stocks set to surge higher in Q3 2024.\n\nWaste Management (WM) person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR\n\nWaste Management (NYSE:WM), a leader in waste collection, disposal and recycling services, is another stock set to surge in the third quarter of 2024. The company\u2019s strong market position and capital expenditures in renewable natural gas make it well-positioned to outperform.\n\nWaste Management is at the forefront of integrating advanced technologies to enhance operational efficiency. The company\u2019s investments in automation, data analytics and route optimization have significantly improved its service delivery and cost management. Moreover, its recent foray into renewable natural gas is a no-brainer, with significant EBITDA margin expansion potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement is allocating approximately $1.2 billion to invest in 20 new renewable natural gas facilities by 2026, which could accelerate its growth in the coming years.

        "title": "Investors in Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) have seen solid returns of 155% over the past five years",
        "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 125% in five years. On top of that, the share price is up 13% in about a quarter.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Goldman Sachs Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 1.1% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Goldman Sachs Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 155%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Goldman Sachs Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 46% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 21%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Goldman Sachs Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

        "title": "Goldman (GS) &amp; Others Boost Payouts Following Stress Test",
        "content": "Following the clearing of the Federal Reserve's 2024 Stress Test, the biggest U.S. banks took turns returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nLast week, the Fed reported that all 31 banks successfully weathered this year\u2019s stress test. The test evaluates the capacity of the biggest U.S. banks to withstand a significant economic downturn. It is used to determine the most recent minimum capital requirements, which are meant to cushion possible losses.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, and Bank of America Corp. BAC were among those who bumped up payouts.\n\nJPMorgan stated it was raising its quarterly dividend by 8.7% to $1.25 per share. It's the second time the company raised its quarterly dividend this year. JPM also authorized a new $30-billion share repurchase program, effective Jul 1, 2024.\n\nGoldman Sachs's capital plan includes an increase in the common stock dividend from $2.75 to $3.00 per share. This increase is subject to approval by the firm\u2019s board of directors at the customary third-quarter meeting.\n\nBank of America plans to increase its quarterly common stock dividend by 8% to 26 cents beginning in third-quarter 2024.\n\nCitigroup Inc. C, Morgan Stanley and several other large lenders also hiked their dividend payouts.\n\nCitigroup performed better than expected in the stress test this year. The bank was the only one among its peers, which include Wells Fargo, BofA, Goldman, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, to exhibit lower losses in the stress test compared with the previous one.\r\n\r\nAmong the major banks, Citigroup was the only one to witness a decline in its capital ratio requirement for the upcoming year, from 12.3% to 12.1%. The company only raised its quarterly dividend payment to $0.56 per share or 6%.\r\nMorgan Stanley lifted its dividend by 8.8% to 92.5 cents. It also authorized a $20-billion repurchase plan.\n\nIn addition to large banks, several mid-sized lenders like Ally Financial and Fifth Third Bancorp FITB were part of this year\u2019s stress test. Effective 2019, these mid-sized banks (with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion) are tested every alternate year.\n\nFifth Third's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 10.5% as of Mar 31, 2024, significantly exceeds the regulatory minimum of 4.5% plus the stress capital buffer, reflecting strong capital levels.\n\nIn September, FITB proposes to recommend to its board of directors a 2-cent per share increase to the quarterly cash dividend, consistent with its planned capital actions submitted with the Fed. FITB may elect to repurchase shares consistent with its publicly stated CET1 target of 10.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis gave rise to this annual assessment, which covered institutions with at least $100 billion in assets. In an economic scenario regarded to be \u2018severely adverse,\u2019 the group's overall CET1 ratio, considered the highest-quality regulatory capital, would peak at 9.9%, well above the minimum requirement of 4.5%.\n\nThe positive performance of these banks in the test and their subsequent decision to raise dividends and announce share purchases indicate robust financial health and resilience.\n\nThe move is likely to boost investor confidence and could potentially lead to an increase in stock prices.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 Results: Benchmarking Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII)\n\nLooking back on defense contractors stocks' Q1 earnings, we examine this quarter's best and worst performers, including Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 14 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.2%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the defense contractors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 0.8% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nHuntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII)\n\nBuilding Nimitz-class aircraft carriers used in active service, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) develops marine vessels and their mission systems and maintenance services.\n\nHuntington Ingalls reported revenues of $2.81 billion, up 4.9% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates but a miss of analysts' operating margin estimates.\n\n\u201cThe first quarter was a good start to the year,\u201d said Chris Kastner, HII\u2019s president and CEO.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- South Africa\u2019s rand extended a post-election rally after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a new cabinet that he said would prioritize rapid and sustainable growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJustice Department to Charge Boeing, Seeks Guilty Plea from Planemaker Le Pen\u2019s Far Right Wins First Round, Chases French Majority European Markets Rally on Bets Le Pen to Miss Absolute Majority Trump as President or Private Citizen: Why Supreme Court\u2019s Immunity Ruling Is a Test BlackRock Buys Preqin for $3.2 Billion in Private Data Expansion\n\nThe currency led gains among emerging-market peers on Monday, advancing 1.1% to 17.9805 per dollar as of 9 a.m. in Johannesburg. The yield on benchmark bonds fell 14 basis points to 11.24%, heading toward April 2023 lows.\n\nAnalysts at Rand Merchant Bank said Ramaphosa\u2019s retention of Enoch Godongwana as Finance Minister was particularly significant for domestic markets. The reappointment signals a continuation of a prudent fiscal approach and adherence to projections outlined in the February budget and medium-term expenditure framework, they said.\n\nMomentum indicators suggest further rand appreciation is likely this week, the analysts added, predicting the rand would move toward 17.90 per dollar.\n\nGoldman Sees South Africa\u2019s \u2018Fragile\u2019 Coalition Spurring Growth\n\nRamaphosa also included members of the Democratic Alliance \u2014 considered business-friendly by investors \u2014 in his cabinet, with leader John Steenhuisen named agriculture minister. The coalition government was formed after the African National Congress lost its parliamentary majority.\n\nPolitics have whipsawed the rand over the past month.\n\nThe currency weakened toward 19 when it became clear that the ANC would lose more support than initially expected in the May 29 vote. It then rallied below 18 in mid-June after a government of national unity was announced, which excluded left-learning parties whose policy proposals had made investors nervous.

        "content": "The financial services sector in 2024 is poised for growth, driven by robust economic fundamentals and technological advancements. As one of the largest contributors to the U.S. economy, this sector generates significant revenue and employment. Key trends include a resurgence in traditional banking, boosted by rising interest rates and economic recovery, and a notable expansion in fintech. This forms the basis of my article for the best financial services stocks to buy.\n\nDigital innovations, such as blockchain and AI, are transforming financial services, enhancing efficiency and customer experience. Investors are particularly optimistic about companies that leverage these technologies for competitive advantage.\n\nThese are all blue-chip stocks that have great reputations, and I believe that investors will do well by adding them to their portfolios. So with that being said, here are three of the best financial services stocks for investors to consider. These companies won\u2019t stay so attractively priced for long.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW) Charles Schwab headquarters in SOMA district; The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) is a bank and stock brokerage firm\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCharles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) is a leading provider of financial services, offering a comprehensive range of wealth management, securities brokerage, and overall banking services.\n\nIn 2024, Charles Schwab received accolades from U.S. News & World Report and J.D. Power for its top-notch investment platforms, which I think makes it one of those smartest financial services stocks for investors.\n\nSCHW reported $5.12 billion in revenue, up 9.5% year-over-year, with an EPS of 93 cents compared to 77 cents the previous year. Despite missing revenue expectations slightly, EPS exceeded estimates. Key metrics included $7580 billion in total client assets and $150.7 billion in net new client assets, both surpassing analyst estimates.\n\nLooking ahead, Charles Schwab is positioned to continue its growth trajectory by focusing on expanding its customer base and enhancing its service offerings. Analysts anticipate that Schwab\u2019s earnings will grow significantly in the coming year, with expectations for EPS to increase by 35.38% from $3.25 to $4.40 per share.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm. It provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Goldman Sachs reported strong financial results with quarterly net revenues totaling $14.21 billion, and net earnings of $4.13 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.58. Global Banking & Markets led performance with $9.73 billion in net revenues. Asset & Wealth Management contributed $3.79 billion in net revenues, achieving record Management and other fees. The firm also saw assets under supervision rise to a record $2.85 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs continues to maintain a dominant position in the financial services industry by leveraging its extensive global network and diversified service offerings.\u00a0 This includes significant investments in technology to improve trading platforms and wealth management services.\n\nGS is perhaps one of the most blue-chip stocks in the financial services industry, which makes it a strong pick for this article.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) serves clients worldwide, including corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals, through three business segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management.\n\nThe company reported robust financial performance, exceeding analyst expectations. The firm achieved a profit of $2.02 per share, surpassing the estimated $1.66 per share. Total revenue for the quarter rose to $15.14 billion from $14.5 billion a year ago. Investment banking revenue increased by 16% year-over-year, driven by strong equity underwriting which more than doubled in revenue. Fixed-income underwriting also performed well for the second consecutive quarter, supported by increased bond issuance.\n\nFinally, CEO Ted Pick highlighted the firm\u2019s achievement of managing $7 trillion in client assets across wealth and investment management.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been actively expanding its footprint in Asia, particularly in China. The firm has increased its stake in its Chinese securities joint venture to 94%, aiming to capitalize on the growing financial markets in the region.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In contrast, the Reserve Bank of India has signaled its steadfast focus on controlling inflation.\n\nThe rupee remains a favorite in the region with Goldman Sachs citing the attractive carry-to-volume as a key reason. The central bank\u2019s repeated interventions, aided by $650 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, have made the rupee one of the most stable currencies in the world.\n\n\u201cWe expect the RBI to maintain its preference for currency stability, which should keep USD/INR in a relatively tight range, including limiting upside risks to USD/INR,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD: How India\u2019s Rupee Went From Most to Least Volatile: QuickTake\n\nThe less-than-expected mandate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s party in recent elections is unlikely to dampen the sentiment in the near term, Suwanapruti said.\n\n\u201cWe expect macro stability to be maintained in Prime Minister Modi\u2019s new term and it does not change our constructive view on the rupee.\u201d\n\nGoldman is also bullish on Indian bonds with a recommendation to buy the two-year paper. \u201cThe curve is very flat, and therefore, there is not much yield pick-up to go further out the curve.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ten major US and European banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BNP Paribas SA, plan to pay a combined $46 million to end a lengthy legal battle with pension plans that accused them of conspiring to block competitors in interest-rate swaps trading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid China\u2019s Finance Elite Face $400,000 Pay Cap, Bonus Clawbacks Supreme Court Blocks EPA \u2018Good Neighbor\u2019 Ozone Emission Rule\n\nThe payments are part of a deal to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought by investors more than eight years ago, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg. The settlement was filed Thursday in New York federal court, and plaintiffs have asked US District Judge Paul Oetken to preliminarily approve it.\n\nThe banks denied violating any laws and said they sought to avoid the cost of ongoing litigation. Plaintiffs asked the judge to approve the deal. Another bank, Credit Suisse Group AG, settled claims in the case two years ago by agreeing to pay $25 million. Credit Suisse is now owned by UBS Group AG, which was among the 10 involved in the latest settlement.\n\nThe case is part of a wave of litigation brought by public pension plans against big banks accused of colluding across various markets, including interbank rates, currencies and credit default swaps. The financial institutions have faced claims that they kept electronic trading platforms from entering those markets so they could control prices and boost profits.\n\nSome of the cases have led to substantial settlements and reforms. Last year, a platform used by banks in the market for stock lending agreed to make changes to \u201cmaterially decrease the likelihood of future collusion.\u201d Four banks paid almost $500 million to settle that case, but denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe swaps settlement comes after the judge in December denied class-action status to the claims. That essentially gutted the case because investors typically can\u2019t afford bringing lawsuits on their own, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. Before that ruling, BI had predicted the 10 remaining banks would settle for a combined $170 million to $850 million, based on what Credit Suisse had paid.\n\nThe other defendants in the case are Bank of America Corp., Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and NatWest Group.\n\nPension plans and other investors claimed the banks overcharged for interest-rate swaps because of their tight control over an antiquated over-the-counter market, where dealers priced and traded swaps directly with investors outside of centralized exchanges. According to the suit, Wall Street firms prevented the investors from using electronic platforms, which are more transparent, faster and offer better prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors, including pension plans, university endowments and hedge funds, typically use the swaps to hedge against changes to monetary policy when central banks raise or lower interest rates.\n\nThe banks argued that investors weren\u2019t harmed because data shows that a large number of relevant trades didn\u2019t make any money or resulted in a loss. The plaintiffs disputed that any below-zero trades occurred. But the judge, in refusing to grant class-action status, said the \u201cplaintiffs failed to persuasively rebut defendants\u2019 strong showing that there were numerous at-or-below-zero trades during the class period.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the banks prevented the trading of interest rate swaps on services provided by Bloomberg.\n\nThe case is In re: Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litigation, 1:16-md-02704, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Foley Square)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

It\u2019s 23% more than the $2.75 billion Goldman Sachs raised for a similar fund in 2020. In May, Goldman Sachs raised $7 billion to lend to real estate investors and developers, as they believe this market does not have enough funding.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" This real estate fund, offering an 8% yield, makes earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, it benefits from the fact that other investors and fund managers are facing cash shortages and need to sell their shares. This creates good opportunities for Goldman Sachs to buy these shares at potentially lower prices.\n\nGoldman's latest fundraising effort ended six months after competitors Blackstone and Ares Management raised funds focused on property investments. Late last year, Blackstone raised $2.6 billion for its real estate fund, its largest amount yet. Ares raised $3.3 billion for its real estate fund, just under its $3.5 billion goal.\n\nGoldman Sachs says the money in its new fund can be used to buy shares of real estate funds from big investors and support deals where fund managers want to give all investors in a fund a chance to cash out at the same time so they don\u2019t have to sell their assets at subpar prices.\n\nAccording to the company, Goldman Sachs oversees more than $2.8 trillion in assets worldwide as of Dec. 31, 2023. Since its start in 1998, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Vintage Strategies has become one of the largest secondary investors, investing over $70 billion.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs was the \u2018worst hit\u2019 in the Fed\u2019s latest stress test of big banks. Bank of America still lists it as a buy",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday released the results of its annual stress test to see how America\u2019s 31 largest banks would fare in a financial crisis. While the hypothetical recession showed that all banks were well protected against an actual recession, they fared worse on average than in last year\u2019s test.\n\nAccording to a Bank of America report out Thursday, the \u201cworst hit\u201d was Goldman Sachs, with a year-over-year increase of roughly 100 basis points in its stress capital buffer. Bank of America\u2019s analysts said this implies Goldman is exceeding the minimum requirement for globally important banks by approximately 60 basis points, meaning the firm has less excess capital compared with similarly sized peers. Columbus-based Huntington Bank and New York\u2013based Citigroup were among the best-performing.\n\nGoldman shares were down about 2% to roughly $447 at 1:30 p.m. ET, but so far this year the investment bank's stock has been on a tear, up more than 15%.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, Goldman's earnings per share are expected to decrease by 3% as a result of slower than expected buybacks. But more optimistically, a near-term negative for Bank of America\u2019s bullish investment thesis is partly underpinned by potential for an improving baseline going forward.\n\n\u201cDespite this negative which is not thesis-changing, we remain constructive on the stock,\u201d the analysts write. They maintain the stock as a buy with a price objective of $525. Downside risks include a potentially weaker economy and geopolitical issues, with upside risks including stronger capital markets activity.\n\nAn Oppenheimer analyst also still has Goldman listed as a buy, with a target of $517, while a Morningstar analyst prefers a hold recommendation with a $417 target price, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Fortune reached out to both analysts for additional details but didn't hear back at time of publication.\n\nAccording to a Federal Reserve statement, all 31 banks tested, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley, absorbed total projected hypothetical losses of $685 billion and remained above the minimum capital requirements for common equity tier 1 (CET1) banks, or banks considered important to the global economy. Under stress, the aggregate CET1 capital ratio\u2014which cushions against losses\u2014is projected to decline from 12.7% to 9.9%. Though this is a greater loss than last year, the Fed says it\u2019s still within the range of recent tests.\n\nIt's perhaps a bit unnerving to see so many banks perform worse than a year ago, especially given a recent Wall Street Journalreport that many of them were advocating to reduce capital requirements that currently start at 4.5% and increase based on bank size and performance during stress tests. According to the Journal, Goldman spent \"millions\" on an advocacy campaign, and the Financial Services Forum that represents the eight largest U.S. banks asked each of its members to contribute $2 million to another campaign.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe conditions of this year\u2019s test for a \u201csevere\u201d global recession included a 40% decline in commercial real estate prices, a substantial increase in office vacancies, and a 36% decline in house prices. The unemployment rate for the test rose nearly 6.5 percentage points to a peak of 10%, and economic output plummeted.\n\n\"This year's stress test shows that large banks have sufficient capital to withstand a highly stressful scenario and meet their minimum capital ratios,\" vice chair for supervision Michael Barr said in a statement. \"While the severity of this year's stress test is similar to last year's, the test resulted in higher losses because bank balance sheets are somewhat riskier and expenses are higher.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Stock Upgrades From Last Week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 continues to enjoy a solid run as the improving macro environment, coupled with the AI optimism and recent stock upgrades, provides solid support for risk assets.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600, up from the previous target of 5,200.\n\nThis revision by one of the most important financial institutions is attributed to robust earnings growth from five major U.S. technology companies and a higher projected fair value price-to-earnings ratio multiple.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have seen a combined surge of 45%, now representing 25% of the S&P 500\u2019s equity capitalization.\n\nGoldman points to upward adjustments in the 2024 earnings estimates for these tech companies and valuation increases driven by growing investor excitement around artificial intelligence. The broker anticipates that stable real yields by the end of the year and strong earnings performance will justify a 15x P/E ratio for the equal-weight S&P 500 Index.\n\nHowever, the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November poses a significant risk to the S&P 500\u2019s levels, as historically, index volatility has increased leading up to the election. Post-election, the trend typically reverses, with the index recovering to higher levels.\n\nThe news that Goldman lifted its target came as Evercore ISI also revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 on Sunday, setting it to Street-high 6,000, up from 4,750. The firm expects an 8% earnings growth in 2023, bolstered by the potential of the AI \u201crevolution.\u201d\n\nAs valuation models are refreshed to account for higher multiples, we look at 3 hottest stock upgrades from last week.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. Known for its innovative products and strong brand, Nike consistently delivers strong financial performance and growth potential, making it a solid investment choice.\n\nOppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) upgraded its rating for Nike, shifting from a neutral \u201cPerform\u201d stance to a more bullish \u201cOutperform.\u201d Alongside the stock upgrades, the firm also increased its price target for the sportswear giant\u2019s shares from $110.00 to $120.00.\n\nThe stock upgrades come after a period when Nike faced a series of challenges that impacted its sales growth and profit margins. According to Oppenheimer, these difficulties included a mix of external and internal factors that have now been largely accounted for in the company\u2019s current stock price and financial projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the current market valuation of Nike\u2019s shares and the short-term financial expectations have become \u201cderisked.\u201d This term indicates that the risks previously associated with Nike\u2019s performance are now reflected in its stock price, setting a stage for potential recovery.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is a leading retailer of electronics, appliances and tech services. With a broad product range and strong market presence, it attracts investors seeking exposure to consumer electronics and retail sectors.\n\nRecently, UBS (NYSE:UBS) upgraded shares of Best Buy, moving the rating from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cBuy.\u201d Accompanying the stock upgrades, the firm also increased the price target for the retailer\u2019s stock to $106 from the previous $85. The stock upgrades come with a positive outlook from UBS on Best Buy\u2019s potential performance over the next 18 months.\n\nUBS identified several factors that could drive the company\u2019s sales upward. These include an anticipated improvement in housing trends, which typically correlate with appliance sales, and a pending electronics replacement cycle that occurs every four to seven years.\n\nMoreover, the firm expects product innovation, particularly involving artificial intelligence, to boost sales by an average of approximately 200 basis points.\n\nFurthermore, UBS highlighted Best Buy\u2019s expansion into new product categories, such as e-bikes and furniture, as a potential growth avenue. The firm predicts that these elements combined could lead to a robust recovery in Best Buy\u2019s sales in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\nAlcoa (AA) alcola stock\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlcoa (NYSE:AA) is a major producer of aluminum, known for its mining, refining and smelting operations. Its position in the industrial metals sector and focus on sustainability make it an appealing investment for those interested in materials and infrastructure growth.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) revisited its recommendations on mining companies, lifting ratings on Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). Analysts upgraded Alcoa from \u201cEqual Weight\u201d to \u201cOverweight,\u201d setting a new price target of $50.00, up from the previous $36.50.\n\nThe stock upgrades come against the backdrop of disruptions in the global alumina supply, which are expected to keep prices elevated. The broker pointed out that approximately 5.9 million tonnes of alumina capacity disruptions have occurred, accounting for about 10% of the global supply outside of China.\n\nThese disruptions, coupled with China\u2019s increased need to import alumina, are anticipated to tighten the global supply and sustain higher alumina prices than historical averages, potentially reaching $500 in the second half of 2024 and $385 in 2025.\n\nThe situation is also expected to constrain China\u2019s aluminum production, despite the country\u2019s plans to restart some operations. Morgan Stanley\u2019s projections suggest aluminum prices could be supported at $1.22 in the latter half of 2024 and $1.12 in 2025. This outlook appears to be a driving factor behind the positive sentiment on Alcoa\u2019s stock.\n\nAdditionally, Freeport-McMoRan received an upgrade from \u201cEqual Weight\u201d to \u201cOverweight,\u201d with the price target being lifted to $62.00 from the former $49.50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Goldman falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nGoldman is expected to post earnings of $8.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +187.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.59 points to a change of +60% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $40.03 indicates a change of +9.4% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Goldman, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.68 billion and $53.78 billion estimates indicate +11.7% and +4.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.26%. The EPS surprise was +35.6%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGoldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Goldman Signals End of an Era in Private Equity With a Big Hire",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A long era of easy profits in private equity is gone, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is digging in deeper for the harder work ahead.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion China\u2019s Finance Elite Face $400,000 Pay Cap, Bonus Clawbacks YouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor\n\nThat\u2019s the message from Marc Nachmann, the head of the Wall Street firm\u2019s money-management arm, adding his voice to the chorus of industry leaders declaring the buyout business has passed a critical juncture. A period of profits driven by financial engineering and \u201cmultiples expansion\u201d is over, Nachmann said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWhere your returns come from will be much more focused on creating better earnings growth,\u201d he said.\n\nTo that end, Goldman is bringing in corporate muscle, hiring Darius Adamczyk \u2014 the former head of Honeywell International Inc. \u2014 to parachute into portfolio companies that the bank works with and help fix their operations. Even at a bank known for scooping up high-profile advisers, adding a 58-year-old former chief executive officer of a sprawling industrial conglomerate is hardly ordinary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unusual,\u201d Nachmann said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty young to be a retired CEO. And he\u2019s a retired successful CEO who wants to roll up his sleeves and help.\u201d The Wall Street firm\u2019s asset-management business oversees some $140 billion in private equity assets and counts more than 300 portfolio companies under its charge.\n\nThe private equity industry is exiting a long, golden stretch aided by rock-bottom interest rates after 2008. The new normal of higher rates has boosted acquisition costs, crimped valuations and made it harder to unload portfolio companies with attractive returns \u2014 at least without fundamentally improving their operations. A half-century ago, that was in fact the stated mission of private equity pioneers.\n\nInvestors in such funds have been getting uneasy and impatient. According to Nachmann, it\u2019s game over for the kind of operators who raised money and then sat back and watched gains roll in.\n\nNo longer can you \u201cbe the highest bidder, buy the company, sit there, wait for multiple expansion and sell again,\u201d he said. Fund backers dubbed LPs \u2014 for limited partners \u2014 are running the numbers on recent deals to suss out who drove higher returns by growing earnings and who relied on financial hijinks.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to larger LPs, they have some names in mind,\u201d Nachmann said. \u201cSome are higher profile than others.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of Apollo Global Management Inc.\u2019s most senior executives, Scott Kleinman, hit similar notes at a gathering this month, warning \u201ceverything is not going to be OK\u201d and investors shouldn\u2019t expect the type of buyout returns that until 2022 were often buoyed by market exuberance, climbing valuations and financial engineering.\n\nOne metric that has become a proxy for satisfying fund backers \u2014 such as pension systems, college endowment programs and sovereign wealth funds \u2014 is distribution, which tracks capital returning to their pockets. That\u2019s hovering at its lowest level in over a decade, leaving some institutional clients strapped for the cash they need to fulfill missions and fund commitments to new investment vehicles.\n\nGoldman Sachs isn\u2019t often thought of as a key player in that industry, even though its stockpile of alternative assets ranks among the largest. Its investment bank more often grabs public attention.\n\nFor years, the firm has leaned on what it calls the Value Accelerator to pair companies with advisers who have expertise in those sectors. That\u2019s led by the former CEO of Avaya and has tapped executives from places including Coca-Cola Co., Intel Corp. and HP Inc. The key for higher returns in the future, Nachmann said, will be to source good deals and focus on operational improvements.\n\nAdamczyk ran Honeywell from 2017 to 2023. When he stepped down, it had more 90,000 employees, or roughly twice the headcount at Goldman. During his tenure, he strengthened his company\u2019s relationship with the New York-based bank, and its CEO, David Solomon, and his deputy John Waldron count him as a friend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have him join us,\u201d Solomon said in a statement. \u201cI have so much respect for his leadership and the value he created at Honeywell.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Marion Halftermeyer.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History How Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Big banks pass Fed stress test as they fight stricter capital rules",
        "content": "The 31 large US banks that participated in a Federal Reserve stress test would all be able to withstand a severe global recession, a new demonstration of strength as they push back on stricter regulations that would require them to hold more capital.\n\nResults released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending during a two-year scenario where US unemployment climbs to 10%, commercial real estate prices fall 40% and the stock market plunges 55%.\n\nTheir losses in this simulation collectively amounted to $685 billion. That included $175 billion from credit cards, $142 billion from business loans, and nearly $80 billion from commercial real estate.\n\nThe biggest of the group \u2014 JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) \u2014 would all have capital buffers close to double the Fed\u2019s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.\n\nLarger regional banks such as PNC (PNC) and Truist (TFC), Regions (RF), Citizens (CFG) and M&T Bank (MTB) also had relatively higher capital levels than the minimum.\n\nOne regional bank that has struggled this year, New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), was not part of the latest test. It will instead be examined in 2025.\n\n\"The goal of our test is to help to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario,\" Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr said in a release. \u201cThis test shows that they do.\u201d Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBut there were signs of some new weaknesses despite the passing grade applied to all banks.\n\nThe aggregate decline in capital ratios for the banks during a hypothetical downturn was larger than the decline posted by banks in last year\u2019s test, when fewer lenders were examined.\n\n\"The test resulted in higher losses because bank balance sheets are somewhat riskier and expenses are higher,\" Barr added.\n\nHe cited three main factors driving the capital decline: \"substantial\" increases in bank credit card balances, riskier corporate credit portfolios, and less projected income due to higher expenses and lower fee revenue.\n\nResults varied widely between banks. The bank with the highest rate of loan losses under the Fed\u2019s \"severely adverse scenario\" was Discover (DFS), followed by Capital One (COF).\n\nCapital One agreed earlier this year to purchase Discover in a deal that still needs regulatory approval to close.\n\nThe bank with the lowest rate of loan losses was Charles Schwab (SCHW). Capital One headquarters in McLean, Va. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in the aftermath of the last financial crisis. It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010.\n\nStory continues\n\nA law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks\u2019 size, meaning those in the range of $100 billion-$250 billion would be tested every other year.\n\nSome Democrats and regulators last year were critical of that 2018 adjustment. They argued it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not been subjected to a stress test before it failed in 2023.\n\nBanks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks.\n\nSome banks are expected to make announcements late Friday about how much money they now plan to return to shareholders.\n\nAny moves are \"likely to be modest for many\" until lenders get more clarity from regulators about a new set of capital requirements proposed last year, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy.\n\nThe initial version called for raising capital levels an aggregate 16% and banks have spent the last year pushing back aggressively on the plan.\n\nRegulators have signaled that alterations are coming, with Barr saying in May that he expects \"broad and material changes\" to the proposal.\n\nBloomberg reported this week that a new proposal could drop the capital hikes as low as 5%.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

With the quarter closing, analysts up and down the street are busy revising their forecasts and ratings on stocks to determine the securities likely to shine through summer into autumn.\n\nWhile not an exact science, analyst ratings can provide a view of a stock\u2019s sentiment and a sense of where the share price is heading. This can be helpful as investors determine where to allocate capital and which stocks to buy and sell. Right now, analysts and traders are praising certain turnaround stocks as great investments.\n\nHere are three turnaround stocks for massive gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDisney (DIS) A Legion of Studio Successes Will Keep Powering Disney Stock Higher\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) just initiated coverage of Disney (NYSE:DIS) with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and a price target of $125 per share. This implies 23% upside from current levels. Analysts at Goldman Sachs seem to feel that DIS stock has been punished enough. They like that the Mouse House has a hit theatrically released movie with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and cite the company\u2019s competitive moats on both the media side of its business and its popular theme parks.\n\nDisney can use Goldman Sachs\u2019s positive outlook. DIS stock has been in the doldrums for years. The company\u2019s share price has declined 27% in the last five years. The stock bounced higher in this year\u2019s first quarter after the company reinstated its quarterly dividend payment but has been treading water since April. Goldman Sachs sees the situation at Disney improving as the company invests heavily in enhancing its theme parks and making them more attractive to tourists.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of hand-wringing about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock after it decreased 13% in three trading days and entered correction territory. (A stock is considered to be in a correction if it declines 10% from recent highs.) Some in the financial press are screaming that a bubble is bursting in stocks associated with artificial intelligence and warning that the semiconductor industry is going down like the Titanic.\n\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to pump the breaks. They stress that the decline is due to profit-taking and option contract expirations as we approach the end of the second quarter on June 30. Several analysts have issued notes to clients saying that Nvidia stock will likely continue rising following the current volatility. At Jeffries (NYSE:JEF), analysts raised their target price on Nvidia stock to $150 from $135 and reiterated a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has added Nvidia stock to its \u201cbest ideas.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock remained at 158% this year.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center.

Its shares have been rallying since the company unveiled its AI strategy earlier in June. Melius Research has raised its price target on AAPL stock to $260 a share from $227, saying the company is entering a new iPhone era. At the same time, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reiterated its \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which the company calls \u201cApple Intelligence.\u201d They think it will lead consumers to upgrade their iPhones to get the AI enhancements and benefits. These include a revamped Siri digital assistant and the addition of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology on future iPhones. AAPL stock has rallied 10% since its AI strategy became public. Year to date, the share price is up 13%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) closed at $457.38 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.02% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.09%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.1%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.16%.\n\nThe the stock of investment bank has risen by 0.2% in the past month, lagging the Finance sector's gain of 0.26% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.83%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Goldman Sachs in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on July 15, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $8.87, indicating a 187.99% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.75 billion, up 17% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $36.63 per share and revenue of $51.68 billion, which would represent changes of +60.17% and +11.73%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "Now at the year\u2019s midpoint, some investors may be inclined to address the month-end\u2019s volatility in the tech scene. They may see it as an opportunity to take some profits off the table of their biggest first-half winner. Specifically, recent unpredictability hitting the semiconductor names may be a cause of concern for some. For others, it\u2019s an alarm bell signaling a pivot to more value-conscious dividends stocks that trade at relatively attractive multiples.\n\nThough only time will tell what to make of late-June tech volatility, I do think dividend stocks are looking quite attractive for investors who worry that the stock market\u2019s valuation may be getting slightly on the expensive side. Remember, a sector-based correction doesn\u2019t need to accompany the end of the bull market. Instead, it seems like more of a pitstop for investors to rebalance to a level that is most comfortable.\n\nLet\u2019s examine three dividend stocks to watch should value shine for summer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nCustomers haven\u2019t been loving McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) prices lately. And though inflation is to blame, it\u2019s clear that the perception of value that made McDonald\u2019s such a standout success is beginning to erode through the eyes of some.\n\nThe good news is McDonald\u2019s has been quick to react accordingly. It has not only won back the business of its most loyal customers. Additionally, it improved its odds of coming out victorious in what\u2019s shaping up to be a summertime \u201cvalue menu war.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the $5 meal deal offers outstanding value. But McDonald\u2019s also looks to be sweetening the pot with a Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) partnership. Therefore, recent lackluster sales could be followed by a summer sales boom as customers take advantage of the deals and new items on tap.\n\nNow down 13% from its high, with a 2.6% dividend yield, MCD stock is a dividend stock that is incredibly intriguing, even timely.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) The logo for T-Mobile is displayed on a sign for an indoor retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t been following the high-performing telecom, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) now pays a dividend. And yes, it\u2019s small in stature (1.47% yield) compared to other dividend stocks. Yet it looks to have the most room to grow as T-Mobile continues outdoing its wireless peers.\n\nAt writing, TMUS stock is flirting with new all-time highs close to $180 per share. Despite the more than 30% pop over the past year, I still view the telecom titan as having more room to sail steadily higher in the second half.\n\nConsiderable wireless momentum and a huge chunk of United States Cellular (NYSE:USM) assets will fall into T-Mobile\u2019s hands in a deal worth $4.4 billion. TMUS stock still has numerous growth drivers to continue its run. Further, the stock still looks modestly priced at 24.2 times trailing P/E, given the resilience of its earnings drivers.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is an investment banking heavyweight that\u2019s been faring incredibly well lately, thanks in part to the recent rise in capital markets activity. With GS stock recently coming off new highs close to $460 per share, the 2.44%-yielder doesn\u2019t look as cheap as it did this time last year. The stock goes for 18.0 times trailing P/E, which seems to be on the high end for the name.\n\nRegardless, GS stock is a dividend play to hold, as the capital markets recovery may still have legs as firms look to get more skin in the AI boom.\n\nWhether we\u2019re talking about firms getting more active on the M&A front to bolster their AI capabilities or AI up-and-comers looking to go public with an IPO, the capital markets are on good footing again. And activity could certainly stay upbeat going into the second half as more firms grab the AI bull by the horns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of McDonald\u2019s.

Investors include endowments, foundations, family offices, bank wealth platforms and sovereign wealth funds.\n\nThe premiere caps a busy year for Jain \u2014 former co-chief investment officer at Millennium Management \u2014 who has traveled the world pitching his fund. He initially aimed to gather as much as $10 billion. But after struggling to hit that goal, he cut client fees to entice investors and reduced his target to between $5 billion and $6 billion.\n\nA representative for the firm declined to comment.\n\nEven with the revised goal, Jain Global is the biggest launch since 2018. Jain topped fellow Millennium alumnus Diego Megia, whose Taula Capital Management began trading this month with $5 billion. Megia spun out his macro pod from Millennium and received $3 billion from his former employer.\n\nJain has been raising money in a challenging environment, as interest rates remain elevated and deals have slowed to a trickle. New hedge funds also face stiff competition from bigger multistrategy funds with established track records.\n\nDespite those obstacles, Jain Global is starting off big \u2014 having hired 215 people, including 42 portfolio managers. The firm has seven businesses that will go live on July 1, including an Asia-Pacific business that will essentially act as a multimanager platform and trade six strategies, with the profits feeding into the Jain fund.\n\nThe firm raised money via a so-called drawdown fund, meaning it will tap the cash as needed over a year.\n\nMichael Gelband\u2019s ExodusPoint still enjoys the distinction of biggest-ever hedge fund debut. Yet another Millennium alumnus, Gelband raised $8 billion for a multistrategy fund that began in 2018 and has fixed-income and equity businesses.\n\nJain launched his own shop after leaving Millennium, where he shared the CIO title with founder Izzy Englander. Over his seven years there, he helped the multistrategy giant push into new strategies, recruit, upgrade technologies and develop its central risk book. Millennium\u2019s assets doubled to about $60 billion during his tenure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrior to Millennium, Jain spent more than two decades at Credit Suisse Group AG, where he held many senior titles including head of global proprietary trading and global head of asset management.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Corporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Identifying both promising and cheap stocks to buy is a perpetual challenge for investors. This is especially true in an uncertain market where companies are trading at nearly all-time highs.\n\nThe appeal of cheap stocks lies in their potential for high returns, but finding the right ones requires careful analysis. Investors need to know that \u2018\u2019cheap\u2019\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to a small market cap or low share price. Financial metrics such as forward price to earnings (P/E), price to sales (P/S), earnings per share growth, and free cash flow are all important metrics to value a company.\n\nHowever, those are certainly not the be-all and end-all, making this journey that much more difficult. By examining companies\u2019 financial health, market positioning, and future growth prospects, investors can make more informed decisions to outperform the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the three best cheap stocks to buy to make early investors exceedingly wealthy in 2024 and beyond!\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), a global investment banking powerhouse, might not typically be considered a \u2018\u2019cheap\u2019\u2019 stock due to its high share price. However, when evaluating its financial metrics, it becomes apparent that the company may currently be undervalued.\n\nGoldman Sachs has navigated a particularly challenging interest rate environment over the last 24 months. This inevitably placed a dent in its revenue and earnings growth, with its stock price suffering from the windfall. However, its business is gradually turning around as the global economy recovers, making it well-positioned to benefit from increased deal flow and market activity.\n\nThe stock is currently up 18% YTD, driven by strong first-quarter results and growing optimism on interest rate cuts. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 16% year over year to $14.21 billion. Earnings per share swelled 32% year over year to $11.58 per share, with strong growth across its investment banking and wealth management divisions. Moreover, with a forward price to earnings of 13 the stock looks attractive at current levels. This makes GS stock one of the top cheap stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a leading provider of silicon carbide modules and semiconductors for the electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage markets. Despite facing a slowdown in its business, it remains one of the best cheap stocks to buy to get filthy rich.\n\nON Semiconductor lost its appeal as the renewable energy sector was crushed by inflation and higher interest rates in 2023. However, in 2021 and 2022 it thrived on the back of strong demand for power management and sensor solutions. This led the company to deliver record revenue and earnings, which have slowed down significantly in the last year. While this may seem like a drag, ON Semiconductor\u2019s business weathered the storm and delivered notable bottom-line growth in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company remains bullish on its mixed signals platform, as well as making strategic investments in expanding its manufacturing capacity. This includes its recent multi-year $2 billion investment in the Czech Republic for end-to-end silicon carbide production to power the future of electrification. Furthermore, secular tailwinds in the EV and energy storage markets provide fertile ground for long-term growth.\n\nCACI International (CACI) CACI International (CACI) website on a computer screen\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nCACI International (NYSE:CACI) is a lesser-known gem in the defense and intelligence sector. It primarily provides cybersecurity and enterprise IT solutions to U.S. government agencies, and its outlook for FY24 remains strong.\n\nCaci International\u2019s expertise in cybersecurity, signal intelligence, and digital solutions positions it uniquely in the defense industry. The company\u2019s ability to secure high-value government contracts remains steadfast. This helps ensure a steady revenue stream and healthy backlog to continue driving revenue growth and profitability. With growing geopolitical uncertainties across the globe, CACI remains well-positioned to capitalize on this wave.\n\nIn its latest quarterly financial results, revenue increased 11% year over year to $1.94 billion. Earnings per share rose 18% year over year to $5.13 per share, with adjusted EBITDA margin up 200 basis points. Moreover, its price-to-earnings ratio of 24 is attractive when considering its earnings outlook and long-term growth prospects. For investors looking for cheap stocks to buy, CACI International presents an extremely compelling case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Up from $336 last April, the bank's stock reached an all time high of $470 in May, and is now priced around $452. Mike Mayo, the head of Wells Fargo Securities U.S. large-cap bank research, says the stock could cross the $500 mark in the coming year.\n\nIt's a far cry from a year ago when The Economistcalled Goldman a \u201cWall Street laggard\u201d that had \u201clost its swagger.\u201d Mayo credits Goldman\u2019s rapid turnaround to the decision to cut its losses at Marcus and other consumer financial products and return to its core competencies banking big business.\n\n\u201cGoldman is back,\u201d Mayo told Fortune. \u201cThe mass market consumer has never been Goldman's forte, and they went ahead, and in my view, wasted several billion dollars, diverted management attention, and it was just to me, a foray that never should have been attempted.\u201d Mayo has marked Goldman\u2019s stock a \u201cbuy\u201d with a target price of $504. An analyst from Oppenheimer & Co. places the target at $517, while Morningstar marks it as a \u201chold\u201d at $417.\n\nLast August, Goldman announced plans to shutter its consumer and wealth management segment, including Marcus Invest, and move Marcus Deposits, which offers users high-yield savings accounts, to the asset and wealth management business. With the retail banking business \u201con the back burner,\u201d as Mayo says, roughly two thirds of the company is global banking markets, and a third is wealth and asset management.\n\nGoldman also pivoted way from one of its \"hobbies,\" in Mayo's words, selling its home improvement consumer loan originator GreenSky to\u00a0Sixth Street for an undisclosed amount, estimated to be between $62 million and $500 million. Just two years earlier Goldman had bought the company as part of its push into retail for $2.24 billion in an all-stock transaction.\n\nGoldman in the post-retail era\n\nTo maintain the upward trajectory Mayo wants to see Goldman continue to exit these projects, including the final bits of Marcus Invest, which should happen in less than a week. According to the Marcus by Goldman Sachs website any accounts still open as of June 29 will be transferred to their new owner, Betterment.\n\nWith retail now deprioritized, Mayo says Goldman will likely turn its attention to growing the wealth and asset management part of its services from single digit returns on investment last year to \"perhaps low double digits in 2024 and to mid-teens longer term.\" Last month Goldman raised more than $20 billion from private investors for direct lending.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cRaising third party funds for private capital leverages Goldman's unique relationship with institutions and investors,\u201d says Mayo. In Goldman\u2019s latest investor report for the quarter ending March 31, the bank reported net revenues of $14.21 billion and net earnings of $4.13 billion. The annualized return on average common shareholders\u2019 equity was 14.8%.\n\nThose funds could soon get a boost now that the Fed is reportedly considering reducing the capital requirements of big banks. If the capital requirement, which is designed to mitigate risk should a bank collapse, were reduced, it would free up capital to invest elsewhere.\n\nGoldman's rebound may have caught some by surprise, but beneath the surface the bank's stock performance has been on a long, slow upward trajectory. It has grown by 131% over the past five years and more than 500% since it went public 25 years ago in May.\n\nComing at a time when Wall Street is turning its back on making investment decisions that consider diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, Goldman last week reportedly doubled the number of participants it will admit to its free Black in Business education program, part of a plan to invest $10 billion in a million black women entrepreneurs.\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs\u2019 stock increased 16% this year so far, its Big Four competitors, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Citigroup have increased by 18%, 17%, 14% and 12% respectively. The S&P 500 increased by 15% year-to-date, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF that tracks a broader cross section of financial institutions including custody banks, regional banks and diversified financial services has been relatively neutral, decreasing slightly from $45.64 on January 2 to $44.86 today, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Regulators found weaknesses in \"living wills\" submitted by four of the country\u2019s largest banks detailing how the lenders would wind themselves down if something catastrophic were to happen.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determined that there was a \"shortcoming\" in the plans submitted in 2023 by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C).\n\nA shortcoming, according to the agencies, is a weakness that raises questions about the feasibility of the plan.\n\nWhere the two regulators disagreed was about the severity of weakness in the plan submitted by Citigroup.\n\nThe FDIC said it found the bank\u2019s plan weak enough to be considered a more serious \"deficiency,\" while the Fed stuck with the less-severe \"shortcoming\" rating. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe banks must tell regulators by September how they plan to fix their weaknesses, and they must also address the shortcomings in their next resolution plans due by July 1, 2025.\n\nRegulators didn\u2019t identify material weakness in the plans submitted by other large banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), State Street (STT) and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nLiving wills emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when a housing meltdown and the unraveling of Lehman Brothers triggered chaos across the financial system, taxpayer bailouts for giant financial institutions and a cascading series of bank failures.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank legislation passed in 2010 made it a requirement for banks of a certain size to put together these plans on a regular basis, showing how they could be wound down in the event of a crisis without putting the greater financial system at risk.\n\nThe shortcomings in the 2023 plans from JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman and Citigroup happened when they were asked to simulate an unwind of their derivatives and trading positions in two scenarios with different time frames.\n\nIn the case of Citigroup, regulators said the weakness had to do with a shortcoming identified in its 2021 plan \"regarding resolution data integrity and data management issues.\"\n\n\"The agencies have significant concerns with the amount of time that will be necessary to remediate the significant resolution data integrity weaknesses.\"\n\nIn a closed meeting Thursday on the topic, the FDIC's vice chairman Travis Hill voted against the board majority giving Citi a deficiency rating, finding the weakness in Citi's plan not as severe. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation headquarters, in Washington, DC. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The institution is in the midst of a multiyear process to address these underlying issues, which the firm\u2019s management has prioritized,\" Hill said in a statement Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitigroup said in a statement that \"we are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators. While we\u2019ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we\u2019ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas, including improving data quality and regulatory processes such as resolution planning.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure comes three days after Citigroup held an investor day to showcase its best-performing business and tout its transformation into a more efficient company.\n\nCEO Jane Fraser told investors during that event that the bank will do whatever it takes to get their regulatory processes up to snuff.\n\n\"We recognize there are places where progress has been too slow, so we have intensified our efforts in areas such as regulatory processes and the related data remediation,\" Fraser said Tuesday.\n\nThe company added in a statement Friday that \"we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Four of the biggest banks on Wall Street must improve their blueprints for a hypothetical wind-down after top US regulators found weaknesses in their plans.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAt Blackstone\u2019s $339 Billion Property Arm, the Honeymoon Is Over CDK Tells Car Dealers Their Systems Will Likely Be Down for Days Car Dealers Reel From Cyberattack on $1.2 Trillion Market United Airlines Jet Turns Back After Engine Piece Falls Off Car Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack\n\nThe so-called living wills of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. all had a \u201cshortcoming,\u201d the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Friday. The regulators reviewed the most recent resolution plans, which were mandated following the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cFor the four banks with an identified shortcoming, the letters describe the specific weaknesses resulting in the shortcoming and the remedial actions required by the agencies,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement. The regulators didn\u2019t identify weaknesses in the plans from Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., State Street Corp. or Morgan Stanley.\n\nBank of America, Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nCiti said it was \u201cfully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators.\u201d The lender \u201cwill invest what is necessary to support this critical effort,\u201d and is confident it could be resolved without taxpayer funds or negatively effecting the financial system, Citi said in a statement.\n\nThe Fed and FDIC diverged on the significance of the problems with Citi\u2019s plan. The FDIC deemed the weakness to constitute a \u201cdeficiency,\u201d a more severe finding. Because the two disagreed, Citi\u2019s weakness was deemed a \u201cshortcoming.\u201d\n\nThe finding of a shortcoming doesn\u2019t result in a penalty for banks. The regulators found issues with how each of the four banks\u2019 plans dealt with derivatives.\n\nAccording to the regulators, Citi\u2019s plan could not add in \u201cupdated stress scenarios and assumptions.\u201d They also said issues with data reliability contributed to inaccurate calculations regarding how much capital would required for executing the plan. Meanwhile, JPMorgan\u2019s strategy couldn\u2019t update some economic conditions in calculating the necessary capital and liquidity to carry out its plan, regulators said.\n\nBank of America\u2019s living will plan wouldn\u2019t work for some derivatives transactions, the agencies said, calling into question the firm\u2019s ability to execute it. Goldman\u2019s wind-down plan was found not to fully capture the complexity of its derivatives portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe regulators made their determinations based on plans submitted in 2023. The banks with weaknesses are required to deal with them in new resolution plans due July 1, 2025, according to the regulators.\n\n--With assistance from Katherine Doherty, Todd Gillespie and Sridhar Natarajan.\n\n(Updates with weaknesses identified by agencies starting in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Analyst Downgrades? 3 Stocks to Bet Against the Bears and Bag Big Gains",
        "content": "On Wall Street, analyst downgrades often trigger alarm bells, leading to short-term declines in the share price of such downgraded stocks. Yet many investors regard those analyst downgrades as potential long-term stocks to buy. In fact, a 2012 study involving 11,000 global analysts revealed surprisingly low accuracy rates for target prices. Analysts were correct only 30% of the time with 12-month targets and a mere 18% with short-term forecasts.\n\nIn other words, downgrades frequently lead to a shift in the short-term market sentiment. Smart investors recognize that stocks that have fallen out of favor may hold untapped value. Therefore, let\u2019s explore recent analyst downgrades that bring to the forefront three stocks to buy in the second half of the year.\n\nDelek U.S. Holdings (DK) 3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocks\n\nSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to stocks to buy after analyst downgrades, downstream energy company Delek U.S. Holdings (NYSE:DK) stands out. Founded in 2001, this Tennessee-based company operates in the petroleum refining, logistics and retail segments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Delek U.S. Holdings reported an adjusted net loss of $26 million, or 41 cents per share. This performance marked an improvement from the previous quarter. That was driven primarily by the Refining segment, which saw a $117 million boost due to higher cracks and capture rates. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $753 million, reflecting a $69 million increase during the period.\n\nHowever, on June 10, TD Cowendowngraded DK stock from hold to sell, slashing the price target from $25 to $20 due to potential underperformance concerns. Also, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) lowered their target prices in June, maintaining cautious outlooks.\n\nDK stock has declined around 8% this year but offers a 4.2% dividend yield. The shares are trading at a discounted valuation level of 0.1 times sales and 33.3 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, analysts have set a 12-month median price target of $26 for DK stock, implying a more than 8% upside potential.\n\nRoper Technologies (ROP) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) is a Florida-based tech firm renowned for its software and engineered products across multiple sectors. Roper\u2019s portfolio includes management, diagnostic, and laboratory information management software, cloud-based financial analytics, and performance management software, among others.\n\nROP delivered robust Q1 results with a 14% increase in total revenue and an organic revenue growth of 8%. Also, management increased its full-year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and adjusted EPS, reflecting the company\u2019s confidence in its growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite robust earnings, Roper Technologies wasn\u2019t immune to analyst downgrades. On June 13, Wolfe Research changed its rating from peer perform to underperform, citing valuation concerns. Yet, others on Wall Street highlight that strategic acquisitions, like Procare and a disciplined capital deployment strategy have positioned the company for future expansion.\n\nROP stock has gained nearly 3% year-to-date (YTD). Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30.1x and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.4x. Analysts project a 12-month median price target of $618.50 for ROP stock, a potential 10% upside from current levels.\n\nW. R. Berkley (WRB) a person holds up a scrap of paper that asks \"Are you covered?\"\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInsurer W.R. Berkley (NYSE:WRB) has a market capitalization of over $20 billion, establishing itself as a significant entity in the insurance sector.\n\nW.R. Berkley\u2019s Q1 of 2024 results impressed analysts, with a 50.4% year-over-year (YOY) surge in net income to $442 million. Adjusted diluted EPS rose to a remarkable $1.56 from $1 in the year-ago quarter. However, the company faced a setback with its investment fund performance, swinging from a $2.18 million income to a $29.35 million loss YOY. This led analysts from RBC Capital of Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY), Wells Fargo and Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) to cut their target prices.\n\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded WRP stock from buy to neutral, citing concerns over potential market volatility and regulatory changes. This highlights uncertainties related to claim cost trends and litigation risks in the insurance sector. However, W.R. Berkley remains focused on profitability and shareholder value. A recent 3-for-2 stock split further demonstrates their commitment.\n\nDespite downgrades, WRB shares have delivered a 13% return since January. With a forward P/E ratio of 13.7x and P/S of 1.7x, the stock appears attractively valued. Finally, Wall Street projects a 12-month median price target of $87.10, implying an 8.6% potential upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It advises buying puts on the US ticker and selling those on the Taiwan shares.\n\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy in the US has pushed TSMC\u2019s ADRs to their highest average price since 2009 relative to the Taiwan shares this quarter.

        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 50 Largest Companies in Every State in the US, and in this article we will look at the largest company.\n\nEconomy of\u00a0 US\n\nThe United States holds the title of the largest economy in the world, according to the IMF in 2024 the United States had a GDP of approximately $28.78 trillion, a GDP per capita of around $85,370, and an annual GDP growth rate of 2.7%. In 2025, GDP is expected to rise to $29.84 trillion whereas GDP per capita is expected to rise around $87,980. The United States possesses a large and skilled labor force, a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit along with highly diversified companies in technology, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and entertainment which generate productivity and economic growth. Additionally, the U.S. dollar serves as the world's primary reserve currency and is used to facilitate international trade and investment.\n\nCertain regions in the United States stand out as hubs of economic power and innovation. Silicon Valley in the San Franciso Bay Area, California has long been the hub of technological innovation in software, hardware, and biotechnology. Some of the largest tech giants such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) among many others are headquartered in Silicon Valley. Wall Street, the financial district in Lower Manhattan in New York City on the other side is home to major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Wall Street serves as the center of the world's financial markets and facilitates the flow of capital, investments, and trading activities on a massive scale. In recent years, there has been a notable trend of companies relocating from high-tax states to low-tax states in pursuit of cost savings and favorable business environments. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are some of the largest companies that moved their incorporations from California to Texas. According to CNBC, more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Delaware. Delaware is one of the top choices for corporations due to their business-friendly policies, lower taxes, reduced regulation, and incentives for relocation. Delaware has a strategic location and its corporate law is highly developed, the state's Court of Chancery, a specialized court for business disputes, is known for its efficient resolution of legal cases. It allows businesses to maintain confidentiality and offers incentives for relocation such as tax credits, grants, and loans. Delaware does not have a state sales tax, and its corporate income tax of 8.7% is considered one of the lowest in the United States. You can also take a look at 15 States with No or Lowest Sales Tax Rates in the US.\n\nStory continues\n\nLargest Company in the US\n\nFounded in 1975, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a globally recognized company known for its software products, such as the Windows operating system and Office productivity tools.

Over 65% of Fortune 500 companies and 53,000 customers now use the Azure OpenAI Service. The introduction of the Models as a Service API and partnerships with Nvidia and AMD for AI hardware accelerators are significantly boosting the growth of Microsoft's cloud business. Additionally, Microsoft's Copilot offerings, integrated into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, are transforming productivity and democratizing AI-powered capabilities, further increasing Microsoft's share in office productivity tools.\n\nAzure AI Services has also impacted the legal industry by efficiently managing and analyzing vast amounts of data in the fast-paced legal environment and the legal field is highly exposed to the effects of new AI technologies. With traditional data sources like emails and documents now supplemented by complex data types such as chat data and video recordings, legal teams face significant challenges. AI is increasingly used to streamline processes, reduce risks, and boost efficiency. Companies like Icertis, Relativity, and Clifford Chance are at the forefront of integrating AI into their operations by leveraging Azure AI Services to enhance contract management, e-discovery, and overall legal service delivery.

The company\u2019s Azure and cloud services revenue increased 31% year over year and Microsoft Cloud revenue amounted to $35.1 billion.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley, leads the world in technology and innovation and New York\u2019s Wall Street serves as the global hub for banking, investments, and trading, each state in the United States possesses its own unique strengths and specialties. With this context, let\u2019s take a look at the list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US.

The estimated valuation was sourced from major media reports based on the private companies' latest funding round. The annual revenue or number of employees was sourced from official statements by the company and the company's website. We have ranked the 50 largest companies in every state in the US in ascending order of largest companies incorporated in that state according to their market capitalization, as of June 11, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS is well-positioned for growth on the back of its focus on core operations, opportunistic buyouts and improving demand in global deal-making. Moreover, a deepening market presence and solid liquidity will further aid financials.\r\n \r\nOver the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved north by 3.3% and 2.6%, respectively. GS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nOver the past three months, shares of Goldman have gained 17.7%, outperforming the industry\u2019s rise of 8.7%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into the reasons that make GS stock worth betting on now.\r\n\r\nEarnings Growth: Goldman witnessed earnings growth of 3.7% over the past three to five years. This was driven by strategic business streamlining efforts to boost investment banking and trading operations and efforts to improve the business mix toward recurring and durable revenues.\r\n \r\nAlso, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and lagged in one, with the average beat being 22.78%.\r\n\r\nOur projections for earnings indicate 57.4%, 8.6% and 1.1% growth on a year-over-year basis in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\r\n\r\nStrategic Buyouts & Divestitures: Goldman remains engaged in strategic initiatives to boost its IB and trading businesses. In the past year, the company has completed the sale of GreenSky, divested its Personal Financial Management unit and sold a substantial portion of Marcus\u2019s loan portfolio.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, GS acquired NN Investment and robo-advisor NextCapital. These boosted its global presence and wealth and asset management capabilities and helped further diversify fee-revenue streams and enhance top-line stability.\r\n\r\nRevenue Strength: Driven by strategic initiatives and growth in non-interest revenues, Goldman\u2019s net revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1% over the last four years (2019-2023). The trend continued in the first quarter of 2024 as well. Organic growth measures and an improving revenue mix are likely to support top-line expansion.\n\nFurther, a deepening market presence and improving global deal-making pipeline are likely to keep revenue growth healthy going forward.\r\n\r\nOur estimates for net revenues indicate 11.6%, 4% and 2.2% growth in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\r\n \r\nStrong Balance Sheet: As of Mar 31, 2024, Goldman\u2019s total cash and cash equivalents were $209 billion. Total unsecured debt (comprising long-term and short-term borrowings) was $312 billion. Out of this, only $78 billion was in near-term borrowings. Hence, a solid liquidity position allows the company to address its near-term obligations.\r\n\r\nStock Seems Undervalued: GS\u2019s price-to-book and price-to-earnings (F1) ratios of 1.35 and 12.31 are well below the industry average of 2.19 and 17.94, respectively.

        "title": "CME Group: Threat of New Competition Is Fully Priced In",
        "content": "CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) has a long history of delivering solid results for investors. Over the past 10 years, the financial services company has delivered investors a total return of roughly 325%. Comparably, the S&P 500 has posted a total return of roughly 230% over the same period.\n\nThe stock's move higher has been a result of strong earnings growth for the company. CME has benefited from steady increases in trading volume for key products and the launch of additional products.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CME.\n\nWhile CME is fairly diversified in terms of its product offerings, the company's biggest business segment is interest rates, which account for roughly 28% of total revenue. Key product offerings in this segment include U.S. Treasury futures and secured overnight financing rate futures. CME Group: Threat of New Competition Is Fully Priced In\n\nThreat of new competition\n\nCME has long dominated the U.S. interest rate futures market as its market share of trading volume in this segment is estimated to be more than 99%. The company's dominance of this business has given it solid pricing power and helped it deliver industry best profit margins. Its net profit margin of roughly 57% compares favorably to peers such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) and CBOE Global Markets (CBOE), which have profit margins of roughly 24% and 21%.\n\nDespite its strong position in the interest rate futures market, Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and BGC Partners (NASDAQ:BGC), has recently decided to challenge CME in this market. BGC's FMX trading platform, which has an estimated 28% market share in cash Treasuries trading, is expected to introduce SOFR futures in September 2024 followed by U.S. Treasury futures in early 2025.\n\nThe FMX futures platform is backed by large financial institutions, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citadel Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and others. Lutnick has said the FMX plans to compete with CME by offering lower trading fees and more product innovation.\n\nNot the fist time CME has faced competition\n\nDuring CME's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Terry Duffy responded to an analyst question regarding new competition from FMX:\n\nI have sat here for 22 years as the chairman and CEO of this company since we went public, and I've seen nothing but competition my entire career, so this is no different. I take every single bit of competition seriously, as I'm sure others do about CME as we continue to move our business forward.\n\nIn 2009, Lutnick-backed ELX Futures tried to compete with CME on interest rate futures, but failed to gain much traction due to a lack of clearing arrangements. In 2011, it also faced a challenge from NYSE Euronext, now owned by Intercontinental Exchange, which also failed to gain traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nFMX poses a more serious threat, but CME still has the advantage\n\nThe key difference between BGC's FMX futures offering and previous challenges to CME's dominance in interest rate futures is the fact the company has arranged for trades to be cleared through LCH. Historically, no competitor was able to deliver interest rate futures through a well-established clearing house as CME did not allow competitors to clear through its clearing house. LCH is one of the largest clearing houses in the world and thus, has the potential to offer FMX futures users efficient margining, which is similar to what CME can offer.\n\nFMX poses a significant threat to CME due to the fact it is backed by a large consortium of sophisticated financial services companies and has arranged for clearing through LCH. However, I believe that as the incumbent, CME has a significant advantage. Market participants are likely to require a significant incentive to move over to a new exchange, which could increase operational complexity related to trading.\n\nCME could temporarily lower trading fees to eliminate any incentive for market participants to move over to FMX. While such an approach might result in a near-term hit to profits, CME would remain highly profitable due to its other businesses and would be able to raise fees again in the future once the FMX threat is gone.\n\nAs the incumbent, CME also benefits from already having a much more liquid marketplace than BGC's FMX platform is likely to have initially. Thus, large trade orders are likely to continue to be routed through CME due to superior liquidity, which may make it difficult for FMX to gain market share.\n\nValuation is below historical norms\n\nCME currently trades at roughly 20 times forward earnings. While this valuation level represents a slight discount to the broader market, it is a significant discount to the valuation it has traded at over the past several years.\n\nWhile the company has only moderate growth prospects, which tend to be heavily impacted by market moves and volatility, I believe the stock deserves to trade at a premium to the broader market. Historically, over the past 10 years, the company has grown earnings per share at a compound annual rate of roughly 11%. In addition to delivering strong earnings growth, CME benefits from limited cyclicality as trading activity, which drives fees, tends to increase during times of market stress. For this reason, I believe investors should be willing to pay a premium for CME shares as it is one of the few that benefits from challenging economic conditions.\n\nSince the SEC approved BGC's proposed interest rate futures offering on Jan. 22, CME shares have fallen by roughly 3%. The S&P 500 has risen by roughly 10% over the same period, while BGC Group shares have risen by roughly 16%.\n\nOver the past five years, CME has traded at an average price-earnings ratio of roughly 29.50. Thus, the stock's current valuation represents a discount to recent historical norms. Moreover, the stock has a GF Value of $228 per share, which suggests the stock is modestly undervalued based on historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings estimates. CME Group: Threat of New Competition Is Fully Priced In\n\nRegulatory risk\n\nWhile I am a bullish on CME and believe the company is well positioned to fend off the challenge from BGC's FMX, regulatory risk remains a potential concern. Given its massive scale and unique position within the financial system, the company faces extensive regulation. While CME enjoys a near monopoly position in the U.S. interest rate futures market, regulators could decide that this poses a threat to the financial system and create incentives to increase competition. For example, regulators could require CME to open its clearing house to other exchanges. Moreover, regulators could also challenge its right to exclusively list other key products such as S&P 500 Index futures, which represent a key revenue driver.\n\nConclusion\n\nCME benefits from a dominant position in the U.S. interest rate futures market, which has helped the company maintain very high profit margins historically. The highly profitable nature of this business has drawn competition previously, but no other exchange has successfully challenged it in this business.\n\nBGC's FMX futures represent a new challenger to CME and is a potential threat due to the sophistication of its backers and agreement with LCH on clearing. The threat has helped drive CME shares lower in recent months and the stock now trades at a discount to its own historical average.\n\nAs the incumbent, CME is well position to fend off competition from the FMX platform. Thus, I believe its shares are undervalued and investors currently have the chance to purchase a very high-quality company at an attractive valuation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Goldman (GS): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Goldman Sachs (GS) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nGoldman currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.48, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.48 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 73.9% and 4.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GS Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GS\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Goldman here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Goldman, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs GS a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Goldman, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $36.63.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Goldman.

        "content": "Investing.com -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is moving to scrap an European Union cap on bonuses for its London-based staff only weeks after a similar decision by rival Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), according to Sky News.\n\nCiting unnamed sources, Sky News said on Wednesday JPMorgan was in the process of notifying its workers some parts it would maintain some parts of the compensation package unveiled after the EU's cap on variable pay came into effect in 2014.\n\nUnder the EU rules, employees deemed \"material risk-takers\" working in a bank's operations within the bloc were barred from earning more than twice their fixed salary. However, JPMorgan has chosen to increase that threshold to a multiple of 10, Sky News reported.\n\nWall Street's largest lender has also decided to keep a significant amount of workers' fixed pay allowances that are used to determine bonuses, Sky News said. A source told the Sky News that this was desirable for employees eager to maintain incomes to pay for monthly expenses like mortgages.\n\nLast month, Sky News also reported that Goldman Sachs planned to lift its own bonus cap from twice a fixed salary to as high as a multiple of 25.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJPMorgan lifts EU bonus cap for London-based workers - Sky News\n\nAlong Peru's mining corridor, Big Copper faces a snarl of trucks\n\nEarnings call: Patterson Companies reports modest growth amid challenges\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Goldman Sachs (GS) closed at $457.43, marking a +1.61% move from the previous day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.25% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.15%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.03%.\n\nShares of the investment bank have depreciated by 2.76% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Finance sector's loss of 2.3% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.34%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Goldman Sachs in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on July 15, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $8.87, marking a 187.99% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $12.76 billion, indicating a 17.12% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $36.57 per share and revenue of $51.71 billion, indicating changes of +59.9% and +11.81%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Goldman Sachs. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. Goldman Sachs is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Goldman Sachs is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 12.31. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.94, which means Goldman Sachs is trading at a discount to the group.\n\nWe can also see that GS currently has a PEG ratio of 0.91. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. Financial - Investment Bank stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.12 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 27, finds itself in the top 11% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Goldman Sachs (GS) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now",
        "content": "Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nGoldman Sachs in Focus\n\nBased in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 15.73%. Currently paying a dividend of $2.75 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.46%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.81%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.59%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $11 is up 4.8% from last year. In the past five-year period, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 26.83%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 43%. This means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nEarnings growth looks solid for GS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $36.57 per share, with earnings expected to increase 59.90% from the year ago period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that GS is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Sold US$32m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "The fact that multiple The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, John F. Rogers, sold US$6.9m worth of shares at a price of US$468 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$446. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nInsiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nInsiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Goldman Sachs Group shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nDoes Goldman Sachs Group Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$723m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group and we suggest you have a look.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "title": "Chipotle Shareholders Approve Its Historic 50-for-1 Stock Split. Here's What Happens Next.",
        "content": "Chipotle(NYSE: CMG) is one step closer to the finish line of its historic stock split. At its annual meeting of shareholders held on June 6, 2024, shareholders approved the measure, paving the way for its 50-for-1 stock split to take place later this month.\n\nThere are a few important dates for shareholders to remember. Let's review the particulars so investors will be prepared for the upcoming stock split. Image source: Chipotle.\n\nMark your calendar\n\nChipotle's press release cited several key dates shareholders should mark on their calendars.\n\nThe first key date was the annual meeting that took place on June 6, when shareholders voted on the stock split, which the company noted was \"one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history.\" The company said that \"shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of its common stock,\" which marks an important milestone in the process.\n\nThe second key date noted by Chipotle management is the record date. Each shareholder of record as of the close of business on Tuesday, June 25 will be entitled to take part in the upcoming stock split, receiving 49 additional shares for every share they currently own.\n\nThe third key date is the distribution date. After the close of business on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, each shareholder will receive the newly minted shares. This officially takes place after the market closes, and the additional shares will automatically be deposited to shareholders' brokerage accounts.\n\nIf you're already a Chipotle stockholder, you don't need to do anything more to receive the additional shares. However, it's important to remember that the process can vary from brokerage to brokerage, so some investors might notice a lag of hours or even days before the additional shares show up in your account.\n\nFinally, Wednesday, June 26, is the date Chipotle will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis. Investors should expect shares to trade at roughly one-fiftieth of the price before the split occurred. For example, for each share they own recently worth $3,250, post-split investors will own 50 shares worth roughly $65 each.\n\nBut is the stock a buy?\n\nThere's little question that Chipotle has become synonymous with fresh ingredients, and the company is a leader in the fast-casual dining space. This has helped the stock climb an impressive 43% so far this year. Looking further back, early investors were treated to mind-boggling returns, with the stock up more than 14,742% (as of this writing) since its IPO in 2006. With the stock split on the horizon, and the stock trading near record highs, investors are faced with the quintessential investing question: Is the stock a buy, or has the opportunity passed?\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite Chipotle's impressive march higher, there's still much more opportunity ahead for the burrito purveyor, as evidenced by its recent financial report. In the first quarter, Chipotle generated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 14% year over year, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $13.01, up 24%. It's always telling when EPS outpaces revenue growth, as that's a sign that a business' scale and leverage is such that it drops more profits to the bottom line.\n\nFurthermore, Chipotle's comparable restaurant sales (or comps) increased 7%, driven by transactions that jumped 5%, while the average check increased 2%. The company also continues to squeeze more revenue out of each location, as average restaurant sales increased 2%.\n\nChipotle had 3,479 restaurants at the end of the first quarter, but management is ultimately targeting 7,000 locations in North America. While international growth has taken a back seat to its domestic push, there's also still plenty of opportunity abroad.\n\nDespite the stock hitting an all-time high this week, some on Wall Street believe there's much more to come. Analysts at Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) called Chipotle a \"top idea,\" assigning a buy rating and a price target of $3,730. This represents potential gains for investors of 18% over the coming year, compared to the stock's closing price on Wednesday. The analyst cited Chipotle's \"ability to scale the business in a highly profitable manner without losing grip on the core operations, including the quality of food/customer experience.\"\n\nTaken together, the company's robust results, its vast opportunity, and Wall Street's increasingly bullish take illustrate that Chipotle has a long runway of growth ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) stock is flirting with new 52-week highs. The rally is likely being powered by improving macro conditions and increased confidence in SPG\u2019s prospects following its recent dividend hike streak. The retail property giant has raised its dividend 10 times over the past four years, having sustained a tremendous post-pandemic recovery. Further, Simon Property Group is expected to post record profits this year, which could sustain its momentum. Consequently, I remain bullish on the stock.\n\nPost-Pandemic Dividend Growth Streak Impresses\n\nIn my view, the most notable catalyst fueling SPG\u2019s current rally is its excellent post-pandemic dividend growth trajectory. The company had to slash its dividend in Q2 2020 due to widespread panic in the retail REIT industry at the onset of the pandemic. The quarterly dividend rate was reduced from $2.10 to $1.30 at the time, and the company did indeed face significant challenges for a couple of years.\n\nHowever, Simon Property Group\u2019s portfolio has proven to be one of the most resilient in the sector, allowing the company to achieve a swift recovery in its financials, even in the face of rising interest rates. Despite elevated rates currently pressuring the company\u2019s bottom line, as is the case with all of its sector peers, SPG is poised to post record profits this year.\n\nThis strong performance has enabled Simon to rapidly reinstate its dividend to pre-pandemic levels. The most recent dividend hike announced alongside its Q1 results was a 2.6% increase to $2.00, bringing the dividend very close to its pre-pandemic level. Interestingly, the current annualized rate of $8.00 implies a solid dividend yield of 5.4%, even with shares rallying recently. Combined with the potential for additional dividend growth, SPG remains a highly compelling dividend pick.\n\nRecord Profits Support More Dividend Increases\n\nTo assess SPG\u2019s potential for further dividend increases, let\u2019s examine its performance, which, so far, points toward record profits for this year. In Q1, the company recorded total revenues of $1.44 billion, 6.7% higher compared to last year. This was driven by improved occupancy rates and a higher base minimum rent (BMR). Specifically, at the end of March, Simon Property Group\u2019s occupancy was 95.5%, up 110 basis points compared to last year, while its BMR was $57.53, up 3% compared to Q1 2023.\n\nIn the meantime, while interest expenses did rise to $230.6 million from $199.4 million last year, the 15.6% increase wasn\u2019t all that bad and proved easily absorbable. The company boosted its bottom line through gains primarily from selling its remaining ownership interest in Authentic Brands Group. Thus, its funds from operations per share (FFO/share, a cash-flow metric used by REITs) still grew by 30% to $3.56.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on the company\u2019s first-quarter results and current lease profile, management raised their FY2024 outlook. FFO/share for the full year is now expected to land between $12.75 and $12.90. This implies a year-over-year increase of 2.6% compared to last year and a new FFO/share all-time high. To my point, it also implies significant room for the dividend to grow from its current annualized rate of $8.00.\n\nThe Valuation Remains Reasonable\n\nSPG\u2019s recent share price gains have resulted in a valuation expansion. At the midpoint of management\u2019s outlook, SPG stock is trading at a price/FFO of 11.6x. This is somewhat higher than the more depressed single-digit multiples seen in 2022 and 2023 during its earlier post-pandemic recovery phase.\n\nThat said, I believe the current valuation remains fair. At their current levels, shares offer a considerable yield, while the dividend has room to grow. Further, with inflation easing faster than expected in May, interest rates are likely to be cut sooner rather than later. This should assist all REIT valuations, including SPG\u2019s, which is likely to see further multiple expansion.\n\nIs SPG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street\u2019s sentiment on Simon Property remains relatively bullish. The retail real estate company now features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. At $165.45, the\u00a0average SPG stock price target implies 11% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure which analyst to follow to navigate your decisions in buying and selling SPG stock, check Caitlin Burrows, who represents Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Her track record over a one-year time frame has been excellent, boasting an average return of 33.05% per rating and a success rate of 100%. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nOverall, I believe that Simon Property\u2019s impressive post-pandemic recovery, robust dividend growth, and record profit projections position the stock as a compelling investment. Further, despite recent share price gains, the stock\u2019s current valuation remains reasonable, presenting an attractive opportunity for dividend-oriented investors. If anything, the possibility of interest rate cuts in the near term further strengthens its investment case, which is likely to sustain the stock\u2019s rally.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google CEO Sundar Pinchai testified briefly Friday at the federal financial conspiracy trial surrounding buzz-to-bust startup Ozy Media, countering founder Carlos Watson's alleged claims that the search giant once sought to buy Ozy.\n\nGoogle did consider hiring Watson for a high-level news executive job in 2021 and putting $25 million into Ozy in something of a tradeoff for luring him away, Pinchai told jurors.\n\n\u201cMr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,\" he explained.\n\nBut \u201cdid you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?\u201d prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Pinchai, who heads Google and parent Alphabet Inc.\n\nHe said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Watson later told another prospective investor that Pinchai himself had extended a nine-figure offer to buy Ozy. The Mountain View, California-based company produced TV programs, podcasts and a music-and-ideas festival before falling apart in fall 2021 amid questions about whether it had flagrantly misrepresented its audience reach, deals and finances.\n\nWatson and Ozy Media have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit fraud. He has said that he built a robust and real company, didn't con anyone and is being singled out for prosecution when he made, at most, entrepreneurial \u201cmistakes.\u201d\n\nDefense lawyers have blamed any misrepresentations on Ozy co-founder Samir Rao, saying he is falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Rao pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiring to commit fraud, and he is awaiting sentencing.\n\nHe testified earlier in the trial that his \u201cmoral compass\u201d got scrambled by ambition, desperation to keep the company going and \u201cCarlos\u2019 deep belief that failure was not an option and we had to do whatever it took.\u201d\n\nAmong other deceit, Rao infamously posed as a YouTube executive \u2014 even using a phone app to disguise his voice \u2014 in order to champion Ozy to Goldman Sachs investment bankers on a February 2021 call.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the most disturbing calls that I have ever been on in my career,\u201d Goldman executive Hillel Moerman testified Friday, calling the episode \u201ca surreal experience.\u201d\n\nRao testified that he did the phone trick to back up a false claim that YouTube was paying for Watson\u2019s eponymous talk show. Rao said Watson was with him during the call, texting him about what to say: \u201cI am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,\u201d read one text that was shown to jurors.\n\nStory continues\n\nDefense lawyer Ronald Sullivan Jr. has said Watson came into the room during the call, realized \u201ca live train wreck\u201d was unfolding and tried to get Rao to end the conversation.\n\nOn the other end, Moerman thought the putative YouTube exec's voice seemed obviously \u201coff,\u201d among other clues that made the Goldman bankers suspicious, he recalled Friday.\n\nOne of his colleagues soon called the actual executive at YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet. The ruse unraveled. So did the potential for a Goldman investment.\n\n\u201cWe had been lied to,\u201d Moerman explained to the Brooklyn federal court jury.\n\nGoldman Sachs did keep advertising with Ozy after the episode, according to Rao's testimony.\n\nWatson told Goldman and Ozy\u2019s board that Rao had suffered a mental health crisis. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants at the time but wasn't having a psychiatric break.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Best Energy Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "As we head into the summer driving season, crude oil prices have retreated from their April highs. As a result, the energy sector has been one of the worst-performing sectors over the past month. However, considering the sector\u2019s bargain valuation, looking for the best energy stocks to buy will reward patient investors.\n\nEnergy stocks are one of the most undervalued sectors on an absolute basis. According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), energy stocks trade at a next 12-month (NTM) price-to-earnings of 11.8 and a 6.7% free cash flow yield. That\u2019s a significant discount to the S&P 500\u2019s 20.9 times NTM P/E. Maybe more to the point, the market has yet to appreciate the cost discipline and shareholder return focus that most energy stocks have adopted.\n\nThe following bargain companies have premier assets that will support production growth going forward. Furthermore, they are generating significant cash and returning it to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. These three stocks are the best energy stocks to buy for gains and returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTexas Pacific Land (TPL) a photo of vast farmland\n\nUnlike other energy companies that explore and produce oil and gas, Texas Pacific Land (NYSE:TPL) operates in a unique model. It leases its land to oil companies and earns royalties on the production of its land. This unique model allows it to transfer operating risks and helps it maintain best-in-class profit margins.\n\nConsidering its unique model, TPL stock should be on your list of the best energy stocks to buy. Texas Pacific Land owns 868,000 surface acres in Texas. Besides oil and gas royalties, it also draws revenues from water rights and leasing activities.\n\nSince Texas Pacific has minimal operating expenses and no capital burden, it generates high margins from its revenue streams. For instance, in 2023, revenues were $632 million and generated $541 million in adjusted EBITDA, translating into an impressive 86% margin. Free cash flow margins were also a high of 66%.\n\nDue to its efficient conversion of revenue to cash, this energy stock will continue to deliver impressive shareholder returns. Lastly, Texas Pacific will join the S&P MidCap 400 on June 24, creating demand from passive buyers.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron Earnings: CVX Stock Sinks Amid Spending Cuts\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil supermajor Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is in a top-tier group of the best energy stocks to buy. Besides its bargain at 12 times forward P/E, there has been progress regarding the Hess (NYSE:HES) acquisition. On May 28, a majority of Hess shareholders approved the $53 billion merger. Still, a Federal Trade Commission probe and an arbitration dispute are ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nIsolating the Hess problems, Chevron continues to execute flawlessly. In Q1 2024, it exhibited strong returns across the board, delivering 12% year-over-year worldwide production growth. However, earnings declined due to lower natural gas realizations and lower refined product margins.\n\nIn terms of return on capital employed, the oil giant continued its stellar record, achieving a return of more than 12%. On that note, it returned $6 billion to shareholders \u2014 $3 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchases. This was the eighth straight quarter of over $5 billion in shareholder returns.\n\nManagement also highlighted the huge growth opportunity from its Tengizchevroil affiliate in Kazakhstan. There has been significant progress in the Future Growth Project, with operations expected to commence in the first half of 2025. The company expects over one million barrels of oil equivalent per day once production starts. With FGP expected to generate $5 billion in annual free cash flow at $60 Brent crude, this oil major will continue its shareholder returns.\n\nDevon Energy (DVN) The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is at the nexus of the deal-making environment that has swept the Permian basin. There has been $194 billion worth of deals since July 2023, the major ones being ExxonMobil\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) $64.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and the $26 billion acquisition of Endeavor Energy Resources by Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG).\n\nAnalysts have argued that Devon missed out due to its production issues and higher drilling costs, which made its stock unattractive to takeover targets. However, some opine that it lost out to competitors due to its price discipline. If so, that\u2019s a positive since it reflects management\u2019s commitment to preserving shareholder value.\n\nAs of this writing, Devon and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) are the largest U.S. oil and gas producers that haven\u2019t struck a deal. Still, there are plenty of smaller targets that Devon could pursue that would be accretive. Moreover, it could also become a target itself from larger players. Either way, Devon is one of the best energy stocks to buy at these levels.\n\nAt a forward P/E of 9 and a trailing EV/EBITDA multiple of 5, DVN stock presents a significant opportunity for bargain hunters. An acquisition could add considerable value, or Devon could be acquired at a substantial premium.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Justice Department said it returned an additional $156 million in misappropriated 1MDB funds to Malaysia, a month after the Southeast Asian nation sought extra compensation from US authorities.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Apple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Tesla Investors Back Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Deal, Texas Move Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable. Tech Powers Stocks as Adobe Surges in Late Trading: Markets Wrap\n\nThat brings the total amount the DOJ has repatriated to Malaysia to about $1.4 billion, according to a statement on the department\u2019s website late Thursday. Malaysia in May said it was entitled to additional funds from US authorities after the latter formally ended their criminal case with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for its role in the 1MDB scandal.\n\nLooting of the 1MDB investment fund by officials in Malaysia after Goldman helped it raise money spawned a multibillion-dollar scandal and probes across continents. Funds that 1MDB held, as well as proceeds of bonds issued for and on behalf of it, were spent on a variety of extravagant items including luxury homes, a superyacht, and fine art by Monet and Van Gogh, according to the DOJ.\n\nThe DOJ has seized $1.7 billion in stolen assets linked to 1MDB since 2016, and continues to litigate actions against additional assets allegedly linked to the scheme, it said Thursday. Malaysia had previously criticized the US efforts, saying the amount recovered and repatriated was far less than the total $4.5 billion misappropriated.\n\n1MDB has initiated lawsuits against multiple parties in recent months to claw back lost funds, including against the wife of jailed former prime minister Najib Razak. Malaysia is also seeking additional payments from Goldman, which reached a deal with the country that eases the bank\u2019s financial burden if missing funds are recouped.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "AstraZeneca (AZN) has long been in the oncology and other disease spaces, but rose to popularity in recent years with the success of its COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe company has since withdrawn the vaccine due to low demand and rare side effects, but is once again an investor favorite after sharing recent data on its cancer drugs.\n\nOne of its best-performing lung cancer drugs, Tagrisso, first approved in 2017, has proven it can reduce the risk of disease progression by 84% in patients with a type of Stage 3 lung cancer. Those results won it a standing ovation from attendees at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago. The company also revealed a CAR-T therapy candidate \u2014 an immunotherapy that is crafted from a person's own immune system to fight cancer \u2014 that could reduce tumors in liver cancer patients. In addition, the company is working on a new breast cancer treatment. A bottle of Tagrisso on a table at a home in Deerfield, Ill. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAll of this means the company is gearing up for several launches and label expansions \u2014 and new revenue streams. AstraZeneca has set a target to become an $80 billion company, in sales, by 2030. In 2023, the company booked $45.8 billion in revenue.\n\nCFO Aradhana Sarin said she is now focused on the execution of launching the products after the data reveal.\n\n\"We've come a long way in our oncology portfolio, but we've also come a long way when you see the depth of the portfolio,\" Sarin told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs annual healthcare conference in Miami Beach. Sarin added that the company isn't done yet, with more data due in the next 18 months.\n\nIn the past six months, the company's stock has surged nearly 20%, trading at $79 per share Thursday.\n\nSarin said the company is going to achieve its revenue goal, and not by relying on one or two blockbusters. It is the story the company told at its May investor day, where stakeholders initially felt confused about the wide variety of products the company was highlighting.\n\n\"For us, when it comes to communication, it's a balancing act between making it simple enough so people can digest it, but also highlighting that it's not one or two products that make or break this company. It's a huge breadth and depth of product,\" Sarin said.\n\nShe added, \"My role is to make sure that we have good data and good analysis to support decisions that we discuss and debate\" in order to make the right choices.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Apple on Tuesday revealed a new way for customers to take out loans. Buried deep in a press release on new software products available this fall, the Cupertino-based firm shared that users in the U.S. will be able to \u201capply for loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay.\u201d Affirm Holdings, a San Francisco-based fintech that lets users spread out payments over months without incurring late fees or interest\u2014a proccess called \u201cbuy now, pay later,\u201d or BNPL\u2014confirmed the deal in investor documents.\n\nAffirm\u2019s stock jumped 11% on Tuesday to a high of $33.98, still well below its $52.48 high over the past year. Since then, the stock reached a high of $38.16 and was trading near $36 at time of publication.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about the partnership is Apple already has a bank providing very similar services: Goldman Sachs. But multiplereports that cite people with knowledge of the matter have said the relationship is on the rocks\u2014and could be on ice by this fall. Though Apple didn't respond to requests for comment on whether the deal with Goldman would continue, it did confirm the Affirm deal won't change those plans, whatever they are. Goldman didn't respond to request for comment. But multiple analysts who spoke to Fortune are operating under the assumption the deal is off\u2014or soon will be.\n\nBy all outward appearances, the Affirm partnership looks like a great replacement for Goldman\u2019s BNPL offering, according to Gil Luria, managing director of the wealth management firm D.A. Davidson. After all, U.S. regulators said last month they would treat BNPL the same as credit cards. While fintechs like Affirm may not replace banks in the eyes of users, they, and the network of smaller, mostly state banks that support them, could someday soon compete with the largest banks in the world.\n\n\u201cFrom a regulatory perspective, and really from an intellectual perspective, there's not a lot of difference between a credit card product and a 'buy now, pay later' product,\u201d says Luria. \u201cIn terms of the consumer perception, they are different products. And so it's hard to imagine that Apple will not have a credit card offering as part of its Apple wallet, even if it is providing a consumer credit through another type of product.\u201d\n\nPayPal cofounder Max Levchin founded Affirm in March 2012 to build new kinds of payments products enabled by the internet. Almost right out of the gate, it competed against Apple. In October 2014,\u00a0Apple launched Apple Pay to let customers use their iPhones to pay with credit cards issued by Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Citi, and Wells Fargo.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fall of 2016, Affirm launched a service that let people choose how they wanted to pay for goods, which morphed into what is now known as BNPL. Apple countered three years later by joining forces with Goldman Sachs to offer an almost identical product. The offering was so similar that when Apple last year made it available in the U.S., Reuters described the event as threatening to fintechs like Affirm.\n\nWhile both Affirm's and Apple\u2019s services sound an awful lot like a credit card minus the card, neither was regulated as such.\n\nThough Apple doesn't charge users fees, most BNPL companies make money through some combination of fees to users and merchants. Apple doesn\u2019t break down its BNPL revenue, but Fortune Business Insights estimates the total market was $30 billion last year. Despite the promising revenue stream, just eight months after the Goldman partnership was publicized, Apple reportedly gave the investment bank a plan whereby the deal could be unwound by as early as November.\n\nEnter Affirm. The same day Affirm publicized the partnership, the company\u2019s site elaborated: \u201cLater this year, eligible U.S. customers checking out online or in-app with Apple Pay on iPhone and iPad will be able to apply to pay over time with Affirm for eligible transactions.\u201d\n\nTo help fulfill customer loans, Affirm works with FDIC-insured, state-chartered private banks like Cross River Bank, from New Jersey, Celtic Bank from Utah, and Lead Bank from Missouri. In April, Memphis-based Evolve Bank and Trust, which issues the Affirm card, had customer funds associated with pig-butchering scams seized. It also provided banking services for fintech Synapse, which went bankrupt in May. Evolve didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat same month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent U.S. government agency regulating the financial sector, determined that BNPL lenders are credit card providers and \u201cmust provide consumers some key legal protections and rights that apply to conventional credit cards.\u201d While the additional costs of complying with the regulation will likely eat into Affirm's bottom line, a written response from the company said the decision \u201caligned with responsibly extending access to credit.\u201d\n\nThough regulators now view credit cards and BNPL as the same thing, Luria says the perception that they are different will likely lead Apple to seek a new, more traditional banking partner\u2014should the Goldman deal officially dissolve: \u201cIt's very safe to assume that Apple will not have a hard time finding a replacement.\u201d\n\nIf the Goldman deal does evaporate, there are dozens of potential candidates to replace it, including Providence-based Citizens Bank. Nationally chartered, Citizens is one of the few publicly traded banks working with Apple. Since 2014, it's been letting its users prove their identity using the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint technology and provides financing for customers who want to upgrade phones. Citizens has $222 billion in assets. A bank representative says that contrary to other reports, the services are neither a credit card nor BNPL, and the Affirm deal won't impact the firm's work. \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate any changes,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nState-chartered Green Dot Bank has $5.3 billion in assets and provides banking services for Apple Cash, which lets users send each other money. A Green Dot representative also confirms the relationship will continue unchanged.\n\nApple having so many banking partners only makes sense, according Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. Ives says the increasingly competitive series of financial products offered by Apple is likely intentional\u2014it's designed to more efficiently capitalize on the iPhone\u2019s estimated 1 billion users.\n\n\u201cApple has many partnerships, and they do not bet solely on one partner,\u201d says Ives. \u201cThis a smart move by Cupertino in this space: Bet on the winners, and one will emerge.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Exclusive-Goldman Sachs aims to double lending to wealthy private bank clients",
        "content": "By Saeed Azhar\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs aims to double its lending over the next five years to ultra-wealthy private bank clients with account sizes exceeding $10 million, as it gathers more deposits to supercharge lending, the bank's private banking chief told Reuters.\n\nThe plans, previously unreported, were disclosed to Reuters by Nishi Somaiya, Goldman's global head of private banking, lending and deposits. The Wall Street giant wants to make more loans to wealthy individuals and families for big purchases, ranging from luxury homes to sports teams, as part of its strategy to bolster its wealth management operations.\n\nGoldman declined to quantify the full scope of its lending to wealthy clients, who typically have a net worth of at least $30 million. The private bank's outstanding loans stood at $33 billion in the first quarter. That does not capture other undisclosed commitments, which could add more to the total.\n\n\"We were not really focused on lending to our private wealth clients -- we did a little bit of it, but it wasn't a big focus,\" CEO David Solomon told Reuters in an interview. \"They have borrowing needs and we're well positioned to serve them competitively.\"\n\nThe lending push is a silver lining from Goldman's ill-fated consumer business. While the expansion into retail banking largely flopped and was unpopular among some employees and investors, it still attracted a surge of deposits into consumer savings accounts.\n\nGoldman's total deposits jumped to $441 billion in the first quarter, with over 39% coming from consumer accounts, versus $190 billion in total deposits at the end of 2019.\n\nThose deposits have also been put to use as a cheap source of funding for Goldman's markets division.\n\nThe unit posted record growth in financing in the first quarter for trading and private equity clients, by providing short-term loans to clients using their holdings such as real estate assets or securities as collateral.\n\nAs its deposits swelled, \"we have grown, and will continue to grow, lending across our institutional businesses,\" Somaiya said.\n\nGoldman's lending in wealth management as a percentage of its wealth client assets is 3%, well below an average of 9%among its peers, according to a report by Autonomous Research.\n\nBank of America's total outstanding loans and leases to wealth management clients stood at around $220 billion at the end of its last financial year, similar to JPMorgan Chase's.\n\n\"There's a real opportunity for us to grow in our private banking activities,\" given that gap, Somaiya said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe expansion of lending to wealthy individuals who have assets of at least $30 million, as well as to private equity firms and asset managers, helps Goldman broaden its business beyond trading and investment banking.\n\n\"This is a way to increase their wallet share of a client who they already have a relationship with,\" said Ebrahim Poonawala, banking analyst at Bank of America.\n\n\"You deepen the client relationship, you create sticky revenue.\"\n\nInvestors will watch to see if the wealth lending improves the return on equity (ROE) for the bank's broader asset and wealth management division.\n\nGoldman has set a target to boost the unit's ROE from a current 9.9% to a mid-teens percentage in the medium term.\n\nIts asset management division is also making more loans using outside money from investors instead of the bank's own balance sheet.\n\nGoldman Sachs Asset Management set a goal to more than double its private credit portfolio to $300 billion in five years.\n\nLending is seen as a strategic tool to expand Goldman's services to its ultra-high net worth clients who have a broad choice of lenders and are infrequent borrowers. \"We can provide them leverage often against illiquid assets, if they need lending for an acquisition - home, hobby, another company, sports team - or want to use a margin loan against securities to invest more,\" Somaiya said.\n\nFor instance, wealthy clients can use their holdings of alternative assets or art hanging on their walls as collateral for the loans, she added. \"We are creating liquidity for a rainy day,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Saeed Azhar, additional reporting by Lananh Nguyen; Editing by David Gregorio)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Goldman falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $8.87 per share, indicating a change of +188% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.57 points to a change of +59.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $39.79 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Goldman is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Goldman, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.71 billion and $53.87 billion estimates indicate +11.8% and +4.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.26%. The EPS surprise was +35.6%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGoldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "With 72% ownership, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) boasts of strong institutional backing",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Goldman Sachs Group's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership Insiders have sold recently\n\nIf you want to know who really controls The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goldman Sachs Group.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Goldman Sachs Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Goldman Sachs Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Goldman Sachs Group. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs Group\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$737m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group  you should know about.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

        "title": "Is Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF (GLOV) a Strong ETF Right Now?",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF (GLOV) was launched on 03/15/2022, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the market.\n\nWhat Are Smart Beta ETFs?\n\nFor a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.\n\nMarket cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.\n\nBut, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.\n\nBased on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.\n\nMethodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.\n\nFund Sponsor & Index\n\nManaged by Goldman Sachs Funds, GLOV has amassed assets over $886.73 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the GOLDMAN SACHS ACTBT WORLD LW VL PL EQ ID.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity Index delivers exposure to large and mid-capitalization equity securities of developed market issuers, including the United States.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nGLOV's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.89%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.\n\nTaking into account individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 2.87% of the fund's total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY).\n\nIts top 10 holdings account for approximately 13.96% of GLOV's total assets under management.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nSo far this year, GLOV return is roughly 7.26%, and was up about 18.32% in the last one year (as of 06/10/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $38.70 and $47.02.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.76 and standard deviation of 13.54% for the trailing three-year period. With about 383 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\n\nIShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $18.70 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $36.52 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Utility Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "The Vanguard Utilities Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU) is up by about 9% year-to-date, suggesting that utility stocks have garnered fundamental support. The question now becomes: Are utility stocks overvalued, or are additional gains in store?\n\nI, for one, believe utility stocks still have more to offer. My basis is that the U.S. economic outlook is uncertain, therefore lending the argument that investors will emphasize defensive sectors until further ado.\n\nUtility stocks provide solid fixed-income proxies, due to their low volatility and high dividend yields. Given the instability embedded in today\u2019s fixed-income markets, utility assets are set to gain popularity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWell, if your vision aligns with mine, then here are three undervalued utility stocks to consider.\n\nGlobal Water Resources (GWRS) A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.\n\nSource: khak/ShutterStock.com\n\nGlobal Water Resources (NASDAQ:GWRS) owns and operates more than 29 water resource systems. The firm primarily offers water recycling and wastewater services in the United States. However, Global Water Resources has the potential to expand, due to the growing demand for industrial water efficiency.\n\nThe driving force behind Global Water Resources is its fundamental attributes. For example, the company is on a margin expansion journey, whereby its earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, expanded by 4.5% to $5.4 million in its previous fiscal quarter.\n\nMoreover, Global Water Resources has a return on common equity ratio, or ROE, of 13.34%, 47.63% higher than the sector median, illustrating its operational efficiency.\n\nSome might argue that Global Water Resources\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio of 50.92x means it is fundamentally overvalued. However, I beg to differ.\n\nAlthough elevated, GWRS stock\u2019s P/E ratio is at a five-year discount of 69.40%, conveying relative value. The stock has a forward dividend yield of 2.46%, which adds a floor to its stock price.\n\nGlobal Water Resources\u2019 stock is set to prosper due to systematic and idiosyncratic support.\n\nEnbridge (ENB) Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnbridge (NYSE:ENB) is a Canadian infrastructure company focused on Liquid Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, Renewable Power Generation and Energy Services.\n\nInfrastructure stocks usually have long-term investor bases, which stabilizes their stock prices. Additionally, infrastructure funds often act as fixed-income proxies, due to their dividend yields.\n\nEnbridge is no different with a forward dividend yield of 7.39%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe abovementioned shows that Enridge is a stable, high-income stock. However, is ENB stock undervalued?\n\nWell, its fundamental attributes and valuation metrics suggest it is. For example, Enbridge recently delivered a promising first-quarter earnings report, communicating an earning-per-share beat of eight cents, placing its price-to-earnings-growth ratio at merely 0.15x.\n\nEnbridge also has a scintillating leveraged free cash flow margin of 9.11%, suggesting its economic value is intact.\n\nENB stock has traded relatively flat since the turn of the year. However, its fundamental zeal, stability and alluring dividend yield place it in the best-in-class territory.\n\nAmerican Electric Power Company (AEP) the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a website\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final stock on today\u2019s list is American Electric Power Company (NASDAQ:AEP), which recently earned a \u201cbuy\u201d rating from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). According to Goldman Sachs, AEP is among a few stocks set to benefit from near-term power demand growth.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 outlook makes sense. American Electric Power has established itself as a key player in the energy supply arena with a broad-based market share of 5.21%.\n\nAdding on to that, the firm has converted its market stronghold into tangible results. For instance, AEP stock\u2019s ROE of 11.36% is 25.74% higher than the sector median, showcasing its impressive shareholder value creation.\n\nFurthermore, AEP stock holds a strong posture after its first-quarter earnings report and concurrent guidance. The company delivered $5 billion in quarterly revenue, a 5% year-over-year increase.\n\nAEP\u2019s first-quarter earnings-per-share surpassed its estimate by two cents. As for the firm\u2019s guidance, American Electric Power Company stated that it anticipates a long-term growth rate between 6% and 7%, adding allure to this already highly touted stock.\n\nLastly, AEP stock looks good from a capital markets perspective. More specifically, its PEG ratio of 0.42x illustrates GARP, while its dividend yield of 3.99% is highly respectable.\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As we enter June 2024, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to be a closely watched barometer of the U.S. stock market. In this article, we will explore the three best Dow stocks to consider adding to your portfolio this month.\n\nThese stocks have been selected based on a thorough analysis of their fundamentals, market positioning, and future prospects.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the Dow are not strictly rules-based like some other indexes but rather based on the discretion of the Averages Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. When deciding which companies to include sector representation, company size, financial stability, and more, the committee considers several factors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOwning these best Dow stocks could potentially help investors\u2019 overall and risk-adjusted returns over the long run. That said, here are three of the best Dow stocks to buy.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) produces medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.\n\nJNJ operates globally with three main segments. Pharmaceuticals is the largest segment, accounting for over 50% of total revenue. Major products include Remicade, Stelara, and Imbruvica.\n\nJNJ projects 2024 sales growth of 5-6%. Additionally, they expect EPS to be between $10.45 and $10.65. The pharmaceutical segment is anticipated to grow the most, driven by strong performance from key drugs like Stelara and Tremfya.\n\nThe main reason to hold JNJ is its stability and income potential. JNJ offers a dividend yield of 3.36%, with an annual dividend payout of $4.96 per share. Moreover, the payout ratio stands at 30%, which is very sustainable. JNJ has demonstrated a dividend growth rate of 5.02%, sustained over an impressive 62 years of consecutive increases. Additionally, the company has a buyback yield of 6.73%, contributing to a total shareholder yield of 10.12%.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is another Dow stock that investors should pay attention to. It has continued to see growth in 2024, focusing on expanding its digital payment network. The company had revenue growth of 9%, reaching $8.8 billion. Moreover, GAAP net income rose by 10% to $4.7 billion, with EPS at $2.29\u200b.\n\nAnalysts rate Visa stock as \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The consensus price target is $316, indicating a 13% upside from the current price of around $279\u200b.\n\nThe main reason I\u2019m bullish on Visa, though, is that it\u2019s exploring numerous growth tailwinds.\n\nVisa has entered partnerships with several major financial institutions and fintech companies, including a collaboration with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to integrate Visa\u2019s payment services with Goldman\u2019s transaction banking platform. They also partnered with fintech firm Thunes to enable faster cross-border payments for businesses and consumers in emerging markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis then positions Visa strongly both in the short and long-term timeframes.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) excels in cloud computing and software solutions. It\u2019s also one of the best Dow stocks I recommend and my favorite in the FAANG acronym.\n\nThe company grew revenue by approximately 17%, reaching $61.9 billion in Q3 FY2024. Microsoft is getting a significant boost from its Azure and other cloud services. They also plan to expand their artificial intelligence and machine learning offerings\u200b.\n\nI think the best has yet to come for MSFT stock. It recently announced partnerships with several financial institutions and tech companies to enhance its cloud and AI capabilities. In just Q3, Microsoft returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and I feel that it will only grow in income potential as time goes on, which is great for long-term holders. Thus, I think it is one of the best Dow stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMatthew started writing coverage of the financial markets during the crypto boom of 2017 and was also a team member of several fintech startups.

        "content": "In May, Barron\u2019s published an article titled Week\u2019s Best: Dow 50,000 or Bust? At the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 40,000, a record for 30 of America\u2019s oldest companies. That got me thinking about Dow stocks to buy.\n\nOf the three major indexes, the Dow is the worst performer in 2024, up less than 3% on the year, compared to 12.8% for the S&P 500 and 14.8% for the Nasdaq 100. However, it got closer over the past year but widened again over the past five years.\n\nThis suggests that you\u2019ll need to be very selective about which of the 30 Dow stocks you buy, given their failure to deliver in the near and long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLooking at Finviz.com\u2019s performance data for the Dow 30, just nine stocks are in positive territory for all periods: five days, one month, the latest quarter, six months, 52 weeks, and year-to-date (YTD).\n\nHere are the three best to buy now.\n\nDow Stocks to Buy: Goldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock is up nearly 19% YTD and 44% over the past year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe I would choose an investment bank as one of my three Dow stocks. However, the company\u2019s Q1 2024 results demonstrate the overall business performance.\n\nIn the first quarter, its revenues were 16% higher to $14.21 billion, with Global Banking & Markets growing by 15% to $9.73 billion, or 68% of its overall revenue. Its investment banking fees accounted for 21% of the segment\u2019s quarterly revenue. The segment\u2019s net earnings were $3.53 billion, 18% higher year-over-year (YOY).\n\nAn example of the kinds of businesses that Goldman Sachs is involved in is Apex, the company\u2019s family office subsidiary, which is part of its Asset & Wealth Management segment. Thanks to the success of Wrexham AFC, the Welsh soccer club actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought for $2.5 million in 2020, family offices are all over sports investments.\n\nThe discussion around the broader sports ecosystem is continuing to be a big area of focus for family offices,\u201d Fortune quoted Anushka Gupta, the head of Apex.\n\nGS continues to have its fingers in many pies. Eighteen of the 26 analysts who cover GS stock rate it a Buy.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock is up more than 26% YTD and 34% over the past year. Finviz.com says it is the seventh-best Dow stock over the past year.\n\nYou know business must be good at Walmart when it ratchets up the perks and payouts to employees. On June 5, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner and Chief Talent Officer Lo Stomski announced new investments in its employees, the discount retailer\u2019s most important asset.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cFor Walmart to be the best place to shop, we also need it to be the best place to work. That idea is the North Star of our journey to build a better company for our associates,\u201d stated Walmart\u2019s press release.\n\nSomebody from Walmart management must have spied on a Costco (NASDAQ:COST) management meeting. Costco has been treating its employees well since the beginning, which is why Charlie Munger loved it so much.\n\nThe reality is that Walmart\u2019s already upped its investment in its employees \u2014 since 2019, it\u2019s raised its average U.S. hourly wage to nearly $18, a 30% increase over the past five years \u2014 but the four latest moves take it up a notch.\n\nHowever, the most shocking is the introduction of bonuses for its hourly full-time and part-time staff, the first ever from Walmart. Depending on tenure, the annual bonus could reach $1,000 annually.\n\nThat might not seem like much to big whigs on Wall Street, but it will make a difference to front-line employees.\n\nPerhaps after many years of failing to do so, Walmart is finally trying to live up to Sam Walton\u2019s vision for the company.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing if you own WMT stock.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast on the list of Dow stocks to buy is 3M (NYSE:MMM). Its stock is up nearly 8% YTD and 21% over the past year.\n\nThe industrial conglomerate is most certainly the contrarian play of the three. However, considering how much its business has changed in the past few years, it becomes less contrarian than you might think.\n\n3M is traditionally known for consumer products such as Scotch tape and Post-it Notes. However, some of its other businesses, such as industrial adhesives and reflective tape, have delivered poor margins and revenue growth.\n\nIn 2024, the company has made significant changes to reenergize the overall business and return to growth by focusing on fewer, more profitable businesses.\n\nOn April 1, it completed the spinoff of Solventum (NYSE:SOLV), its healthcare business. 3M shareholders got one SOLV share for every four 3M shares. It continues to own nearly 20% of Solventum, which it will sell over the next five years. On May 1, Bill Brown took over as CEO from Mike Roman, who became executive chairman. Brown most recently was CEO of L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX).\n\nA reduced annual dividend payment of $2.80 yields a reasonable 2.8%. The company intends to devote about 40% of its annual free cash flow to dividends, with the rest for share repurchases, debt repayment, acquisitions, and investing in its existing businesses.\n\nIts price-to-sales ratio of 1.67 is cheaper is cheaper than in the past decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC) a Strong ETF Right Now?",
        "content": "Designed to provide broad exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend category of the market, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 06/28/2017.\n\nWhat Are Smart Beta ETFs?\n\nFor a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.\n\nMarket cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.\n\nThere are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.\n\nNon-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.\n\nEven though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.\n\nFund Sponsor & Index\n\nThe fund is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds. GSSC has been able to amass assets over $482.74 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Blend. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.\n\nWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.20%.\n\nIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.35%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.\n\nGSSC's heaviest allocation is in the Industrials sector, which is about 19.90% of the portfolio. Its Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen you look at individual holdings, Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) accounts for about 1.81% of the fund's total assets, followed by Jun 24 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYM24) and Comfort Systems Usa Inc (FIX).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 6.02% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nThe ETF has gained about 0.99% so far this year and is up roughly 13.69% in the last one year (as of 06/07/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $51.83 and $65.55.\n\nThe fund has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 20.98% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1297 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\n\nIShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) tracks Russell 2000 Index and the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) tracks S&P SmallCap 600 Index. IShares Russell 2000 ETF has $59.83 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF has $78.27 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Blend.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Dividend Aristocrats in Disguise: 3 Stocks With Royal Payout Potential",
        "content": "Currently, there are only 68 companies that boast the esteemed title of Dividend Aristocrat. Among a couple of other, more trivial requirements, a company must be a member of the S&P 500 index and have raised its dividend payout for a minimum of 25 consecutive years. This is opening the door for some of the top dividend aristocrats\n\nWith a long track record of sustained growth in shareholder returns, often including more than one recession, these companies have proven their ability to endure market downturns and emerge even stronger on the other side.\n\nHowever, in this article, we will look beyond the confines of these renowned Aristocrats and explore companies that, while not officially crowned, seem to have the potential for royal payouts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three dividend stocks may not yet possess the long dividend growth history of dividend aristocrats, but they still feature promising qualities that could elevate them to this status in the future. My main criteria here were companies that have increased their dividend for at least 12 years and have a 10-year dividend compound dividend growth rate (CAGR) of at least 15%.\n\nTractor Supply (TSCO) A Tractor Supply Co. Store\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) narrowly secured its place on my list. It has raised its dividend for the minimum requirement of 12 consecutive years. Yet, excluding Tractor Supply wasn\u2019t an option, primarily due to its remarkable pace of dividend growth in recent years. Notably, the company boasts a five-year dividend CAGR of nearly 29%, showcasing its impressive trajectory.\n\nMoving forward, Tractor Supply\u2019s earnings growth prospects remain robust, suggesting that its dividend will continue to grow at quite attractive rates. The two major catalysts for that comprise maximizing sales in existing locations and opening new stores in untapped markets.\n\nConcerning the latter, the company opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and four new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the first quarter of 2024. Also, as part of its capital plans for the entire year, the company expects to open about 80 fresh Tractor Supply stores, establish its 10th distribution center, and open 10 to 15 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores during FY2024.\n\nWith an exceptional track record of dividend growth and a well-defined strategy for future expansion, Tractor Supply appears poised to become a future Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) is another suitable example of a dividend stock that meets my criteria. It has elevated its dividend for 12 consecutive years, emphasizing management\u2019s commitment to growing shareholder returns. Importantly, its dividend growth trajectory has been nothing short of explosive over the past five years. During this time, its dividend has grown at a CAGR of about 28%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis notable dividend growth can be traced to some great strategic moves that have driven strong financial results in recent years. To add some color, the company has successfully expanded its offerings and market reach through the acquisition of boutique investment firms like United Capital in 2019 and Folio Financial in 2020. These additions enhanced its wealth management division.\n\nMoreover, the company has capitalized on the booming demand for technology-driven financial services by investing heavily in digital platforms. One such example is Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which has seen rapid customer growth and was named first for customer satisfaction in this year\u2019s J.D. Power U.S. Direct Banking Satisfaction Study.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a truly wonderful company. Along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA), the two companies have virtually duo-polized the payments processing network market. Most of us have at least a couple of cards from each network company in our physical and digital wallets.\n\nTheir unbelievable moat, combined with the natural tailwind of society going cashless, has allowed both companies to grow rapidly and enjoy massive profit margins. In turn, their dividend growth has also been quite impressive. In the case of Visa, consecutive dividend increases have taken place for 15 years in a row, with its CAGR over the past five standing at a notable 16%.\n\nThe gradual societal shift from physical cash to digital currency is likely to unfold over the course of years, potentially spanning decades. Further, Visa\u2019s percentage-based fee model inherently enables it to benefit from inflation. Hence, Visa should easily sustain its current double-digit earnings and dividend growth trajectory. With such promising prospects, it\u2019s also likely that Visa will become a Dividend Aristocrat about 10 years from now. If you are going to buy any of these dividend aristocrats, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) ended the recent trading session at $455.30, demonstrating a +0.07% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.15%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.36%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.17%.\n\nThe investment bank's shares have seen an increase of 2.55% over the last month, not keeping up with the Finance sector's gain of 2.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.2%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Goldman Sachs in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on July 15, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $8.87, indicating a 187.99% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $12.76 billion, showing a 17.12% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $36.57 per share and revenue of $51.71 billion. These totals would mark changes of +59.9% and +11.81%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.4% higher within the past month. Goldman Sachs presently features a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, Goldman Sachs currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.44. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 18.08.\n\nWe can also see that GS currently has a PEG ratio of 0.92. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Investment Bank industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.14 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 12, this industry ranks in the top 5% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Production cuts will continue in full in the third quarter and then be gradually phased out over the following 12 months, the Saudi Energy Ministry said after OPEC+\u2019s weekend meeting.\n\nThe agreement aims to keep supporting oil prices while easing the production restraints against which some members \u2014 such as the United Arab Emirates \u2014 have chafed as they sought to have their output levels upgraded. Most market watchers had expected curbs to continue until the end of the year.\n\nOil capped a monthly loss on Friday on mounting concerns over China\u2019s demand outlook and as crude supplies from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies swell. The prompt spread for Brent briefly slipped into a bearish contango structure last week, and money managers have been trimming bets on rising prices.\n\nWeakness is being reflected in products markets, with the profits for making fuels such as diesel on the decline. Structural factors such as new refineries in the Middle East coming online have helped to depress prices.\n\nFutures are still higher this year after geopolitical tensions from the Middle East to Ukraine raised concerns about supply.

Those curbs come in addition to a group-wide agreement capping total crude output at about 39 million barrels a day, which the alliance is also discussing extending into 2025, the delegates said, asking not to be named because the talks were private.\n\nOPEC+ ministers are gathering on Sunday for a hybrid meeting to decide oil policy, with some attending in-person talks in Riyadh and others participating online. Traders and analysts have widely expected the extension of the group\u2019s cuts, seeing it as necessary to offset soaring production from several of OPEC+\u2019s rivals \u2014 most notably US shale drillers \u2014 and a fragile economic outlook in top consumer, China.\n\nWhile crude prices briefly soared above $90 a barrel in April as conflict in the Middle East threatened regional exports, they\u2019ve since declined. Brent futures settled at $81.62 a barrel on May 31, a drop of 7.1% for the month.\n\nLower oil prices have offered some relief to central banks grappling with persistent inflation, but threaten revenue for producers like Saudi Arabia. The kingdom needs prices close to $100 a barrel to fund the ambitious spending plans of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the International Monetary Fund estimates.\n\nOil market indicators have likely impressed the need for caution on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. The premium on prompt Brent contracts \u2014 known to traders as \u201cbackwardation\u201d \u2014 has been dwindling, suggesting that world markets are tipping from scarcity into surplus.\n\n--With assistance from Ben Bartenstein and Salma El Wardany.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track Israel Seeks Underground Secrets by Tracking Cosmic Particles US Malls Avoid Death Spiral With Help of Japanese Video Arcades How Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Could Be a Great Choice",
        "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nGoldman Sachs in Focus\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 16.71% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $2.75 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.44%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.67%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.58%.\n\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $11 is up 4.8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 26.83%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 43%, meaning it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nGS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $36.57 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 59.90%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +4.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nGoldman is expected to post earnings of $8.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +188%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $36.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +59.9%. This estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $39.79 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Goldman.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.76 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.1%. The $51.71 billion and $53.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.8% and +4.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.26%. The EPS surprise was +35.6%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGoldman is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Those who invested in Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) five years ago are up 168%",
        "content": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) which saw its share price drive 137% higher over five years. On top of that, the share price is up 16% in about a quarter.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Goldman Sachs Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 1.1% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 19% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on Goldman Sachs Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Goldman Sachs Group, it has a TSR of 168% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Goldman Sachs Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 43% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "S&P 500\u2019s robust performance in the first 100 days of 2024 suggests a bullish outlook for the remainder of the year, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts. As markets continue to grind higher, Wall Street analysts are actively issuing analyst upgrades, revisiting their research coverage to update ratings and reflect the optimistic market trends.\n\nAccording to BofA, when the S&P 500 rises more than 10% within the first 100 days, the index typically continues to perform well, with a 76% probability of further gains and an average return of 7.1%. The bank projects the S&P 500 could reach between 5640 and 5750 by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cWhen the SPX trades higher over the first 100 days of a Presidential election year, the rest of the year tends to be strong with the index up 93% on an average return of 10.1% (SPX 5800) and a median return of 8.9% (SPX 5730),\u201d the analysts said.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe markets hitting record highs come when hedge funds have started to sell U.S. equities at a rate not seen since early January. That marks a significant change after five consecutive weeks of net buying.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 (NYSE:GS) analysis indicates this selling trend aligns with recent positive economic growth signs and a firm stance from the Federal Reserve, suggesting that interest rates may remain elevated for an extended period. The sell-off was broad-based, affecting all 11 U.S. sectors.\n\nDespite the widespread declines, some stocks have shown remarkable resilience. Let\u2019s now look at the top three stocks that have soared following significant analyst upgrades.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMizuho analysts upgraded Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) from Neutral to Buy, raising the price target from $85.00 to $115.00. Rakesh noted that Microchip has faced significant challenges, with three consecutive quarters of declining top-line guidance and gross margins dropping from 68% to 60%.\n\nHowever, the analysts see potential for recovery as inventory levels begin to stabilize, potentially leading to improvements in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. Despite concerns about OEMs shifting from MCU to Arm-based processors, Mizuho remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cWe believe MCHP could see tailwinds into 2025E with a cyclical recovery as MCUs and Analog supply chains improve,\u201d the upgrade report said.\n\nThe analyst believes Microchip could benefit from a cyclical recovery in the MCU and analog supply chains, justifying the upgrade to Buy and the increased price target. Analysts also raised their rating on NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI).\n\nStory continues\n\nDuPont de Nemours (DD) The logo for DuPont (DD).\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analysts issued significant upgrades for DuPont de Nemours (NYSE:DD), elevating it from Equal Weight to Overweight, with a price target increase from $80.00 to $103.00. The upgrade followed DuPont\u2019s announcement that it will split into three publicly traded companies while the current CEO is set to retire.\n\nThe bank highlighted DuPont\u2019s potential for consistent growth across economic cycles, which could drive multiple expansions \u2014 a challenging feat for diversified chemical companies. The analyst believes the company\u2019s new entities will support mid-to-high teen multiples, reflecting stronger valuation metrics.\n\nAlthough it might take two years to fully execute the planned transactions, Wells Fargo anticipates that volume growth for each business segment will accelerate early in an economic recovery. That acceleration typically results in outperformance for chemical companies, positioning DuPont favorably.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) executed one of the more notable analyst upgrades, moving Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) from Underweight to Equal Weight, raising the price target from $98.00 to $130.00. Morgan Stanley was the biggest and only bear on the Street among large banks before admitting it was wrong on the memory chipmaker.\n\nDespite viewing Micron as fundamentally overvalued based on long-term discounted cash flow metrics, the broker acknowledges the positive impact of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on market sentiment. That sentiment is driving sustained pricing strength, and analyst Joseph Moore anticipates a potential positive earnings preannouncement this quarter.\n\nWhile the outlook for Micron remains optimistic, the company has faced a significant challenge with a $445 million patent trial verdict in favor of Netlist (OTCMKTS:NLST). However, Micron continues focusing on its HBM product development and aims to secure a larger share of the growing AI and high-performance computing markets.\n\nAlthough there are concerns that HBM supply may eventually become excessive, the market is still in the ramp-up phase. Additionally, Morgan Stanley is incrementally bullish on NAND flash memory, citing robust capital spending, which should be a significant growth driver next year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently published a list of7 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.\n\nSince GS is part of Loeb's top large-cap stock picks, the stock deserves a detailed look. But first let's see the latest performance of the billionaire.\n\nActivist investor and billionaire Dan Loeb made a comeback in the final quarter of 2023 after losing money during most of the year in addition to suffering losses in 2022. Wall Street Journal earlier this year reported that Loeb\u2019s Third Point, which he founded in 1995, gained between 7.8% to 8.6% in the December quarter. Third Point was also down 21% in 2022. Third Point was a star performer in the pandemic year as the fund closed 2020 up 19%, as Loeb foresaw the economy doing much better than many had expected.\n\nLoeb is known for his activist bets in high-profile companies Intel, Disney and Shell. Some of his bets were highly unsuccessful, while others paid off. Latest data shows Loeb is continuing to retain the Q4'2023 momentum into 2024. In his Q1 letter to investors, Loeb revealed that Third Point returned 7.8% in the flagship Offshore Fund.\n\nLoeb said in his Q1 letter that he's in the \"soft landing camp\" as he believes we are no longer in an inflationary environment. He's also highly bullish on AI, saying the technology favors the \"incumbents\" who are deploying massive cash \"war chests\" to win the \"AI arms race,\" a term the billionaire used twice in his letter. Loeb is betting on the whole AI spectrum \u2014 semiconductors, data centers, AI software and power.\n\nPhoto by Akshay Sadarangani on Unsplash\n\nFor this article we scanned Third Point\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top large-cap stock holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS)\n\nBillionaire Dan Loeb Q1'2024 Stake Value: $104,422,500\n\nBillionaire Dan Loeb had exited his position in Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS)\u00a0in early 2017. However, he came back to the stock in the first quarter of this year, buying 250,000 shares of the financial services giant, worth over $104.4 million. Over the past one year Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS)\u00a0shares have jumped about 39%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, BofA published its updated list of US-1 stocks. These are the Buy-rate stocks which are the top picks of BofA. The firm recommends these stocks for \u201csuperior investment performance\u201d over the long term. Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS)\u00a0was part of the list.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS)\u00a0is a strong dividend-paying stock, as the bank has increased its dividend every year since 2010.\n\nOf the 919 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 72 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS). The biggest stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS)\u00a0is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $2.4 billion stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS).\n\nAriel Focus Fund stated the following regarding The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGlobal investment bank,\u00a0The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), also increased in the period on solid earnings results. The top-line came in strong led by elevated financing activity and an improvement in advisory revenues, despite weak transaction volumes within the investment banking segment. Should conditions remain conducive, management remains cautiously optimistic the business will experience continued recovery in both capital markets and strategy activity. Meanwhile, GS continues to successfully execute on its strategic initiatives to improve the overall return of the company. It is right sizing headcount and narrowing its ambitions in consumer strategy through divestitures and an enhanced focus on driving profitability in Platform Solutions by 2025. With potential regulatory capital constraints from B3E, GS noted it will reign in buybacks over the short-term but maintain its dividend. Looking ahead, we continue to view the near and long-term outlook for Goldman as attractive at current levels, given favorable business trends, continued positive momentum on strategic initiatives and active expense/capital management programs.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:GS) ranks 6th in Insider Monkey\u2019s list of the7 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "2 Bank Stocks To Keep An Eye On Before June\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe financial sector is a cornerstone of the stock market, with bank stocks playing a pivotal role. These stocks represent shares in financial institutions, such as banks, that offer various services, including loans, deposits, asset management, and investment services.\n\nInvesting in bank stocks brings several advantages, including stability and consistent dividend payouts.\n\nThey appeal to income-oriented investors also because of their consistent dividends. In a rising interest rate environment, bank earnings also rise since they gain from the difference between deposit and loan rates.\n\nMoreover, the performance of bank stocks is closely related to domestic and international economic situations, making them vulnerable to financial crises and recession. Let\u2019s highlight two well-known big-cap bank stocks for your portfolio this week.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a global investment banking, securities, and management leader. It serves many clients, including corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals.\n\nRecent financial reports unveil Goldman Sachs\u2019 impressive performance in the first quarter of FY 2024, surpassing market expectations. With earnings reaching $11.58 per share and quarterly revenue totaling $32.16 billion, the institution outshined Wall Street projections, which anticipated earnings per share of $8.54 and revenue of $12.92 billion. This marks a significant 26.71% increase in revenue year-over-year.\n\nGoldman Sachs shares have gained 18.77% year to date in 2024. Early signs point to GS stock opening Tuesday\u2019s trading session at about $461.18 per share.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is among the most venerable and powerful organizations worldwide. It serves millions of individuals, small businesses, and a distinguished mix of corporate, institutional, and governmental clients.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. announced a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share on outstanding common stock. Provided they are registered as owners by the close of business on July 5, 2024, readers should expect this dividend payout on July 31, 2024. The annual dividend yield is 2.29% for those who make this choice.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s stock has surged by 16.64%, following a solid start to the year. Early signs point to a minor decline in JPM stock during premarket trading as markets prepare for Tuesday\u2019s business day; shares are around $200.37 each.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Debt Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\nThis article 2 Bank Stocks To Keep An Eye On Before June originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "With its diverse array of bank stocks, the financial sector has long been a cornerstone of investment portfolios. While the S&P 500 is the most popular benchmark for overall market performance, a few bank stocks can deliver superior returns through 2030.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this optimistic outlook, including higher interest rates, a robust economy and a surge in digital banking solutions. Investors increasingly recognize the potential for substantial gains in this sector, particularly as banks leverage new technologies like artificial intelligence. These elements combined suggest that strategically chosen bank stocks could offer significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the next decade.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the three best bank stocks to buy that outperform the S&P 500 through 2030!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest bank in the United States by assets, stands as a pillar of stability in the financial sector. Their diversified business model and strong liquidity make them well-positioned for domination in the banking sector.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s strong track record of profitability and prudent risk management practices have earned investors\u2019 trust. Jamie Dimon, who has been the CEO of the bank for nearly two decades, is one of the most trusted individuals on Wall Street. The company has particularly navigated tough macroeconomic conditions over the last 18 months.\n\nHigher interest rates have been advantageous for large U.S. banks, which continue to take advantage of this economic landscape. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 11% YOY to $40.07 billion. Net income increased 6% YOY to $13.42 billion, or $4.44 per share. With management raising their net interest income (NII) forecast to $91 billion for FY24, JPM stock remains one of the top bank stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), renowned for its investment banking prowess, has evolved into a diversified financial institution with a global footprint. The ongoing rebound in deal flow is a positive sign for the stock in 2024.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s expertise in mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt underwriting, and asset management positions it at the forefront of the industry. Their resilience over the last two years and ability to adapt to changing market conditions is a key strength. The company\u2019s asset management divisions have also seen impressive growth over the last several quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn their latest quarterly results, revenue increased 16% YOY to $14.21 billion. EPS increased 32% YOY to $11.58 per share, with assets under supervision hitting a record $2.85 trillion. Their asset and wealth management division continues to grow strongly, reflecting a higher appetite for risks as the broader stock market sees large inflows in 2024. This makes GS stock one of the top bank stocks in May.\n\niShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background. Fintech Stock Bargains\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroN\n\niShares U.S. Financials ETF (NYSEARCA:IYF), while not considered a \u201cstock,\u201d is a relatively safe way to gain exposure to the broader U.S. financial sector. This ETF seeks to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Financial Index, which includes a diverse range of U.S. banks, insurance companies and financial firms.\n\nThe iShares U.S. Financials ETF gives investors exposure to the U.S. financial sector. Its diversification helps mitigate company-specific risks, providing peace of mind for the more conservative investors. Its net AUM totaled approximately $2.6 billion and has an expense ratio of 0.40%. IYF\u2019s historical performance has closely mirrored the S&P 500\u2019s Financial Index. Furthermore, it allows investors to participate in the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s top five largest holdings include Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the ETF has averaged an 11% total return over the last decade. Investors looking for diversified exposure to bank stocks should strongly consider this ETF in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goldman Racks Up $21 Billion for Its Largest Private Credit Pool",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has put together $21 billion for private credit wagers, its biggest war chest yet for Wall Street\u2019s buzziest asset class.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century World\u2019s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar Treasuries Hit as US Sales Struggle to Lure Buyers: Markets Wrap New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers For Private Credit\u2019s Top Talent, $1 Million a Year Is Not Enough\n\nThe firm just closed the latest iteration of its direct-lending fund, drumming up firepower that includes fresh capital, borrowed funds and co-investments. That along with separately managed accounts will be put to use making more directly negotiated senior loans.\n\nFor money managers looking to expand, private credit has become one of their favorite calling cards. For Goldman, it takes on added importance, as it needs to prove it can rapidly raise mountains of money from outside investors, seeking steady fees over the big bursts of revenue once generated by wagering its own money.\n\nMarc Nachmann, in charge of Goldman\u2019s money-management operations, has been logging flight hours to reel in cash around the globe \u2014 from pension funds and insurance companies to sovereign wealth funds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go anywhere in the world where people want to talk to me,\u201d Nachmann said in an interview. \u201cThey all view this as a super interesting asset class. When you go back 10 years, none of them had big allocations to direct lending.\u201d\n\nThe latest fundraising marks the fifth iteration of the firm\u2019s Loan Partners fund, a series that got off the ground in 2008. The haul includes $13.1 billion of equity capital, long-term financing as well as some of Goldman\u2019s own balance sheet deployed alongside the commitments.\n\nThe firm also scored $500 million in co-investment vehicles that will deploy cash alongside the fund and $7 billion in separately managed accounts for the same senior-secured, direct lending strategy. Such accounts have been gaining popularity as they typically offer large capital allocators better terms and more tailored services.\n\nIt\u2019s a chance for Goldman to show more clients that the firm known for a willingness to lock up some of its own cash when spotting an opportunity will now do it with others\u2019 money \u2014 akin to a Blackstone Inc.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not had as much time with some of these investors as some other alternative players have,\u201d Nachmann said. \u201cYou are asking people to trust you that I\u2019m going to spend the next three to five years investing your money. It\u2019s a very long-term commitment and getting that trust takes some time.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2018Unnatural Partnerships\u2019\n\nBut compared with many other banks, Goldman is a veteran in the niche of private credit. Its current target is to more than double those assets to $300 billion within the next five years. Investors shouldn\u2019t assume that newer entrants will have the same expertise when tackling such a complex market, said Greg Olafson, the head of Goldman\u2019s private-credit business.\n\n\u201cThis is like a high-touch business, it\u2019s high-touch on origination, it\u2019s high-touch if anything happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the teams nor the experience. And so what are they gonna do?\u201d\n\nOne nascent trend among banks has been to pair up with money managers. \u201cThere are unnatural partnerships being formed,\u201d Olafson said.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to emulate what we have over a 30-year period,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll find that challenging.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. has earmarked more than $10 billion of the firm\u2019s balance sheet for direct lending and is trying to put together a partnership with asset managers to join it in private credit deals. Meanwhile, its asset-management unit is on the hunt to acquire a firm that operates in the space.\n\nOthers, such as Wells Fargo & Co. and Barclays Plc, have also formed tie-ups hoping to originate deals that their partners can take on.\n\nUltra Wealthy\n\nBeyond institutional investors, Goldman also found willing buyers in third-party wealth channels, as well as among the ultra-wealthy it already serves, with an average account size of about $70 million.\n\nThese high-net worth individuals are in a way \u201cacting, from an asset-allocation perspective, very similar to some of the institutions,\u201d Nachmann said. \u201cThey\u2019ve continued to increase allocation to alternatives.\u201d\n\nUltimately, outcomes among money managers will diverge, as borrowers that long enjoyed low interest rates confront the burden of higher borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cThe last 10 years have been a very benign environment, you didn\u2019t see much dispersion in people\u2019s returns on credit because everything kind of worked,\u201d Nachmann said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more interesting going forward.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Elon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley Why Dave & Buster\u2019s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos When Business Is Just a Game The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jamie Dimon's retirement talk puts new spotlight on key JPMorgan deputies",
        "content": "Jamie Dimon made it clear last week that he sees an end to his time as boss of the biggest US bank, putting a new spotlight on key deputies who are considered front runners for his job.\n\nThe disclosure came during JPMorgan Chase\u2019s (JPM) annual investor day in Manhattan, where analysts and bank followers gathered to hear about plans for the next year.\n\nDimon said his timetable for an exit is \"not five years anymore,\" and that the succession process is \"well on the way.\"\n\n\"There's more line of sight that in the next three or four years Jamie Dimon likely becomes chairman and somebody else becomes CEO of JPMorgan,\" said Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo, who asked Dimon for a succession update during the investor day event. Jamie Dimon during the ceremony for placement of the final beam for JPMorgan Chase's new global headquarters building in New York City last November. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe CEO's comments re-focused attention on executives who have the best shot at Dimon\u2019s job, all of whom gave presentations about their business lines. Some are in new roles following a management reshuffling in January designed to give candidates a wider range of responsibilities.\n\nTwo names keep surfacing inside and outside the bank: Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak, who each have a hand in overseeing the two biggest parts of the company.\n\nIt's \"a two woman race,\" Mayo said.\n\nFrom the outside, Mayo added, \u201cit seems like a coin flip between the two, making the next few years very important. Will both sides of the company perform well? Will there be an incident?\u201d Marianne Lake, CEO of JPMorgan Chase's consumer and community bank (JOE VERICKER PHOTOBUREAU INC)\n\nThe two executives share much in the way of credentials. Both have acted as JPMorgan's chief financial officer, both are in their mid-50s and both have been with the bank longer than Dimon, who joined in 2004.\n\nUntil January they were also both in charge of JPMorgan\u2019s sprawling consumer and small business unit, which churns out the highest returns for the bank and oversees everything from checking accounts to credit cards to home loans.\n\nThen Piepszak, as part of the management shake-up, became co-CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s commercial and investment bank, which acts as a major player on Wall Street. Lake became the sole boss of the consumer division. Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s commercial and investment bank. (JOE VERICKER PHOTOBUREAU INC)\n\nAnalysts are in near-lockstep agreement of the difficulty JPMorgan\u2019s board will face in trying to fill Dimon\u2019s shoes.\n\nThe 68-year old is the longest-serving big bank CEO and the only one left who called the shots during the 2008 financial crisis. Since he took over in 2006, JPMorgan\u2019s stock price has risen to roughly eight times its initial value.\n\nThe \"handoff will be tricky no matter what,\" Ebrahim Poonawala, a Bank of America Securities analyst, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bank already has a plan if the sudden and unforeseen happens to Dimon, a contingency referred to by insiders and even Dimon himself as the \"hit by a bus\" scenario.\n\nIn that case, the job will go to chief operating officer Daniel Pinto.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got built in succession with Daniel Pinto. How many companies can say that?\" Dimon said last week. Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's chief operating officer. (JPMorgan Chase)\n\nPinto's career with the bank stretches back to 1983, when he began working in Buenos Aires as a financial analyst and foreign exchange trader for a predecessor company called Manufacturers Hanover.\n\nIn 2020, the Argentine executive had his chance to step in when Dimon was struck with a sudden and near-fatal heart injury.\n\nPinto served as co-CEO for a month along with Gordon Smith, another executive who at one time was also considered a \"hit by a bus\" replacement for Dimon. Smith retired in 2021.\n\nBut even if this scenario were to take place again, Pinto wouldn't be expected to remain CEO over the long term.\n\nAlthough Lake and Piepszak are considered frontrunners for the permanent CEO job, the dynamics of the race can always change.\n\nThere are some other relatively young executives who have been elevated into new roles recently, including Piepszak\u2019s co-head of the commercial and investment bank, Troy Rohrbaugh.\n\nA newer face to outsiders, Rohrbaugh has spent nearly two decades with JPMorgan. He came up through the bank\u2019s fixed income trading business after previously working for Goldman Sachs (GS).\n\nAnother \"long shot\" possibility that the board may consider is bringing in someone outside of JPMorgan, according to Mayo, especially if JPMorgan continues to place more focus on developing artificial intelligence and other new technology.\n\nEven with Dimon out of the CEO role, he probably won't be gone from the bank entirely. He could remain as chair of the board.\n\nThe bank has previously indicated that its next CEO will not hold the dual role of board chair, a split that is receiving increasing amount of support from shareholders.\n\nLast week, nearly 43% of JPMorgan stockholders voted in favor of such an arrangement, up from 37.5% in 2023.\n\n\"Will I stay as chairman for a while?\u201d Dimon said last week, at investor day. \u201cWe'll see.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The stock market is showing signs of a comeback with their all-time highs. This is coupled with the market betting on the Fed, which isn\u2019t expected to increase interest rates further.\u00a0While we cannot predict how high the bull market will go, we can look to the market leaders for overall return. So, let\u2019s look at the top performers from the Dow Jones Industrial Average for stocks to buy during this bull market.\n\nTo get the list, I screened for the following criteria:\n\nTop YTD price percent change, YOY revenue growth should be at least 10%, YOY earnings growth is a minimum of 10%.\n\nThis lets me focus on the companies already performing well in terms of price percentage return and with positive financials that justify their growth. I then arranged the top three from the highest YTD price change to the lowest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Express Company (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmex, which is short for American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), is a globally integrated payments company that offers customers various credit cards to different businesses, corporations, and consumers. American Express has four main operational segments.\n\nUnited States Consumer Services: handles AMEX travel and lifestyle services, including banking and non-card products. Commercial Services: payment and expense management, banking, and non-card financing products. International Card Services: offers travel and lifestyle services to international clients and manages international joint ventures with other businesses. Global Merchant and Network Services:\u00a0provides marketing and data analytics.\n\nAMEX\u2019s strong brand recognition makes it one of the largest credit card issuers in the world. Its global footprint follows other card providers like Visa, Mastercard, and UnionPay.\n\nAmerican Express reported excellent financials in 2023. Billed business and total revenue grew 9% and 14% YOY, respectively. Net income also saw 11% growth, while diluted EPS increased by 14%. As a result of this top-tier performance, the company announced a 17% increase in quarterly dividends for 2024.\n\n\u201cWe delivered record revenues and profits in 2023, building on the momentum we\u2019ve achieved since we announced our growth plan in January 2022,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Stephen J. Squeri.\n\nThe company expects similar growth in 2024, with revenue anticipated to increase by 9% to 11%. This excellent performance is shown in price action.\n\nAs we speak, AXP stock is up 28% YTD. Who knows how high it will get from here?\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe next on the list is part of the magnificent seven stocks that pushed the S&P 500 to all time highs. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a tech behemoth with humble beginnings.\n\nFrom an online marketplace for books to an identity synonymous with online shopping, its ventures are continuously developing, with its latest ventures focusing on AI, cloud computing, digital streaming, and quantum computing. With the strong demand for cloud and the growth of generative AI, Amazon stands at the frontline in the race for the top dog in the tech sector.\n\nAmazon reported 12% YOY higher revenue in 2023. This good news came with another significant increase in operating income, from $12.2 billion to $36.9 billion. Each segment contributed to this growth, with all four (North America, International, AWS, and Consolidated) seeing double-digit increases.\n\nThe company\u2019s profit turnaround is even more exciting, recovering from a $2.7 billion loss in 2022 to a $30.4 billion net income in 2023.\n\n\u201cThis Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,\u201d said CEO Andy Jassy.\n\nAmazon\u2019s relentless pursuit of growing its business across different industries continues to pay off \u2013 so it\u2019s no wonder AMZN stock is up 22% YTD. All this makes Amazon a likely contender if you\u2019re looking for stocks to buy during a bull market.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills.

        "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has analyzed NTPC\u2019s fourth-quarter performance for FY24, noting an adjusted consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 53 billion, slightly below the estimated INR 55 billion. This shortfall was due to higher-than-expected fixed cost under-recovery from operational issues at the Barh and Barauni power plants.\n\nNTPC\u2019s renewable energy portfolio has expanded to 23.2 GW at various development stages. The management plans to monetize this growth through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) by October-November 2024. Post-monetization, NTPC (NS:NTPC) will continue to support the renewable segment's growth if needed. The completion of these renewable projects is expected by FY27.\n\nOffer: You can get InvestingPro at a steep discount of up to 69%, for INR 216/month, for a very limited time. Investors are already taking advantage of such a mouth-watering price to ramp up their investing game. In case you are finally ready to up your investing journey, Click here before time runs out.\n\nNTPC's new coal project pipeline stands at 15.2 GW, with over 10 GW expected to be ordered in FY25. Additionally, NTPC is entering the nuclear energy sector, planning to order the 2.8 GW Mahi Banswara nuclear power plant in partnership with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India within the current fiscal year. This move into nuclear energy is expected to ensure long-term growth stability for NTPC's core business after the renewable business monetization.\n\nGoldman Sachs maintains a 'Buy' rating for NTPC, despite a recent share price rally. Analysts foresee the coal capacity pipeline growing by an additional 12 GW, enhancing the value from renewable business monetization. NTPC's stock is trading at a forward price-to-book value (P/BV) of 1.9x, which, despite being above its historical median, is still significantly lower than the 3.4-3.6x multiples of private sector peers like Tata Power (NS:TTPW) and JSW Energy (NS:JSWE).\n\nNTPC\u2019s strategic positioning in both thermal and renewable energy sectors is highlighted, with a stable regulated business model offering a 3% dividend yield, adding a margin of safety for investors. Goldman Sachs has adjusted its forecasts based on FY24 numbers, predicting a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings for FY24-27, driven by a 7% CAGR in regulated equity, a 37% CAGR in joint venture profits, and early contributions from the renewable energy business.\n\nImage Source: InvestingPro+\n\nGoldman Sachs values NTPC at a target price of INR 395 per share, implying a FY26 estimated P/BV of 2x and an FY26 estimated enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple of 12x for the renewable business, reflecting high growth potential and strategic options. Key risks include potential delays in new coal plant executions, aggressive renewable energy bidding, adverse movements in module prices or debt costs, and unfavorable regulatory changes.\n\nStory continues\n\nImage Source: InvestingPro+\n\nEven with InvestingPro\u2019s financial models, the intrinsic value of INR 395 is an extreme end, the highest among 14 models. For a more realistic approach, the fair value is considered as the accurate metric for valuation as it takes a mean of all values which helps avoid extreme valuations. In this case, the fair value is 325, depicting a 12% downside potential from the MCP of INR 370.\n\nAnother thing to note is the stock has already run up 116% in the last one year, therefore waiting for the prices to cool down before going on the stock might be a better strategy.\n\nClick here Subscribe to InvestingPro now at a discount of up to 69%, for just INR 216/month and unlock the full potential of your investments.\n\nAlso Read: Unveiling the Power of Fair Value with InvestingPro+\n\nX (formerly, Twitter) - Aayush Khanna\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNTPC's Q4 Performance and Strategic Developments: Goldman Sachs Analysis\n\nWhy these analysts say it's \"hard to get too bearish\" on the S&P 500\n\nModi's return will power India's defence, infra stocks, Motilal Oswal's Agrawal says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Is Moelis (MC) Up 12.7% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Moelis (MC). Shares have added about 12.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Moelis due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nMoelis & Company's Q1 Earnings Top as Revenues Rise Y/Y\n\nMoelis & Company\u2019s first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of 22 cents handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents. The bottom line compared favorably with 5 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nResults benefited from a rise in revenues and other income. Also, the company had a solid liquidity position in the quarter. However, an increase in expenses acted as an undermining factor.\r\n\r\nNet income (GAAP basis) was $17.5 million, up substantially from $3.6 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nRevenues Rise, Expenses Up\n\nTotal revenues (GAAP basis) grew 15% year over year to $217.5 million. This was driven by a rise in fees earned from restructuring and capital markets transactions. The top line, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $222.7 million.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses (GAAP basis) were $211.7 million, up 12%. The rise was due to an increase in both compensation and benefits costs and non-compensation expenses. Our estimates for total operating expenses were $223.8 million.\r\n\r\nOther income (GAAP basis) was $4.2 million in the reported quarter, surging from $1.7 million in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, the company had cash and liquid investments of $124.9 million, with no debt or goodwill.\n\nOutlook\n\nManagement expects adjusted non-compensation expenses to be almost $46 million per quarter.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -42.55% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Moelis has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Moelis has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nMoelis belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Another stock from the same industry, Goldman Sachs (GS), has gained 9.1% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $8.87 per share, indicating a change of +188% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Goldman. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of F.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Should Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
        "content": "Looking for broad exposure to the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 06/28/2017.\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $484.12 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Small Cap Blend\n\nSmall cap companies have market capitalization below $2 billion. They usually have higher potential than large and mid cap companies with stocks but higher risk.\n\nBlend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.\n\nCosts\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.35%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 20.10% of the portfolio. Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) accounts for about 1.81% of total assets, followed by Jun 24 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYM24) and Comfort Systems Usa Inc (FIX).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 6.02% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nGSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nThe ETF has added roughly 1.23% so far this year and is up about 17.85% in the last one year (as of 05/24/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $51.83 and $65.55.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 21% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1297 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSSC is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 ETF has $60 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF has $78.14 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nPassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC) was launched on 09/17/2015, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $11.99 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.\n\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\n\nCosts\n\nCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.27%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.80% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 6.12% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 27.37% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nGSLC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of large-capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nThe ETF return is roughly 10.76% so far this year and it's up approximately 28.33% in the last one year (as of 05/24/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $80.97 and $104.64.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 16.96% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 442 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSLC is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $460.47 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $527.49 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Inside the 25-year relationship between Goldman Sachs and Juniper Networks\u2014and its bittersweet end",
        "content": "Relationships mean everything on Wall Street, and perhaps nowhere has this been more obvious than Goldman Sachs\u2019s quarter-century-long journey with Juniper Networks.\n\nIn January, Juniper, once one of the hottest startups and which helped revolutionize the networking space, agreed to sell itself to Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $14 billion. Juniper CEO Rami Rahim, who started with the company about 28 years ago, will lead the new HPE networking business and report to Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s president and CEO. It\u2019s unclear how many of Juniper\u2019s 11,000 employees are joining HPE or whether Juniper will keep its name. HPE, according to a spokeswoman, will evaluate team structures and needs throughout the integration process and decide on branding after the deal closes.\n\nThe deal is a bittersweet ending for Goldman, which has advised Juniper for 25 years, including its sale to HPE. \u201cIt\u2019s like birth and death,\u201d one Goldman exec told Fortune. \u201cThe IPO and the sale are bookends of the company\u2019s life. On one hand, the deal is very innovative and high profile. On other hand, the company Juniper goes away.\u201d\n\nGoldman has advised some of the biggest companies\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia among them\u2014but with Juniper, the storied investment bank was there at the very beginning, in 1999, with the dot.com boom in high gear. Investors were pouring millions of dollars into unprofitable web startups, many of which went public and saw their stock prices double\u2014or even triple\u2014in their debuts.\n\nPradeep Sindhu, a pioneering computer scientist, in 1996 cofounded Juniper, which made the Internet routers that were used by some of the biggest service providers of that time, including UUNet, an MCI WorldCom company; Cable & Wireless USA; and AT&T. Juniper raised millions from some of the biggest venture firms of the late 1990s, like Kleiner Perkins and New Enterprise Associates, meanwhile Goldman was a top IPO banker, having served as the lead underwriter on some of that era\u2019s biggest IPOs, including Yahoo, Red Hat, and Expedia.\n\nTo win the mandate for the Juniper IPO, Goldman had to compete against several other firms, including Credit Suisse, or CSFB, the top underwriter of new issues from 1999 to 2000, Fortune has reported.\u00a0 About a dozen Goldman bankers, including a number of partners, worked on the team that pursued Juniper, said the executive, who added: \u201cIt was a massive gang tackle.\u201d\n\nFirst, Goldman had to solve a big problem: Juniper didn\u2019t want its shares to rise during the IPO and then have them plunge once insiders began off-loading them when the 180-day lock-up expired. Goldman came up with the \u201cstaggered lockup,\u201d an innovation that allows insiders to sell a percentage of their shares in phases, avoiding the volatility often seen when large blocks are sold all at once.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cStaggered lockups have become more common over time. Back then, 180 days for everybody was pretty standard,\u201d said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida\u2019s Warrington College of Business, who pointed to Google\u2019s 2004 IPO.\n\nThe lockup innovation helped Goldman win over Juniper and become lead underwriter, the most coveted position a bank can hold in an IPO. In June 1999, Juniper became a dot.com darling when its stock soared 190% from its $34 offer price on its debut. (The Juniper IPO occurred one month after Goldman went public.)\n\n'A crazy time'\n\nJuniper certainly was \u201ca hot IPO\u201d in 1999, but it ended up ranking just 53rd out of 486 that year, noted Matt Kennedy, senior IPO strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research that manages two IPO-focused ETFs. \u201cI think that tells you how much of a crazy time the Internet bubble was.\u201d\n\nOf the 17 banks listed in Juniper\u2019s S-1 regulatory filing, roughly seven still exist. Since then, Goldman has remained in constant dialogue with Juniper, cementing its status as one of the company\u2019s most trusted advisors. Over 100 people, including some of the biggest names at Goldman, have worked on deals for Juniper, including: Stephen Pierce, currently chairman of global equity capital markets; Cindy Panchula, chief of staff for global TMT banking; Ryan Limaye, co-head of global technology investment banking; Pawan Tewari, co-head of technology M&A; John Waldron, president and COO; and Dan Dees, co-head of global banking and markets. (Dees led a $1.4 billion block trade of Juniper stock that was owned by Ericsson in 2000.)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Juniper wanted to expand into the edge router market and was in negotiations to buy an unnamed company, but due diligence revealed some concerns. Juniper decided not to do the deal, the Goldman executive told Fortune. Instead, Goldman advised Juniper to target Unisphere Networks, which was rumored to be considering an IPO. Juniper acquired Unisphere in 2002, expanding its niche in edge routers. (Jim Dolce, Unisphere\u2019s CEO, has served on Juniper\u2019s board since 2015.) In 2004, Goldman advised Juniper when it scooped up Netscreen Technologies for $4 billion. Netscreen, a leader in firewalls, was part of Juniper\u2019s effort to increase its security capabilities.\n\nJuniper had to fend off activist investors buying up shares in 2013, and Goldman was there, too. The bank contacted Robyn Denholm, then Juniper\u2019s CFO, and warned that \u201csomething might be coming,\u201d the person said. Denholm, who\u2019s now chairman of Tesla\u2019s board, agreed that Juniper needed to prepare itself. It turned out that Elliot Management had built up a sizable position, 6.2%, and wanted to make changes at Juniper, including a stock buyback and cost reductions of $200 million.\n\n\u201cElliot was pushing them to break the company up, which didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d the person said. Juniper negotiated a settlement with Elliot in February 2014 in which it agreed to add directors, cut $160 million in costs, and commit to a $3 billion capital return. The next year, Juniper added two more directors that Elliot supported. \u201cIt was a two-year dialogue with Elliot over their demands,\u201d the person said.\n\nGoldman has advised four different Juniper CEOs. Sometimes the leaders don\u2019t have a relationship with the bank, or may be loyal to another bank, but Goldman has remained a key advisor. The secret to a long, durable relationship is to put the client\u2019s interest first, the exec told Fortune. \u201cIf you do that with regularity, and sufficiently, they will feel that you are a trusted advisor. Hopefully, they will select you when they need someone.\u201d\n\nIt was fitting that Goldman was on stage for Juniper\u2019s last act. The networking space has slowed considerably since the late 1990s, while software, the internet, and AI have skyrocketed. Juniper has posted modest sales growth for many years, although its stock price never again reached its dot.com boom highs.\n\nStill, it was HPE that first approached Rahim, Juniper\u2019s CEO, about a potential transaction in February 2023, initially offering $37.75 a share\u2014a figure that rose to $40 after months of negotiations, according to a Feb. 7 proxy filing. Ultimately, it was an offer Juniper couldn\u2019t turn down. \u201cCompanies often don\u2019t choose to sell,\u201d the exec said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Some Fed officials willing to raise rates if needed: meeting minutes",
        "content": "Federal Reserve officials said at their last policy meeting that rates would likely stay higher for longer if inflation readings continued to disappoint, while some policymakers discussed their willingness to raise rates if needed.\n\n\"Various participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate,\u201d according to the minutes of the last meeting, which took place April 30 and May 1.\n\nStocks slipped from record highs after the minutes were released.\n\n\"Higher for longer is the official mantra as the Fed officially acknowledged that inflation is staying more sticky than they would have liked,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\n\"Although they wanted to cut rates, they are not going to be able to do that in the near future.\"\n\nThe Fed decided on May 1 to keep its benchmark interest rate in a range of 5.25%-5.50%, a 23-year high, as it tries to get inflation down to its goal of 2%.\n\nThe inflation readings in the first quarter were hotter than expected, but an April reading released after the Fed's last meeting did show some easing of those price pressures.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index on a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, rose 3.6% year over year, a cooling from the 3.8% increase seen in March.\n\nFed officials at their last meeting cited the disappointing readings on inflation over the first quarter and indicators pointing to strong economic momentum as reasons why they believe they\u2019ll have to hold rates higher for longer.\n\nA few thought that \"unusually large seasonal patterns\" could have contributed to January\u2019s large increase in inflation, while several noted that some components that typically display volatile price changes had boosted recent readings.\n\nBut some emphasized that the recent increases in inflation had been relatively broad based and shouldn\u2019t be discounted.\n\nThere was also a discussion about the restrictiveness of the current level of interest rates.\n\nMany acknowledged uncertainty about how restrictive rates actually are, noting that high rates may be having less of an impact than in past cycles or that longer-run rates that neither boost or slow economic growth may be higher than thought.\n\n\"A number of participants noted uncertainty regarding the degree of restrictiveness of current financial conditions and the associated risk that such conditions were insufficiently restrictive on aggregate demand and inflation,\" the minutes said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe minutes, which are released with a three-week lag, come after a slew of Fed officials have publicly called for holding rates at current levels for longer due to the sticky inflation data in the first quarter.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Susan Collins both said Tuesday night they need to see more evidence inflation is cooling before lowering rates. Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington on May 1. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCollins said the Fed will need to be patient and that getting inflation down will take longer than she previously thought. Mester said she wants to see \"a few more months\" of data that show inflation is coming down before cutting rates.\n\nSeparately Tuesday, Fed Governor Chris Waller said he favors holding interest rates steady for longer and needs to see several more months of good inflation data before lowering rates.\n\nThese comments come after Fed Chair Jay Powell said last week he thinks the Fed will need more than a quarter's worth of data to really make a judgment on whether inflation is steadily falling toward 2%. Waller appears to want more, noting he would like to see \u201cseveral\u201d months of data.\n\nThat implies it will take more than three inflation reports for the Fed to feel confident about lowering rates from a 23-year high, putting the odds on a first rate cut in September at the earliest if the data supports such a move.\n\nInvestors are pricing in roughly 50% odds for a September rate cut, with dwindling odds for a second rate cut after that.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said at an event Wednesday that he doesn't expect the fed to raise rates at all this year.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Suzanne McGee\n\nBOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said on Wednesday he does not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.\n\n\"I'm still at zero cuts,\" Solomon said at a Boston College event. \"I think we're set up for stickier inflation.\"\n\nHis comments came after Federal Reserve policymakers said on Tuesday the U.S. central bank should wait several more months to ensure that inflation really is back on track to its 2% target before cutting interest rates.\n\nSolomon's comments stand in contrast to market expectations for at least one rate cut by the Fed this year. Traders reduced bets on Wednesday for more than one rate cut this year, after the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's April 30-May 1 policy meeting showed rate-setters thought inflation could take longer to ease than previously thought.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSolomon told an audience of about 150 senior corporate executives and Boston College students that while he believes the U.S. economy is fundamentally quite strong, not all Americans are experiencing growth or the impact of inflation the same way.\n\n\"Inflation is not just nominal, it's cumulative,\" Solomon said, citing a conversation he had recently with the CEO of a grocery chain who has seen customers cutting back on the size of purchases in response to rising prices.\n\n\"We're starting to see the average American slowing down and changing his habits,\" Solomon added.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO also said he does expect to see interest rate cuts in Europe this year, as the region struggles with \"a more sluggish economy.\"\n\nHe voiced concern about a number of headwinds to global growth, ranging from inflationary pressures to geopolitical concerns.\n\n\"The geopolitical fragility is something we're going to have to live with for a time,\" Solomon said.\n\nSolomon also called for a broader approach to industrial policy within the United States.\n\n\"We are probably heading toward multiple increases in demand for power without thinking about how we're going to generate that power,\" he said, pointing to the need to build out a support network for re-charging electric vehicles and the increased burden that adopting AI technologies will have on the existing grid.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee in Boston and Saeed Azhar in New York; editing by Lananh Nguyen and Leslie Adler)",

The unit\u2019s stock traded at about 4.13 dirhams each in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, valuing the shares on offer at about 3.3 billion dirhams ($898 million).\n\nAdnoc is capitalizing on a rally in the drilling unit\u2019s shares, which have increased about 80% since their listing in October 2021. The stock is up 8% this year and hit an all-time high earlier this month. The emirate\u2019s benchmark index, though, has under-performed most regional benchmarks.\n\nSecondary share sales have been rare in the Middle East in recent years. But the region has been a bright spot for IPOs, with Saudi Arabia seeing a burst of activity in the last few weeks. Several of the sales have drawn many times more orders from investors than there are shares available. Dubai has hosted two initial share sales this year, and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Alef Education is set to go public, marking the emirate\u2019s first listing of the year.\n\nAdnoc owns about 84% in Adnoc Drilling.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Goldman (GS) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Goldman Sachs (GS).\n\nGoldman currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.48, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.48 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 73.9% and 4.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GS Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GS\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Goldman here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Goldman, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs GS Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Goldman, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.3% over the past month to $36.57.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Goldman. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Goldman may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "After reporting impressive results in Q1 customer growth, profitability, and a return on equity surpassing the country\u2019s top three incumbent banks, the Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) alleviated one of the market\u2019s main concerns: its potentially stretched valuation. Thus, I am bullish on NU stock.\n\nNu Holdings emerged as an alternative to traditional banks\u2019 credit cards. Its objective is to utilize technology to minimize bureaucracy and streamline access to credit and other banking services for the average Latin American consumer through an intuitive interface.\n\nTo highlight the extent of Nu Holdings\u2019 customer base, the company has reached 99.3 million customers, with 92 million of them concentrated in Brazil alone, representing 54% of the adult population of Brazil. Furthermore, Nu has rapidly expanded into other Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Colombia.\n\nThe investment thesis for Nu Holdings is straightforward. The company holds a leading position in Latin America and is a profitable fintech company. There are still numerous cross-selling opportunities available through the Nubank app, and significant potential remains for expansion into other Latin American countries, notably Mexico. Additionally, there is considerable opportunity in Brazil with consigned credit and corporate accounts.\n\nAs Nu Holdings unifies quality and growth in a cyclical and mature industry in several developed countries, its stock is far from a bargain at first glance. The company trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of ~45x and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 8.2x, which appear to be stretched multiples.\n\nEven so, with the Brazilian fintech company delivering increasingly impressive numbers each quarter and considering future growth prospects against the current price, I believe there is room to adopt a bullish stance.\n\nNu Holdings\u2019 Growth Formula\n\nNu Holdings continues its rapid and substantial growth trajectory, driven by a formula that combines active customers multiplied by average revenue per active user (ARPAC), subtracted by the cost to serve, resulting in significant earnings power. This is highlighted in the company\u2019s investor presentation, as you can see below.\n\nTo illustrate Nu Holdings\u2019 strategy, let\u2019s delve into some key operational data highlighting the firm\u2019s effective operational execution:\n\nActive Customers: Nu Holdings boasts a rapidly expanding customer base with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%. This growth is particularly notable in early-stage penetration markets such as Mexico and Colombia. Increasing Revenue per Customer: Nu Holdings\u2019 average revenue per active customer (ARPAC) has increased by 30% year-over-year, indicating robust monetization. This growth is particularly noteworthy, given that 1 in every 2.5 Brazilians holds an account with Nu Holdings\u2019 Nubank. Low-Cost Operating Platform: Leveraging its entirely digital banking model, Nu Holdings maintains a remarkably low cost per customer, averaging 90 cents. This cost efficiency enables Nu Holdings to scale its platform rapidly and more efficiently than traditional banks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBusiness Model Continues with Strong Operating Leverage\n\nNu Holdings has been posting increasingly robust numbers at virtually every operational and financial level each quarter, gradually addressing investor growth and quality concerns.\n\nThe most\u00a0recent results (Q1 2024) showed strong growth in its financial metrics. Net income increased 167% from $141.8 million recorded in the same period last\u00a0year. Adjusted net income for the quarter amounted to\u00a0$442.7 million, compared to adjusted net income of $182.4 million in the first three months of 2023.\n\nMore surprising was the quarter\u2019s annualized return on equity (ROE) of 23%, positioning the digital bank not only on par with but superior to its traditional peers, such as Ita\u00fa Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB) and Banco do Brasil (OTC:BDORY), both of which have ROEs of 21%.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s CEO, David V\u00e9lez, these figures were achieved due to the fintech\u2019s business model, which is driven by revenue expansion and a stable cost per client.\n\nThe financial services platform\u2019s revenue rose 64% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis to $2.7 billion from January to March. The average monthly cost of service per active customer in the quarter remained stable at 90 cents, demonstrating the strong operating leverage of Nu Holdings\u2019 business model.\n\nOn this basis, Nu Holdings also increased its loan portfolio in Q1 to $19.6 billion compared to $12.8 billion in the first quarter of last year.\n\nTo complement Nu Holdings\u2019s strong results, the company addressed one of its main risks: delinquency. Non-performing loans (NPL) over 90 days were reported at 6.3%, while those between 15 and 90 days stood at 5%, which aligns with expectations and historical seasonality, according to the company.\n\nStretched Valuation, But Justifiable\n\nWhen it comes to valuation, despite its impressive efficiency and rapid growth, Nu Holdings doesn\u2019t come cheap. Its price-to-book (P/B) ratio, standing at 8.2x, is notably higher than the banking sector average of 1.05x. This ratio is particularly relevant for banks, as it offers insight into how the market values their assets relative to their reported book value.\n\nNonetheless, despite the stock trading at a non-GAAP P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio of 45x, the valuation can be justified. When dividing the P/E ratio by the EPS long-term growth consensus estimate for the next 12 months, Nu Holdings trades\u00a0at a\u00a0PEG (price/earnings to growth) ratio\u00a0of 0.57x (a figure of 1.0x or lower is generally seen as undervalued).\n\nFactoring in accelerated growth estimates, it could be argued that Nu Holdings may be undervalued, given its growth trajectory.\n\nIs NU Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAccording to the\u00a0consensus of analysts who have provided forecasts for the next 12 months, the stock comes in as a Strong Buy, and the average price target for Nu Holdings stock is $13.14 per share. This implies upside potential of 13.8%.\n\nAfter earnings, Tito Labarta, an analyst from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), maintained a positive outlook on Nu Holdings, emphasizing the company\u2019s strong growth and profitability prospects. He reaffirmed a price target of $15 and a Buy rating.\n\nLabarta noted that the recent deterioration in asset quality was mainly seasonal, with provisions in Q1 2024 returning to normal levels after lower provisions in Q4 2023 due to significant recoveries. He highlights that personal loan growth is outpacing credit card growth. The 90bps increase in the early NPL ratio is also seen as a typical seasonal rise.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNu Holdings is a fintech that combines the business fundamentals of a consolidated company with the early stages of growth in Latin American countries such as Mexico and Colombia. It\u2019s no surprise that even Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has taken notice and included it in its portfolio.\n\nThe Q1 results again showed robust operating leverage, with the fintech company expanding its customer base and monetizing them rapidly while maintaining stable delinquency levels and sustaining very low costs per customer.\n\nThis recipe for growth looks very solid. There is also still an opportunity to monetize Brazilian customers with numerous cross-selling opportunities and opportunities in consignated credit and corporate accounts.\n\nAs these developments materialize, the current valuation based on the market\u2019s expectation for Nu, which is no bargain, should make more sense. That said, my outlook on Nu Holdings is bullish. I believe there are still great growth opportunities that the market has yet to price.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS plans to ramp up its lending services to private equity and asset managers, per Reuters. The bank also intends to expand internationally, filling the gaps created by the problems at regional banks and the recent sale of Credit Suisse.\r\n\r\nThe private equity market has a strong potential to grow as private equity deals are expected to rise, driven by record-high fundraising. These loans are classified as short-term, typically secured by the assets of the borrowing firms and hence have a lesser risk attached to them. Hence, GS\u2019 focus on the private equity market is a strategic fit.\r\n\r\nAsset-secured lending will allow GS to expand its financing business in fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) and equities space. The move is in line with the company\u2019s key focus on enhancing the stability of revenue generation in its global banking and markets divisions.\r\n\r\nIn the past to seven years, Goldman's deposit base experienced tremendous growth. The bank is actively seeking to align its asset growth with this expansion.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, GS took over a loan portfolio worth $15 billion from the failed Signature bank. This portfolio included loans to private equity firms and venture capital funds, which is a crucial part of its client base. These loans help manage a smooth flow of working capital for the bank, also known as capital call facilities or subscription line loans.\r\n \r\nOnce Goldman strengthened its operations in the United States, the bank plans to expand its lending into Europe, the U.K. and Asia. They have already added staff in its Dallas and Bangalore offices to handle these loans.\r\n\r\nMarkedly, Goldman decided to refocus on its core strengths of IB and trading operations while scaling back its consumer banking footprint and hence undertook a major business restructuring initiative. In first-quarter 2024, the company completed the sale of GreenSky, its home-improvement lending platform, to a consortium of investors. In second-half 2023, it sold its Personal Financial Management unit to Creative Planning. These are in line with its decision to focus on and grow core businesses where it showcased encouraging results given its strong leadership position, wide scale of operations and exceptional talent.\r\nIn the past six months, the company\u2019s shares have rallied 39.6% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 35.8%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nApart from GS, major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC are also increasing their participation in the market worth $800 billion to $1 trillion. Also, JPM stepped up its lending functions after it acquired First Republic Bank in 2023. Similarly, in October 2023, PNC acquired loan commitments from Signature Bank worth approximately $16 billion. These efforts to further grow its loan balances are expected to offer support to the banks\u2019 financials in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Goldman Sachs Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Goldman Sachs (GS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to GS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nGoldman Sachs' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Goldman Sachs' main business drivers.\n\nFounded in 1869, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. The company is headquartered in New York, with offices in major financial centers globally.\r\n\r\nGoldman provides its services through the following broad segments:\r\n\r\nThe Global Banking and Markets segment (constitutes 64.9% of net revenues in 2023) generates revenues from IB fees, including advisory, and equity and debt underwriting fees, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) intermediation and financing activities and Equities intermediation and financing activities. The segment also includes relationship lending and acquisition financing (and related hedges) and investing activities related to its Global Banking & Markets activities.\r\n\r\nThe Asset and Wealth Management segment (30%) generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, equity investments and debt investments, as well as private banking and lending.\r\n\r\nThe Platform Solutions segment (5.1%) generates revenues from consumer platforms, and transaction banking and other platform businesses.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, Goldman completed the divestiture of its Personal Financial Management unit to Creative Planning, resulting in a gain of $349 million.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the company acquired robo-advisor, NextCapital and Dutch asset manager, NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V. The company also closed the acquisition of GreenSky in an all-stock transaction. In 2020 and 2019, Goldman completed its purchase of Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Goldman Sachs, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $2,989.96, or a gain of 199%, as of May 20, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 182.41% and gold's return of 79.53% over the same time frame.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for GS too.\n\nShares of Goldman have outperformed the industry in the past six months. Its better-than-expected first-quarter 2024 results benefited from the strength in the consumer banking and investment banking (IB) businesses, along with improved fee income. The company intends to refocus on the core strengths of IB and trading businesses. Improvement in global deal-making and underwriting activities and Goldman\u2019s leading position are likely to drive IB fees. We expect IB revenues to grow 17.8% year over year in 2024. However, subdued capital market activity and uncertainty in client volumes are worrisome. A rise in expenses will impede its bottom line. We expect non-interest expenses to rise 1% in 2024. Amid geopolitical concerns, high dependence on overseas revenues is a woe. Nonetheless, decent liquidity aids sustainable capital distributions.\n\nThe stock is up 15.77% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 9 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Japan\u2019s Benchmark Bond Yield Hits Decade-High on Rate-Hike Bets",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Japan\u2019s benchmark government bond yield climbed to the highest since 2013 on bets the central bank will further raise interest rates to support the struggling yen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site Ebrahim Raisi, Iranian President Confronting West, Dies at 63 Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge China\u2019s Housing Rescue Too Small to End Crisis, Analysts Say Saudi Crown Prince Postpones Japan Trip Over King\u2019s Health\n\nThe yield on 10-year government debt rose 2.5 basis points to 0.975% on Monday, a level last seen when the then newly appointed Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda was starting his radical monetary easing.\n\nNow under his successor Kazuo Ueda, the yield is edging toward the closely watched 1% mark, as BOJ officials signal they\u2019re ready to push up borrowing costs if workers get higher wages that lessen the burden of inflation. That\u2019s far cry from the deeply negative yields seen as recently as 2020, when falling prices weighed on corporate earnings and prompted consumers to put off purchases in hopes that things would get cheaper.\n\nYields on debt due in 20 years to 30 years have also climbed to decade highs, raising expectations that Japanese long-term investors will put more of their funds into domestic debt rather than markets in the US and Europe.\n\n\u201cThe 10-year yield has risen gradually on the back of view that the BOJ will lift interest rates sooner and cut bond-purchase amounts at its operations,\u201d said Naoya Hasegawa, chief bond strategist at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. There may be a little more buying interest for this maturity around the 1% level but selling pressure at the long end of the yield curve is set to continue, according to Hasegawa.\n\nInvestors are scouring data and policymaker statements to try to predict the BOJ\u2019s next move. Pacific Investment Management Co. sees the prospect of three more moves this year. Vanguard Group Inc.\u2019s head of international rates Ales Koutny expects hikes to around 0.75% by the end of the year.\n\nIn contrast to the views of Pimco and Vanguard, AllianceBernstein Holding LP said last week that the BOJ is likely to favor reducing its vast balance sheet over increasing interest rates.\n\nThis matters for the currency market because the huge gap in yields between Japan and the rest of the world has driven the yen to a 34-year low against the dollar. Even after Japan\u2019s 10-year yield has risen, its US counterpart is still about 3.4 percentage points higher, though it\u2019s come down from more than 4.1 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe yen was down 0.1% versus the dollar at 155.74 as of 3:32 p.m. in Tokyo.\n\nUeda told Prime Minister Fumio Kishida earlier this month that he\u2019s watching the yen\u2019s the impact on prices. He\u2019s said in parliament that \u201ca monetary policy response might be needed.\u201d\n\nSee also: Western Asset Betting BOJ Policy Shift to Boost Ultra-Long Bonds\n\n\u201cTouching 1%, or even going above 1% is a matter of time unless US data comes out weak and US rates goes lower with speed,\u201d said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo.\n\nJapan\u2019s inflation has been above the central bank\u2019s target of 2% every month since April 2022. Reflecting this, an auction of 10-year inflation-indexed bonds saw the highest bid-to-cover ratio since August 2007 on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the market for overnight indexed swaps is pricing about a 57% chance that the BOJ will lift rates by July, compared with around 50% odds at the start of May.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists now predict Japan\u2019s 10-year sovereign yield to rise to 2% by the end of 2026 on expectations the central bank will deliver a \u201cprolonged\u201d tightening cycle. They expect the BOJ to raise interest rates to 1.25%-1.50% by 2027, according to a note dated Friday from George Cole and Bill Zu.\n\n\u201cWe think this rise in nominal yields will be led by rising inflation expectations and real rates will be relatively contained,\u201d they wrote. Still, \u201creal rates in Japan are unlikely to fall from current levels given the likelihood of hikes in response to higher inflationary pressure from here.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Matthew Burgess and David Finnerty.\n\n(Adds context in third paragraph, updates prices.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Dow at 40,000: Why stocks still have 'plenty of room to run'",
        "content": "Investors are catching the bull by the horns.\n\nThat\u2019s the sentiment gripping Wall Street, as stocks notch record highs and the market is on track for its best month of the year.\n\nA late surge in the final stretch of trading pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJIA) to close above 40,000 for the first time ever Friday \u2014 a milestone that comes just 874 trading days after the Dow first closed above 30,000.\n\nThe blue-chip index added 1.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both recorded their longest weekly winning streaks since February.\n\n\u201cPsychologically it's amusing,\u201d JPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s Jack Manley said of the milestone on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u2018Morning Brief.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe rally feels good because the macro data has been pretty good,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS), Microsoft (MSFT), and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top three point contributors to the Dow\u2019s charge from 30,000 to 40,000.\n\nAnd the makeup of the Dow looks different than it did during previous milestones. The index most recently replaced Walgreens (WBA) with Amazon (AMZN), bringing it to its current composition.\n\nThis week\u2019s softer inflation print helped bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before year end, as more investors place their bets on a soft-landing.\n\nIn a note to clients this week, Truist co-chief investment strategist Keith Lerner wrote the recent rally is a \u201chealthy sign and typical characteristic of a bull market,\u201d suggesting \u201cupside potential remains.\u201d\n\nAnd Lerner is not alone. Top Wall Street strategists tell Yahoo Finance that the run is far from over, although the ride ahead may be bumpy for investors.\n\n\u201cThe screens are green and the skies are blue \u2026 there's more upside,\u201d BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut that doesn't mean that stocks are going to be linear forever. We are going to see some sort of a normal correction and that's a better buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nBelski warns that a more significant pullback than the 5.5% drawdown earlier this year is likely \u2014 before bouncing back to a higher base. He raised his 2024 year-end forecast to a Street high of 5,600; the S&P 500 closed just above 5,300 this week.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter in particular, especially post-election, will do very well,\u201d Belski added.\n\nA growing list of strategists have raised their S&P year-end targets. As it stands today, more than half of the strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have year-end targets at or above 5,300.\n\nManley sees the market gaining another 5% to 10% from current levels, as long as \u201cthe economy is doing well\u201d and earnings \u201ccatch up.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBig tech names have really been pulling their weight but we need the rest of the index to start playing ball too,\u201d Manley said. \u201cThat\u2019s a back-half story, and I think it helps to lift the market just a bit higher.\u201d\n\nStrong earnings are a key part of the Street\u2019s bullish narrative. As of Friday afternoon, the S&P 500 is on track for earnings growth of 5.7%, the highest earnings growth rate since Q2 2022, according to FactSet. Looking ahead, analysts expect year-over-year earnings growth rates of 9.2% for the current quarter, and 11.1% for fiscal 2024.\n\nNewton Investment Management chief investment officer John Porter told Yahoo Finance he expects the breadth of the earnings improvement to continue beyond big tech, leading to a broadening rally.\n\nOf the 30 best performing stocks on earnings this season, only five came from the tech sector, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment.\n\n\u201cThe resiliency of the market in the face of much more modest rate cut expectations is very impressive,\u201d Porter said of the 2024 rally. \u201cAs long as the market continues to feel the next move from the Fed is a rate cut, I think you've got good support for the broad market.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s up for debate how much higher stocks can go from here, Carson Group\u2019s Ryan Detrick wrote in a post on X that based on historical analysis, stocks were up 20% on average each time in the year after the Dow hit 10,000, 20,000 and 30,000.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Group Insiders Sell US$25m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "content": "In the last year, many The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$394 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$468. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 27% of Denis Coleman's holding.\n\nInsiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this freelist of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, insiders sold US$15m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$767m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs Group Tell Us?\n\nInsiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Goldman Sachs Group. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Goldman Sachs looks to expand private equity credit lines as dealmaking picks up",
        "content": "By Saeed Azhar\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs is muscling into the lending market for private equity and asset managers, planning an overseas expansion as it helps fill a void left by turmoil at regional banks and the sale of Credit Suisse.\n\nThe Wall Street bank and rivals JPMorgan Chase and PNC Financial Services are stepping up in this $800 billion to $1 trillion market as private equity deal activity is expected to pick up due to record-high fund-raising. Such loans are asset-based and short-term, lowering their risk.Goldman last year bought a portfolio of loan facilities valued at $15 billion from the failed Signature Bank during an auction by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC). \"The focus is to lend to large alternate asset managers, private equity sponsors,\" Maheshwar Saireddy, Goldman Sachs' global head of mortgage and structured products, told Reuters.\n\n\"One of the big initiatives we've been working on is to create more stable revenue in our global banking and markets businesses,\" he said.\n\nAfter bolstering the U.S. business, Goldman plans to expand in Europe, the UK and Asia, and has added staff in Dallas and Bangalore to service these loans, Saireddy said. He did not disclose the expansion's timing.\n\nThe Signature portfolio included loans to private-equity firms and venture capital funds, a key part of its client base, to manage their working capital, known as capital call facilities or subscription line loans.\n\nA subscription line, also called a credit facility, is a loan taken out mostly by closed-end private market funds, secured against the commitments of a fund's investors. It must be repaid over a defined period.\n\nSaireddy said asset-secured lending helps the firm build a growing financing business in fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) and equities. \"We've grown our deposit base tremendously over the past five to seven years,\" Saireddy said. \"And as our deposits are growing so we are trying to line up assets to match those deposits.\" In the first quarter, Goldman Sachs posted record FICC financing revenues of $852 million.\n\nPE ACTIVITY\n\nTo be sure, loans to private equity firms dry up in years when the firms reduce activity, as in 2022 and 2023 when the Fed's monetary tightening led to a drop-off in dealmaking.\n\nCitigroup reduced lending in this market, it said on an earnings call last July, citing an effort to improve returns. The bank declined to comment.\n\nBut the market for subscription line financing was under-served after the collapse of lenders such as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature and the sale of Credit Suisse to UBS last year, allowing new players to step in, analysts say.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Given the supply and demand dynamics where demand has grown significantly, supply hasn't kept up in the last two years, we're seeing some additional banks coming into this space,\" said Greg Fayvilevich, Fitch's global head of funds group told Reuters.\n\nJPMorgan Chase stepped up lending after its acquisition of First Republic Bank last year.\n\n\"We are committed to being the leading financial partner to funds of varying stages and their principals as they fuel the world of high-growth investments,\" said Jeff Kaveney, head of JPMorgan Private Bank's fund banking group, which services private equity and venture capital funds and their principals.\n\nPNC, a large regional lender based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, acquired last year a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature.\n\nCapital constraints at some banks are attracting relatively new players into the market including non-bank lenders, said Rory Callagy, associate managing director with Moody's Private Credit team.\n\nAlternative investment manager Ares is working closely with banks to help free up their capacity to provide subscription line loans, one source familiar with the matter said.\n\n(Reporting by Saeed Azhar; editing by Megan Davies and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Up 11.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Morgan Stanley (MS). Shares have added about 11.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Morgan Stanley due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nMorgan Stanley Q1 Earnings Beat as IB Business Rebounds\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s first-quarter 2024 earnings of $2.02 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. The bottom line compared favorably with $1.70 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThough advisory fees declined 28% year over year, underwriting fees witnessed solid improvement in the quarter. Specifically, equity underwriting income jumped 113% and fixed income underwriting income was up 37%. So, total IB fees (in the Institutional Securities division) grew 16% to $1.45 billion. We had projected it to be $1.26 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company also posted a decent trading performance. Equity trading revenues increased 4% year over year, while fixed-income trading income declined 4%.\r\n\r\nA provision benefit was another tailwind for Morgan Stanley.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite a 30% increase in interest income, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) declined due to higher interest expenses. Also, an increase in total non-interest expenses was a headwind.\r\n\r\nNet income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP) was $3.27 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $2.69 billion.\n\nRevenues Improve, Expenses Rise\n\nQuarterly net revenues were $15.14 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion.\r\n\r\nNII was $1.8 billion, down 23%. We had projected NII of $1.89 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest revenues of $13.34 billion increased 10%. Our estimate for the metric was $12.51 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest expenses were $10.74 billion, up 2%. Our estimate for expenses was $10.67 billion.\r\n\r\nProvision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million against a provision expense of $234 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nQuarterly Segment Performance\n\nInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income was $2.35 billion, up 24% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same was $1.65 billion.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $7.02 billion, up 3% year over year. The upside resulted from increased underwriting revenues and equity trading revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.33 billion.\r\n\r\nWealth Management: Pre-tax income totaled $1.81 billion, up 5% year over year. Our estimate for this was the same as the reported number.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $6.88 billion, up 5%, driven by higher asset management revenues and transactional revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.82 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal client assets were $5.5 trillion as of Mar 31, 2024, up 21% year over year. We had projected the metric to be $5.03 trillion.\r\n\r\nInvestment Management: Pre-tax income was $241 million, jumping 45% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was $241.5 million.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $1.38 billion, up 7%. The improvement is attributable to a rise in asset management and related fees. We had projected revenues of $1.4 billion.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, total assets under management or supervision were $1.51 trillion, up 10% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.47 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCapital Position Solid\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, the book value per share was $55.60, up from $55.13 in the corresponding period of 2022. The tangible book value per share was $41.07, up from $40.68 as of Mar 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 17.2% compared with 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.3%, down from 15.6% a year ago.\n\nShare Repurchase Update\n\nIn the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley repurchased 12 million shares for $1 billion.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nManagement expects the Institutional Securities segment NII to be relatively stable in the second quarter on a sequential basis.\r\n\r\nGiven the current macroeconomic headwinds, wealth management segment pre-tax margins are estimated to be in the mid-20% range.\r\n\r\nThe tax rate is expected to be almost 23%.\n\nLong-Term Objectives\n\nThe company expects an ROTCE of 20% or more. The efficiency ratio is expected to be less than 70%.\r\n\r\nFor the WM segment, the pre-tax margin is projected at more than 30%. Across the WM and IM segments, total client assets are expected to be $10 trillion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Morgan Stanley has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nMorgan Stanley belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Another stock from the same industry, Goldman Sachs (GS), has gained 15.4% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nGoldman is expected to post earnings of $8.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +187.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.5%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of F.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Goldman Strikes $43 Billion Investing Deal for UPS Pension Funds",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. clinched a $43 billion mandate to invest pension fund assets of parcel-delivery company UPS, in one of the largest deals of its kind.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt Jamie Dimon Sees \u2018Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us\u2019 US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed\n\nThe investment mandate announced Thursday pushes Goldman, which manages some $325 billion of such pension assets, closer to its goal of surpassing rivals in the next three to five years. Those rivals include Marsh McLennan\u2019s Mercer, BlackRock Inc. and Russell Investments.\n\nThe multitrillion-dollar global business of taking on investing responsibility for large pools of company pension money \u2014 known as outsourced chief investment office \u2014 or OCIO, is set to grow more than 10% annually over the next five years, according to consulting firm Cerulli Associates. That means money managers are looking at the space as a fruitful source of revenue.\n\n\u201cCorporates look around and look at what others are doing, in a more complicated world from a regulatory, economic and market perspective, and are deciding to narrow their focus on their core business,\u201d Tim Braude, Goldman\u2019s global head for OCIO, said in an interview.\n\nFor Goldman, the OCIO business is a staid part of Marc Nachmann\u2019s asset and wealth division providing a reliable pool of income at scale. He has said that running such portfolios for corporate pension plans and other big investors could be particularly attractive. Nachmann is on a mission to fire up the division providing less volatile results.\n\nAcross the US, buoyant markets and rising rates have turned a subset of corporate pensions \u2014 defined-benefit plans like that of UPS \u2014 from a costly legacy of past promises into an unexpected nest egg.\n\nThe ballooned money pots have begun to overwhelm corporate treasurers and financial officers, who don\u2019t always have the budget to build an in-house investment office.

        "content": "By Pete Schroeder\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jeff Riggs, a Montana businessman who owns a small data center, flew to Washington D.C. in November to meet with his U.S. Senator Steve Daines.\n\nThe trip wasn't his idea. It was arranged, paid for and scripted by Goldman Sachs as part of the bank's aggressive campaign to water down a proposal to raise capital requirements for big banks.\n\nRiggs was one of dozens of small business owners Goldman recruited from all over the country in its battle against the so-called Basel Endgame. Their task in Washington was to urge lawmakers to sign a letter asking the Fed to reconsider the proposal.\n\nThe Wall Street bank set up meetings with members of Congress who have sway over financial regulation, providing employee escorts, talking points, and an agenda timed down to the minute. Goldman's schedule even suggested the tone the entrepreneurs should adopt in the meetings: \"A balance between optimism about growth prospects and difficulty accessing capital.\"\n\nA Reuters review of private Goldman documents, interviews with program participants and public disclosures show how Goldman leveraged its philanthropic 10,000 Small Businesses program to advocate for its own interests.\n\nOthers have reported on banks' efforts to enlist small business owners to lobby against Basel, but this is the first full account of Goldman's grassroots campaign. It illustrates the extreme lengths big U.S banks have taken to try to kill the Basel proposal which they say will force them to overhaul or shut down a range of products and businesses.\n\nAs drafted by the country's top bank regulators, the rule would impose one of the biggest regulatory burdens on the industry since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, raising aggregate capital for the largest U.S. banks by around 16%.\n\nAmong its chief targets are Wall Street banks' lucrative capital markets businesses, which will be subject to stricter risk management measures. The proposal aims to make banks more resilient to potential losses, lowering the risk of failures or bailouts. Banks say that they are already highly capitalized and the changes are unnecessary.\n\nThe rule would not apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets, which provide around 60% of small business bank loans, according to 2020 data from the Small Business Administration (SBA).\n\nA spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said it created the 10,000 Small Businesses program to address challenges entrepreneurs face, including their access to capital, and that visiting Washington has been a productive way for them to raise concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We'll continue to lift their voices on issues that matter to them for years to come.\"\n\nThe program has previously advocated on major small business issues, including COVID-19 aid and federal procurement reform, according to its website.\n\nEVERYDAY ADVOCATES 'MAKE THE ASK'\n\nWhile companies sometimes mobilize everyday Americans to advocate on popular issues in Congress, the strategy is unusual for Wall Street banks, which typically rely on ranks of experts, lawyers and lobbyists to win concessions on highly technical financial rules.\n\n\"To enlist non-financial people and organizations that have nothing to do with the intricacies of financial and bank regulation to come to Washington and plead the case that that regulation is somehow by extension hurting them is something very new,\" said Camden Fine, the former CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a bank lobby group.\n\nReuters was unable to determine how much Goldman spent to fly small business owners to Washington, but its fourth quarter federal lobbying costs of $2.68 million were up roughly fivefold on both the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022, OpenSecrets data shows.\n\nTwo thirds of that amount was spent on \"grassroots lobbying\" for its small business program, Goldman disclosed in a January filing, although it did not provide more details.\n\nLobbying by Goldman and other big banks may have worked. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve which is leading the Basel draft alongside other regulators, said in March they were planning major changes. Reuters had reported hours earlier that the Fed planned to significantly reduce the proposed capital hikes.\n\nWhile participating in the 10,000 Small Businesses program for the second time last year, Riggs mentioned in a program survey that he was struggling to find funding for a project.\n\n\"So they reached out and said 'would you be interested in coming to Washington D.C. and representing small businesses in Montana',\" said Riggs, noting Goldman paid his travel costs.\n\nShepherded by a Goldman executive, Riggs and others from the program also met on the morning of Nov. 14 with Montana's other Senator Jon Tester and its Representative Ryan Zinke, Riggs said. The Senate meetings were scheduled just before bank regulators, including the Fed's top regulatory official, Michael Barr, were due to testify before Congress.\n\nGoldman's agenda allowed four to five minutes for introductions and two to three minutes to frame the Basel conversation within the context of other challenges small businesses have faced, including inflation, a tight labor market and recession worries.\n\nGoldman offered talking points but \"wanted it in our own words,\" said Riggs. He and others then had around 10 minutes to share their experiences before asking lawmakers to sign the letter to the Fed, Goldman's agenda showed.\n\n\"Make the ask, and GS will follow up,\" the bank wrote.\n\nIt also suggested asking for a group photo.\n\n\"This proposal will limit credit availability to small businesses,\" Senator Daines told Barr and the other officials later that morning at the hearing.\n\n\"We had four Montana small business owners in the office here this morning who flew in to express their frustration with this regulation.\"\n\nThat day, Goldman also escorted some of its small business delegates to meet Fed officials, public records show.\n\nSpokespeople for Daines, Tester, Zinke and the Fed either declined or did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'LEND BETTER'\n\nUnveiled in 2009 when Goldman was embroiled in a political firestorm over its role in the financial crisis, the 10,000 Small Businesses program provides training, education and access to capital for small businesses.\n\nIn 2020, the bank launched 10,000 Small Businesses Voices to help entrepreneurs \"advocate for policy changes\" that will benefit them. The bank tapped that initiative to fight Basel.\n\nRiggs said that he does have concerns about accessing affordable capital, but that he banks with small lenders that are not covered by the Basel proposal. Goldman was up front about how it stood to benefit from a less stringent rule when recruiting him, he said.\n\nTwo other small business owners who participated in the meetings told Reuters they rely on a variety of small and large banks, and spoke positively of the Washington experience.\n\nA handful of the country's biggest banks will be hardest hit by Basel. Goldman pointed to data compiled by Washington bank group the Financial Services Forum showing the eight largest U.S. lenders provide 35% of business loans under $100,000. They also meet two-thirds of the bank funding needs of other financial institutions which in turn provide important services to businesses, according to the data.\n\nBut advocates for the rule point out that small business loans account for only around 3.3% of the total assets of banks with $50 billion or more in assets, according to the SBA study.\n\nThey say big banks could easily continue lending to small businesses at the same rates if they reduced dividends, bonuses and stock buybacks.\n\nAccording to Stephen Cecchetti, a professor at the Brandeis International Business School who analyzed aggregate Fed loan data going back more than a decade, there is no clear evidence that higher bank capital requirements have resulted in U.S. banks lending less.\n\nCecchetti, who worked on the international Basel capital standards when he was an economist at the Bank for International Settlements, added in an email: \"There is now increasing evidence that higher capitalized banks lend more and lend better.\"\n\n(Reporting by Pete Schroeder; writing and additional reporting by Michelle Price; editing by Megan Davies and Anna Driver)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The bulls cleared another hurdle. The first-quarter earnings season has been strong. With 92% of S&P 500 companies reporting, the earnings per share beat rate is 78%, near the five-year average. More impressive is the updated first-quarter year-over-year earnings growth rate, which, according to FactSet, now stands at 5.40%, significantly above the 3.40% figure from the end of March.[1] What's more, year-over-year earnings growth estimates for the second quarter have ticked up, from 9% on March 31 to 9.60% as of May 3. Calendar-year S&P 500 per-share earnings are now seen near $244, actually rising in recent weeks, bucking the normal trend of declining earnings per share forecasts during a given year.\n\nWhere's the slowdown?\n\nContinued decent consumer spending, heavy corporate capital expenditure trends (thank you, artificial intelligence) and beefy profit margins all contribute to an environment conducive to both resilient economic output and record company profits. And though the first-quarter U.S. GDP print came in lower than expected, mainly due to weak net export activity and a decline in business inventory, early signs point to an acceleration in the economic expansion rate this quarter.[2]\n\nRate cuts on the horizon in Europe\n\nSo, despite some dire predictions of tepid U.S. real GDP growth in 2024, particularly during the middle of the year, it appears to be a pretty good time if you're a CEO at a multinational corporation. (Alas, we are merely data analysts and researchers!) But things are fine on that front, too, as the unemployment rate in the U.S. remains not far from multidecade lows while the inflation trajectory is generally heading in the right direction. There are even better consumer price trends in overseas markets with the potential for rate cuts sooner rather than later in some developed ex-U.S. economies.[3]\n\nStocks snap back, foreign markets perk up\n\nIn terms of the markets, equities seemed to have gotten through a dose of April malaise. The S&P 500 notched a strong start to May while other countries, namely the U.K., have seen their home indexes notch fresh highs.[4] Even China, a chronic underperformer since early 2021, has enjoyed a quick bullish turnaround, now up by more than 30% from its January nadir. There are clearly some macro tailwinds at play, but investors surely know that volatility can lurk right around the corner. There was a similar feeling of optimism early last summer before a 10% correction reset the playing field before year-end.\n\nConference activity heats back up\n\nWith the bulk of first-quarter earnings reports in the bag, the focus shifts to reading between the lines at corporate conferences. Investment meeting gatherings of top executives, thought leaders, industry experts and Wall Street analysts often produce key insights into the state of narrow niches of the economy. By piecing together tidbits of intel here and there, investors can gain a better understanding of where risk and opportunity may soon assert themselves. Here are some of the major investor conferences on the docket for the balance of the second quarter:\n\nStory continues\n\nInformation Technology & Communication Services\n\nMay 14: Google I/O Developers ConferenceMay 20: JP Morgan 52nd Annual TMT Global Technology Media and Communications ConferenceMay 29: Goldman Sachs Global Semiconductor ConferenceJune 4: Bank of America Global Technology ConferenceJune 5: Citi Regional Tech ConferenceJune 10: Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)June 12: Bank of America Securities Global Technology ConferenceJune 12: Mizuho Technology Conference\n\nHealth Care\n\nMay 14: Capital One Securities 1st Annual Biotech/Biopharma Disrupters EventMay 14: RBC Capital Markets Global Healthcare ConferenceMay 14: Bank of America Securities Global Healthcare ConferenceMay 23: UBS Obesity Therapeutics DayJune 5: Jefferies Global Healthcare ConferenceJune 5: UBS Health Care Services Cape Cod SummitJune 10: Goldman Sachs 45th Annual Global Healthcare ConferenceJune 18: Citi's European Healthcare Conference, LondonJune 20: JP Morgan European Healthcare Conference\n\nConsumer Discretionary & Consumer Staples\n\nMay 14: Goldman Sachs Global Staples ForumMay 18: National Restaurant Association ShowMay 20: Electric Vehicle Innovation SummitMay 21: HSBC Consumer ConferenceMay 23: HSBC 17th Luxury Goods ConferenceJune 4: Morgan Stanley 2nd Annual Travel & Leisure ConferenceJune 4: Bank of America Securities Housing SymposiumJune 4: Deutsche Bank 21st Annual dbAccess Global Consumer ConferenceJune 11: Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry ConferenceJune 11: Evercore ISI 4th Annual Consumer & Retail Conference\n\nFinancials & Real Estate\n\nMay 14: Wells Fargo Financial Services Investor ConferenceMay 14: JP Morgan Insurance ForumMay 14: Janney Montgomery Scott Forth Annual Real Estate ConferenceMay 21: Barclays Leveraged Finance ConferenceMay 29: RBC Capital Markets Virtual Mid-Cap Bank Fixed Income Investor Conference (virtual)May 29: Deutsche Bank AG 14th Annual Global Financial Services ConferenceJune 10: Morgan Stanley 15th Annual US Financials Payments & CRE Conference\n\nIndustrials\n\nMay 15: Bank of America Global Industrials ConferenceMay 21: Wolfe Research 17th Annual Global Transportation & Industrials ConferenceJune 18: Citi Global Freight Field TripJune 11: Wells Fargo Industrials ConferenceJune 24: Goldman Sachs Business Services, Transport & Leisure Conference\n\nEnergy & Utilities\n\nMay 14: Citi's Energy and Climate Technology ConferenceMay 16: Deutsche Bank Global Solar & Clean Tech Conference (virtual)May 16: RBC Future of Water ConferenceMay 18: American Gas Association (AGA) Financial ForumMay 20: JP Morgan Hydrogen Week (virtual)June 3: RBC Capital Markets Global Energy, Power, and Infrastructure ConferenceJune 6: Bank of America Energy Credit ConferenceJune 11: Evercore ISI 3rd Annual Global Clean Energy & Transition Technologies SummitJune 17: JP Morgan Energy, Power & Renewables Conference\n\nMaterials\n\nMay 14: Citi Chemicals ConferenceMay 14: JP Morgan Homebuilding & Building Products ConferenceMay 21: JP Morgan Homebuilders DayMay 22: Raymond James Silver Equities ConferenceMay 28: KeyBanc Capital Markets Industrials & Basic Materials ConferenceJune 13: RBC Capital Markets Global Mining and Materials Conference\n\nRegional\n\nMay 14: Morgan Stanley EEMEA ConferenceMay 15: JP Morgan European Technology, Media, and Telecoms TMT ConferenceMay 16: Morgan Stanley ASEAN Conference (virtual)May 24: Morgan Stanley Flagship Asia Tech Corporate DayMay 27: UBS Asian Investment ConferenceMay 31: Citi Pan Asia Regional Investor ConferenceJune 3: Goldman Sachs Annual European Financial Services ConferenceJune 5: Morgan Stanley China TMT ConferenceJune 6: JP Morgan Frontier Markets Fixed Income Conference\n\nInvestor Specific & Multi-Sector\n\nMay 14: UBS Pan European Small and Mid-Cap ConferenceMay 15: JP Morgan Global Markets ConferenceMay 29: Bank of America Securities Emerging Markets Debt & Equity ConferenceJune 4: Stifel Cross Sector Insight ConferenceJune 5: Deutsche Bank dbAccess 15th Annual Global Industrials, Materials & Building Products ConferenceJune 11: Bank of America C-Suite SMID ConferenceJune 12: Sidoti June Small-Cap ConferenceJune 26: Morningstar Investment Conference\n\n[1] Earnings Insight, FactSet, John Butters, May 10, 2024, https://advantage.factset.com[2] Slow, but solid US economic growth anticipated in Q1; inflation likely heats up, Reuters, Lucia Mutikani, April 25, 2024, https://www.reuters.com[3] Euro zone inflation steady at 2.4%, keeping June rate cut in play as economy returns to growth, CNBC, Jenni Reid, April 30, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com[4] FTSE 100 hits record high, pound slips ahead of BoE verdict, Reuters, Pranav Kashyap, Shubham Batra,Khushi Singh, May 8, 2024, https://www.reuters.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nGoldman Sachs in Focus\n\nBased in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 18.84%. Currently paying a dividend of $2.75 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.4%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.4%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.58%.\n\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $11 is up 4.8% from last year. Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 26.83%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Goldman's payout ratio is 43%, which means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nEarnings growth looks solid for GS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $36.78 per share, with earnings expected to increase 60.82% from the year ago period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that GS is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Goldman Sachs hires from rivals to expand in mid-market deals",
        "content": "(Adds comment from Friedland in paragraph 11)\n\nBy Anirban Sen\n\nNEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs told Reuters it has hired two investment bankers from rival banks as part of a push to advise on more smaller deals worth up to $2 billion.\n\nThe Wall Street investment bank has hired Kerry Burke from Evercore and Eddie Rubin from Lazard. Burke, who focused on the retail and apparel sectors at Evercore, will join Goldman in August, while Rubin, who advises on deals in the digital infrastructure industry, joined the bank in April.\n\nBest known for its advisory work on mega deals, Goldman has in recent years been working to expand in so-called middle-market transactions to boost and diversify its revenue.\n\nGoldman set up the unit, called the cross markets group (CMG), in 2019 and tasked veteran banker David Friedland to run it, as the bank sought to increase its share of fees from advising on smaller acquisitions.\n\n\"Our people who are doing middle-market deals are excited about the entrepreneurial aspect of the business - they deal with family-owned businesses, founder-run businesses, sponsor portfolio companies and companies that are growing rapidly. This is all highly attractive business for GS,\" said Friedland, who is a partner at Goldman.\n\nFriedland has held various titles during his 26 years at Goldman and spent a majority of his career advising top clients in the consumer and retail industry. Notable deals Friedland has advised on include Brookfield Property's takeover of mall operator GGP, and Las Vegas Sands' $6.3 billion sale of its Vegas properties, including the Venetian casino resort.\n\nThe CMG unit, which currently houses 200 employees, focuses on covering seven industries - consumer & retail, real estate, financial institutions, technology media & telecom, industrials, healthcare and natural resources. Goldman has assigned 10 investment bankers to focus on coverage of five of those sectors, while another banker, Todd Byers, was recently tasked with driving private equity dealmaking.\n\nOver the past few years, top boutique investment banks including Evercore, Centerview Partners and PJT Partners, embarked on aggressive hiring sprees for top dealmakers as they sought to capture a bigger share of advice on mega deals that generate huge paydays for advisers.\n\nThat strategy has resulted in more opportunities for Wall Street powerhouses like Goldman, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase to pick up fees on middle-market deals that are being passed on by boutique advisory firms and other top-tier rivals.\n\nMoreover, a slowdown in dealmaking coupled with a tougher regulatory environment has forced top banks to hunt for newer opportunities to generate fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nFriedland pointed out that having a big balance sheet and capital markets expertise also gives large banks an advantage on deals over boutique advisory firms that focus only on M&A advisory.\n\nAccording to data from Dealogic, the number of M&A transactions worth between $500 million and $2 billion has risen 19% in the Americas and EMEA to 206 so far this year. Goldman has advised on 39 of those deals this year, up 44% from the same period last year. (Reporting by Anirban Sen in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Michael Erman)\n\nView comments",

Goldman has assigned 10 investment bankers to focus on coverage of five of those sectors, while another banker, Todd Byers, was recently tasked with driving private equity dealmaking.\n\nOver the past few years, top boutique investment banks including Evercore, Centerview Partners and PJT Partners, embarked on aggressive hiring sprees for top dealmakers as they sought to capture a bigger share of advice on mega deals that generate huge paydays for advisers.\n\nThat strategy has resulted in more opportunities for Wall Street powerhouses like Goldman, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase to pick up fees on middle-market deals that are being passed on by boutique advisory firms and other top-tier rivals.\n\nMoreover, a slowdown in dealmaking coupled with a tougher regulatory environment has forced top banks to hunt for newer opportunities to generate fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nFriedland pointed out that having a big balance sheet and capital markets expertise also gives large banks an advantage on deals over boutique advisory firms that focus only on M&A advisory.\n\nAccording to data from Dealogic, the number of M&A transactions worth between $500 million and $2 billion has risen 19% in the Americas and EMEA to 206 so far this year. Goldman has advised on 39 of those deals this year, up 44% from the same period last year.\n\n(Reporting by Anirban Sen in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Michael Erman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The recent war between Israel and the Palestine-based militant group Hamas has affected the global supply chain. Also, the prevailing war between Russia and Ukraine has prompted several governments, including the Biden administration, to impose sanctions on Russian oil and energy.\n\nCrude prices have gone up on supply concerns from Russia, which is one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of the commodity. Prices have risen further after the U.S. government imposed a ban on the import of oil and other energy products.\n\nGeopolitical tensions are likely to keep markets volatile for some time, with the energy sector making the most of the opportunity. So, investing in funds with exposure to energy equities is likely to help in the near term.\n\nBelow, we share with you three top-ranked energy mutual funds, viz.,\u00a0Fidelity Select Energy FSENX, Goldman Sachs MLP Energy Infras GLPAX and T. Rowe Price New Era PRNEX.Each has a\u00a0Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1\u00a0(Strong Buy) and is expected to outperform its peers in the future.

        "title": "Goldman Raises $3.6 Billion for New Real Estate Credit Fund",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s alternatives business raised $3.6 billion for its latest real estate credit fund, giving it firepower at a time of market dislocation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind GameStop Shares Soar as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Revitalizes Meme Mania China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts\n\nThat figure eclipses the roughly $2.6 billion that Goldman raised from third-party investors for a predecessor vehicle, and marks the largest pool of capital the firm has amassed for the effort.\n\nSome banks have pulled back from commercial real estate lending, leaving certain landlords struggling to secure financing in this era of higher interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe strategy really is to capitalize on what we think is a growing supply-and-demand gap for real estate debt financing,\u201d Richard Spencer, chief investment officer for real estate credit at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, said in an interview Monday.\n\nThe bank is also investing $1.4 billion of balance sheet capital alongside the fund, known as West Street Real Estate Credit Partners IV, which will be amplified with around $2 billion in leverage, giving it lending capacity of more than $7 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified citing private information. The vehicle is targeting returns of around 10% to 12% after fees, the people said.\n\nThe new fund will seek to originate, underwrite and hold loans backed by high-quality real estate, Spencer said. Through the vehicle, Goldman will aim to make first-lien mortgages secured by what it describes as \u201ctransitional\u201d real estate, or properties undergoing refurbishment, a change of use or even development. The fund will also seek to provide mezzanine financing related to leased and stabilized properties.\n\nThe vehicle has already committed more than $1.8 billion, said Spencer and Jim Garman, global head of real estate at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, without providing specific details on those investments.\n\nGoldman\u2019s new fund will be able to invest in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, countries in the Asia-Pacific region, a broader remit than its prior fund\u2019s focus on North America and Europe. It\u2019ll focus efforts in the region on Australia, in part because of the country\u2019s strong creditor protections as well as regulatory pressure on traditional lenders to reduce risk, Spencer said.\n\nThe firm, which has provided commercial real estate loans in cities such as New York and Paris, may focus on lending against residential, industrial, hospitality and select office properties that are benefiting from shifts in technology, demographics and sustainability, Spencer said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSovereign-wealth funds, insurance companies, pension plans, family offices and wealth-management clients backed the vehicle, according to the bank, which declined to provide more details.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Corporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on a hot streak, rising each of the first nine days of May. According to Barron\u2019s, only three of the index\u2019s 30 components \u2014 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) \u2014 dropped in that time. Meanwhile, Amgen (NYSE:AMGN), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have all been on hot streaks in May. Conversely, 80% of the S&P 500 rose during the same time frame. Some of its key components, including CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), have tumbled more than 10% in May. It appears that investors are starting to grow less thrilled with technology and AI for the time being. That trend is beneficial for the Dow, which is much less tech-oriented than the S&P 500. Specifically, 30% of the S&P 500\u2019s components are in the tech sector versus only 19% of Dow stocks. For investors wanting to exploit the Dow\u2019s new-found strength, here are the three best Dow stocks to buy in May.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is clearly continuing to benefit significantly from the strength of the upper-middle class and wealthy consumers. Adobe Analytics recently reported that online retail spending in America jumped 7% in the first four months of the year.\n\nSo it\u2019s unsurprising that in the first quarter, American Express\u2019 EPS soared 27% YOY to $3.33. Meanwhile, its top line advanced 12% YOY to $15.8 billion. Given the large increase of the company\u2019s bottom line, its forward price-earnings ratio of 18.6 times is quite attractive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll of these factors make American Express one of the best Dow stocks to buy in May.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is getting a big lift from the improvements of the stock, credit and IPO markets, along with increased M&A activity. The firm will likely get a boost from the Fed\u2019s determination to cut interest rates, as this will benefit nearly all of its operating markets.\n\nAs of last month, GS stock has been identified as one of the top American equities by Bank of America. Additionally, Argus raised its rating on the shares to \u201cBuy,\u201d citing the rejuvenation of the firm\u2019s investment banking business. Argus expects Goldman\u2019s investment banking unit to continue to deliver strong returns going forward. The huge investment bank\u2019s underwriting business expanded last quarter, while M&A activity jumped nearly 20% last quarter industrywide YOY.\n\nIndicating that the Street is warming up to GS stock, the shares have climbed almost 17% in the last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmgen CEO Robert Bradway\u00a0recently reported that he was encouraged by the interim results of a Phase 2 trial of the company\u2019s weight-loss drug, MariTide. Bradway noted that he was confident that the treatment would help patients. The firm did not release any Phase 2 data on the drug, but it\u2019s expected to do so later this year. Some evidence indicates that MariTide helps patients keep weight off even after discontinuing the drug. That would be an important, key differentiator for MariTide compared to competing treatments. Additionally, MariTide is administered monthly, while the leading, currently available weight-loss drugs have to be taken weekly.\n\nInvestment bank William Blair upgraded Amgen to \u201cOutperform\u201d in the wake of the news. The bank thinks the drug can be a multi-blockbuster and believes that it can reduce patients\u2019 weight by 20% or more.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held GS bonds and long positions in INTC and AMZN.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 13, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Stocks Driving the Dow's Market-Beating Performance\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average emerged stronger than the other two major indices in the latest market rally, driven by renewed hopes of rate cuts, solid corporate earnings and increased stock buybacks. The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year.\n\nWhile 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen, Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Boeing and The Goldman Sachs Group.\n\nThe outperformance came as the market\u2019s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer.\n\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\n\nThe blue-chip index also benefited from Apple\u2019s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\n\nAnother big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index.\n\nFurther, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nAmgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets. The stock has risen 14.5% so far this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmgen saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It jumped nearly 9% over the past seven days and saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year in the same time frame.\n\nAMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nApple designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories worldwide. The company offers iPhone, a line of smartphones, Mac, a line of personal computers, iPad, a line of multi-purpose tablets, and wearables, home, and accessories comprising AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products and HomePod. Shares of AAPL are up 8% so far this month.\n\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending September 2024) with an estimated earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nBoeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades. The company\u2019s premier jet aircraft along with varied defense products position it as one of the largest defense contractors in the United States. It has a solid estimated earnings growth of 95.9% for this year.\n\nBoeing has risen 8% so far this month. It has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. It has risen 6.8% so far this month.\n\nGoldman saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 71 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 60.8%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 currently.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

The tightening of standards for commercial real estate loans decreased to a two-year low, with foreign banks experiencing increased demand for such loans. Regarding household loans, more banks tightened standards for auto loans, while fewer did so for credit cards and other consumer loans.

        "title": "With 71% ownership in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Goldman Sachs Group's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company Recent sales by insiders\n\nIf you want to know who really controls The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 71% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$5.6b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 47%.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Goldman Sachs Group, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Goldman Sachs Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Goldman Sachs Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 5.8% of the stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs Group\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$755m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Goldman Sachs Group has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year.\r\n\r\nWhile 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS.\r\n\r\nThe outperformance came as the market\u2019s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\r\n\r\nThe blue-chip index also benefited from Apple\u2019s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\r\n\r\nAnother big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index.\r\n\r\nFurther, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nAmgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets. The stock has risen 14.5% so far this month.\r\n\r\nAmgen saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.\r\n\r\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It jumped nearly 9% over the past seven days and saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nAMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nApple designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories worldwide. The company offers iPhone, a line of smartphones, Mac, a line of personal computers, iPad, a line of multi-purpose tablets, and wearables, home, and accessories comprising AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products and HomePod. Shares of AAPL are up 8% so far this month.\r\n\r\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending September 2024) with an estimated earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nBoeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades. The company\u2019s premier jet aircraft along with varied defense products position it as one of the largest defense contractors in the United States. It has a solid estimated earnings growth of 95.9% for this year.\r\n\r\nBoeing has risen 8% so far this month. It has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. It has risen 6.8% so far this month.\r\n\r\nGoldman saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 71 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 60.8%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 currently.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "As May 2024 kicks off, investors are keen on bolstering their portfolios with the best dividend stocks to buy now. These stocks represent companies that regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders.\n\nThe appeal lies in the ability to receive passive income in the form of cash payments on top of potential share price appreciation. While the allure of finding the following big growth stock is strong, dividend stocks provide investors with an unmatched sense of stability. As you hunt for the best income stocks to buy, it is crucial to consider that a high yield alone will not yield the best results.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the best dividend stocks to buy in May 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is undoubtedly one of the best dividend stocks to buy now.

In their latest quarterly results, revenue increased 7% YOY to $5.3 billion.

        "title": "Vanguard Joins Pimco in Seeing More BOJ Hikes Than Market",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc.\u2019s Ales Koutny says the market is underestimating just how hawkish the Bank of Japan will need to be this year to boost the beleaguered yen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Apologizes for iPad Pro Ad, Scraps Plan to Air It on TV \u2018Seriously Underwater\u2019 Home Mortgages Tick Up Across the US Biden Set to Impose Tariffs on China EVs, Strategic Sectors Marjorie Taylor Greene Finally Got What She Deserved: Defeat\n\nThe asset manager\u2019s head of international rates sees the central bank\u2019s benchmark reaching 0.75% by year-end, from a range of 0% to 0.1% now, with a quarter-point hike as soon as June. In contrast, the market has priced in just 21 basis points of additional hikes by the end of the year, swaps indicate.\n\nHis view aligns with that of fellow bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co., which also sees three quarter-point hikes in the cards this year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists, meanwhile, expect rate increases to as high as 1.5% by 2027.\n\nJapan finally raised interest rates out of negative territory in March. But the yen subsequently resumed its decline, tumbling to its weakest in more than three decades against the dollar last month given the chasm between Japanese and US borrowing costs. Japan\u2019s government likely responded to the slide by intervening in the foreign-exchange market last week to support its currency.\n\n\u201cWe think markets are underpricing the BOJ,\u201d Koutny said in an interview on Wednesday at the firm\u2019s London offices, arguing that authorities will be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with a dollar-yen rate above 155. \u201cFor all the noise last week about intervention, we are already above that again. They understand that the only way to really get out of that is for Japan to send a fairly hawkish message.\u201d\n\nThe pair traded around 155.75 on Friday in Tokyo. That leaves the yen down about 9% this year versus the dollar, the worst performance among Group-of-10 currencies.\n\nWhy the Yen Is So Weak and What That Means for Japan: QuickTake\n\nVanguard, which has over $1.6 trillion in actively managed assets, is betting on higher short-term swap rates and is short Japanese government bond futures given expectations for the BOJ to taper its quantitative easing. The BOJ owns more than half of the nation\u2019s government bond market after years of buying.\n\nThe firm also used the yen\u2019s recent rally to increase its short position on the view that intervention fundamentally doesn\u2019t work, Koutny said. The yen plunged through 160 last week after the BOJ held rates steady at its late-April meeting, triggering two suspected rounds of intervention.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe currency will only manage a \u201ccontinuous bullish move\u201d toward fair value \u2014 which Vanguard sees around 100 per dollar \u2014 if the global economy sees a significant slowdown, prompting Japanese investors to reduce their foreign asset exposure, he said. In the short-term, the firm would turn neutral on the yen if the BOJ starts to reduce QE or hikes rates.\n\nA summary released Thursday of the BOJ\u2019s April policy meeting hinted at the possibility of faster rate hikes, as board members considered the risks posed by inflation and the yen\u2019s depreciation.\n\nGoldman Sachs sees rate increases of 25 basis points semi-annually until the policy rate\u2019s target range reaches levels between 1.25% and 1.5% in 2027, although the timings of hikes are uncertain and depend on economic and inflation trends, economists including Tomohiro Ota wrote in note dated Thursday.\n\nA sale of Japanese 10-year government notes drew tepid investor demand on Wednesday, reflecting a reluctance to buy given the risk of a selloff with the BOJ projected to end its bond-buying program and tighten again. Still, that repricing would likely trigger a flood of inflows from both domestic and overseas buyers, which would also help the yen, Vanguard\u2019s Koutny said.\n\n\u201cAs long as Japan keeps delaying the reassessment of its path, we\u2019re going to see a lack of demand for the bonds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once that proper reassessment happens, we would be quite keen to buy JGBs for our portfolios.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Yumi Teso.\n\n(Adds Goldman Sachs economists\u2019 rate forecast.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

The figure marked the highest earnings in 14 years for Goldman. The company was the most profitable among global banks that closed their books in the country on Dec. 31.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG\u2019s bottom line for its securities business grew 43% to 17.2 billion yen, the Frankfurt-based lender\u2019s best showing in at least six years. Barclays Plc posted a record profit for the London-based bank\u2019s brokerage unit in the Asian nation.\n\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s historic shift in monetary policy has helped revive volatility in the country\u2019s roughly $7 trillion government bond market, generating more money-making opportunities for traders. With compensation at banks in Tokyo in many cases a fraction of other financial hubs, it has already sparked competition for talent with hedge funds.\n\nDealmaking, in share sales as well as mergers and acquisitions, is also booming in Japan. Japan-related deals accounted for 22% of Asia\u2019s entire transaction volumes for 2023, the highest in four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201c2023 was a year in which Japan business drew the spotlight at global banks\u201d as they faced a relatively tough time elsewhere because of lackluster deal-making and other headwinds, said Hideyasu Ban, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nBank of America Corp.\u2019s brokerage unit, the only firm on the list to report a loss, booked fewer gains from debt trading in addition to more transaction costs, according to a filing. Other major global banks including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. will announce their results later because their securities subsidiaries closed their books on March 31.\n\n--With assistance from Masaki Kondo.\n\n(Updates with dealmaking activity in fifth paragraph and chart after last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "Big banks complete climate analysis for Fed while Powell tries to avoid becoming climate policymaker",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve disclosed results from an assessment of how big US banks would be impacted by climate change, an exercise that created new political tensions for the central bank.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) found that 20-50% of their commercial and residential real estate loans in the Northeast would be impacted by the most severe climate shock\u2014 defined as having no insurance coverage for a once-in-200-year event under events including hurricanes, flooding and wildfires.\n\nThe impact would be a change in the estimated probability of default on those loans.\n\nThe banks were tasked with determining how heatwaves, wildfires, higher average temperatures, a hurricane in the Northeast and another hazard of their choosing would affect their residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Pedestrians approach JPMorgan Chase headquarters, in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut they had a difficult time trying to model climate risks to assess the impact on loan portfolios, noting significant challenges gathering data and measuring climate-related risks.\n\nThe goal was for the Fed to better understand banks' risk-management approaches to this issue so it can manage the risks climate poses to the wider financial system.\n\nThe climate analysis was exploratory and did not come with any penalties for banks, unlike a separate annual stress test run by the Fed designed to determine whether banks can withstand severe economic shocks.\n\nYet the act of the test itself created new political complications for the central bank and Chairman Jay Powell, who has gone out of his way in public speeches to make it clear the Fed would avoid making climate policy.\n\n\"Policies to address climate change are the business of elected officials and those agencies that they have charged with this responsibility\" he said during a speech last month at Stanford University. \"The Fed has received no such charge.\" Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell speaks at Stanford University last month. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\n\"We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,\" he said during his speech, pledging to avoid \"mission creep.\"\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped lawmakers and other policy makers from criticizing Powell on this subject.\n\nHis remarks on climate came roughly two weeks after Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse sent a letter to Powell arguing the Fed\u2019s high interest rates were delaying clean energy developments.\n\nSen. Whitehouse told Yahoo Finance last month that other central banks around the world closely consider climate change because \"if left unchecked climate change will pose 'systemic risks' to our financial system and the broader economy.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd Republicans have also repeatedly come down on Powell for considering rules that would test banks' ability to withstand climate-related scenarios, arguing it falls out of the scope of the Fed's authority.\n\nNot everyone within the Fed agrees with the approach, either.\n\nLast May, Fed Governor Chris Waller said he doesn\u2019t believe climate change poses a serious risk to the US financial system even as the central bank tested the resilience of banks under different climate scenarios. Fed governor Christopher Waller. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) (Sarah Silbiger via Getty Images)\n\n\"Climate change is real, but I do not believe it poses a serious risk to the safety and soundness of large banks or the financial stability of the United States,\" Waller said in a speech in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\"I don't see a need for special treatment for climate-related risks in our financial stability monitoring and policies,\" he added.\n\nBut Powell maintains that the central bank has a narrow role that relates to supervising banks.\n\n\"The public will expect that the institutions we regulate and supervise will understand and be able to manage the material risks that they face, which, over time, are likely to include climate-related financial risks,\" Powell said on April 3.\n\n\"We will remain alert to the risk that there will be pressure to expand that role over time.\"\n\nBanks used different approaches to develop the physical and transition risk scenarios required by the Fed and to translate these scenarios into climate-adjusted credit risk parameters.\n\nThey also noted the need to monitor changes across the insurance industry, including changes in insurance costs over time, and the impacts of those changes on consumers and businesses in specific markets and segments.\n\nBank\u2019s estimates of climate-adjusted credit risk parameters, such as probability of default, showed significant differences in impact across sectors, regions, and counterparties.\n\nThe exercise was exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences.\n\nDrawing on lessons learned from the exercise, the Fed said it will continue to engage with participating banks regarding their capacity to measure and manage climate-related financial risks.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 largest banks in the US by customers. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Largest Banks in the US by Customers.\n\nBanking Industry in the US: An Overview\n\nThe failure of prominent US banks including Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), First Republic Bank (FRB), and Signature Bank (SBNY) has resulted in a continued increase in the short interest rate across the country. According to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence data, short loan value in terms of percentage of market capitalization went from 0.29% to 0.46% between January 1st, 2022 and March 10th, 2023.\n\nOne of the primary forces driving the banking industry through such unfavorable circumstances is the increase in the adoption of digital banking. Estimates by the Bank Administrative Institute Banking Outlook: 2024 Trends show that by 2026, bank customers will likely use online banking and other digital channels for 65% of their financial transactions. Furthermore, data from the FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households revealed that more than 43% of consumers considered digital banking their primary route for financial transactions in 2021. With customers flocking to flexible and easily accessible digital channels for their financial needs, more and more financial institutions are embracing digital platforms. This increase in adoption has resulted in a snowball effect on market growth.\n\nData from the Federal Reserve's report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households 2022 revealed that 6% of families are unbanked, while 13% adults used money orders or nonbank check chasing, down by 3% from 2019. Moreover, 11% of adults with a bank account paid an overdraft fee in the prior 12 months. This number remained unchanged from 2021. You can also look at 25 Largest Banks in the World by Assets.\n\nEffects on Bank Account Ownership due to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new age of digital banking adoption, but it also affected the status of bank account ownership across the globe. The FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households inquired people about possible changes in their economic condition since the spread of the pandemic in March 2020, and to what extent such changes affected the opening or closing of their bank accounts. According to data collected by the survey, around 34.9% people opened a bank account since March 2020, primarily because they received a government benefit payment. Such benefit payments include pandemic stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, and others. On the other hand, around 21.2% of unbanked households, which comes up to about one in five people, closed a bank account since March 2020 because of reduced working hours, loss of a job, being furloughed, or experiencing a significant income loss. The number of people using banks across the United States thus experienced significant ups and downs due to the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Players in the Banking Industry\n\nThe top 5 banks in the United States control 41.2% of the domestic market in terms of assets. According to data from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, these top 5 banks in descending order of their consolidated assets are JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) .

On February 6, Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is set to open 500 new bank branch locations across the United States by 2027.

The new JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) branches are likely to open in Charlotte, Boston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and areas surrounding Washington D.C. This multi-billion dollar project is expected to expand the bank's number of customers served every year to new bounds.\n\nThe Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reported $2.54 trillion in consolidated assets, and $2.40 trillion in domestic assets in 2023 in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to data by the Federal Reserve Statistical Release. On March 6, Reuters reported that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) made a new record by securing 644 patents across the United States in 2023. These numbers increased by 13% between 2022 and 2023, primarily because of its increased focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and information security. Aditya Bhasin, BofA's Chief Technology and Information Officer, said that:\n\n\"Innovation is everybody's business - this is not a lab or some small group tucked away. We are thinking about how AI can be used to make us able to serve our clients better.\"\n\nErica, the virtual assistant for The Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), also uses patented technology to boost customer experience. It alerts customers about their spending habits, and also sends out reminders of recurring transactions.\n\nWells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) is the third most prominent player in the banking industry. It reported $1.73 trillion in consolidated assets and $1.70 trillion in domestic assets in 2023 in Sioux Fall, South Dakota. On March 14, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) reported that the company is set to join hands with ICON to fund the global architecture competition for building houses for the under-housed.

I'll begin the call by providing a brief overview of our first quarter results and then discuss the current market environment in more detail. I'll then turn the call over to David and Tucker to describe our portfolio activity and performance before handing it off to Stan to take us through our financial results. And then finally, we'll open the line for Q&A. With that, let's get to our first quarter results. Our net investment income per share for the quarter was $0.55 and net asset value per share was $14.55, a decrease of approximately 0.5%, or $0.07 from the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur net investment income again exceeded our quarterly dividend, but the excess was offset by net realized and unrealized losses during the quarter, which led to the slight decrease in NAV. On a fair value basis, first lien loans represent 96.5% of our assets as of March 31st, which reflects our bias towards maintaining exposure to credits that are higher up in the capital structure. Consistent with prior quarters, all new investment commitments this quarter were the first lien credits. As we announced after the market closed yesterday, our board declared a second quarter dividend of $0.45 per share payable to shareholders of record as of June 28, 2024. This marks the company's 37th consecutive quarter of a $0.45 per share dividend totaling $16.65 per share since our IPO, excluding the special dividends we paid in 2021 following the merger with MMLC.\n\nNow, with respect to broader market conditions, the syndicated loan market rebounded significantly in the first quarter, taking back share from direct lenders, mainly in companies with larger enterprise values. We saw this trend on the large cap side of our private credit platform. However, we believe direct lenders will continue to find attractive opportunities to deploy capital where borrowers and their private equity sponsors value the certainty and flexibility that private credit provides. As an example of that dynamic, we served as the largest lead lender and administrative agent in a loan to EQT in connection with their acquisition of Zeus, a manufacturer of critical components in the medical and industrial end markets. USA DeBusk is another example where our private credit platform was the lead lender and administrative agent.\n\nUSA DeBusk provides industrial cleaning and specialty services supporting routine maintenance and refurbishments at chemical plants, refining and renewable facilities and other industrial infrastructure. Given our ability to draw on the broader Goldman Sachs platform, including our investment bank, GSBD and the private credit platform are poised to benefit from the significant backlog of sponsor activity that's channeling through our M&A franchise. In addition, to add or refinancing activity from our existing portfolio companies, we remain confident that the $1.2 trillion of private equity dry powder and the pressure to return capital to LP investors will serve as a catalyst to restart what has been a relatively muted sponsor M&A market, and we're starting to see a significant pickup in activity in our pipeline.\n\nDespite a lower than normal deal environment a year ago, first quarter M&A volumes were up 34% year-over-year off of a 15-year low of sponsor activity in 2023. And we saw a good mix of public-to-private, sponsor-to-sponsor and strategic acquisitions of portfolio companies, which also led to some nice harvests. Pressure on sponsors to monetize portfolio companies from legacy vintages will only continue to benefit private credit. It's worth noting that while we're seeing continued spread compression from supply demand dynamics, credit fundamentals have remained in line with our expectations and recent originations are still exhibiting sensible overall leverage levels and low LTVs. Again, we remain committed to leveraging the broader private credit and Goldman Sachs platform for the benefit of GSBD shareholders in the quarters and years ahead.\n\nWith that, let me turn it over to my co-CEO, David Miller.\n\nDavid Miller: Thanks Alex. During the quarter, we originated $359.6 million in new investment commitments to seven new and thirteen existing portfolio companies. Sales and repayment activity totaled $115.7 million, primarily driven by the full repayment of investments in four portfolio companies. In particular, as we continue to upgrade the quality of the portfolio, we are pleased with a full repayment of one junior lien and an exit of an equity position. Turning to portfolio composition, as of March 31, 2024, total investments in our portfolio were $3.4 billion at fair value, comprised of 97.5% in senior secured loans, including 91.9% first lien, 4.6% in first lien last out unit tranche and 1% in second lien, as well as a negligible amount in unsecured debt and 1.9% in a combination of preferred and common stock and warrants. A financial trader actively managing a portfolio of stocks on a high-definition LED touchscreen.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the company held investments in 149 portfolio companies operating across 39 different industries. The weighted average yield of our investment portfolio at amortized cost at the end of the first quarter was 11.9% as compared to 11.8% from the prior quarter. The weighted average yield of our total debt and income producing investments at amortized cost at the end of the first quarter was 12.7% as compared to 12.6% at the end of Q4. I will now turn the call over to Tucker Greene to discuss overall credit quality.\n\nTucker Greene: Thank you, David. The weighted average net debt to EBITDA of the companies in our investment portfolio remained flat at 6.1 times during the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. Importantly, our portfolio companies have both top line growth and EBITDA growth year-over-year on a weighted average basis. The weighted average interest coverage of the companies in our investment portfolio at quarter end remained flat at 1.5 times in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. And finally turning to asset quality. During the quarter, Specialty Dental Brands, also known as LCG Vardiman Black, a first lien debt position that was restructured, and NPI, a second lien position, were both restored to accrual status.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, investments on nonaccrual status decreased to 1.6% of the total investment portfolio at fair value from 2.3% as of December 31, 2023, and 3.3% of the total investment portfolio at amortized cost from 3.8% as of December 31, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Stan Matuszewski to walk through our financial results.\n\nStan Matuszewski: Thank you, Tucker. We ended the first quarter of 2024 with total portfolio investments at fair value of $3.4 billion, outstanding debt of $1.8 billion, and net assets of $1.6 billion. Our ending net debt to equity ratio as of the end of the first quarter was 1.10 times, which continues to be below our target leverage of 1.25 times. During the quarter, we closed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due in 2027. The 2027 notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.375%. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2027 notes were used to pay down a portion of our secured revolving credit facility. At quarter end approximately 68% of the company's total principal amount of debt outstanding was in unsecured debt and we had $1.111 million [ph] of capacity available under our secured revolving credit facility.\n\nIn addition to our newly issued 2027 notes, we have two separate unsecured notes due in February 2025 and January 2026, respectively. We plan to address these maturities at the necessary time. Before continuing to the income statement, as a reminder, in addition to GAAP financial measures, we will also reference certain non-GAAP or adjusted measures. This is intended to make the company's financial results easier to compare to results prior to our October 2020 merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. or MMLC. These non-GAAP measures remove the purchase discount amortization impact from our financial results. For the first quarter, GAAP and adjusted after tax net investment income was $60.8 million and $59.5 million, respectively, as compared to $61.8 million and $60.7 million, respectively in the prior quarter.\n\nOn a per share basis, GAAP net investment income was $0.55, excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting in connection with the merger with MMLC, adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $0.54 per share, equating to an annualized net investment income yield on book value of 14.8%. Total investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $111.5 million and $115.4 million, respectively. The decrease in total investment income was primarily driven by a decrease in accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts. We would note, however, that we did see an increase in PIK income as a percentage of total investment income, primarily driven by the restructuring of certain investments.\n\nDistributions during the quarter remained consistent at $0.45 per share. Our spillover taxable income is approximately $128.9 million, or $1.15 on a per share basis, which we believe provides continued stability on our consistent dividend since inception. With that, I'll turn it back to Alex for closing remarks.\n\nAlex Chi: Thanks, Stan, and thanks everyone, for joining our earnings call. We remain optimistic about the performance of our portfolio, the current environment, and the outlook for deployment into attractive opportunities. With that, let's open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator: Thank you.

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Morgan Stanley,  The Goldman Sachs and Piper Sandler",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 , 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Morgan Stanley MS, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Piper Sandler Companies PIPR.\n\nIndustry: Investment Banks\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2270315/3-investment-banks-to-buy-on-flourishing-industry-prospects\n\nGiven the reversal in corporate debt and equity issuances and deal-making activities, the Zacks Investment Bank industry is expected to witness a turnaround in investment banking fees in the quarters ahead.\n\nAlso, decent client activity in the trading business is expected to continue as uncertainty-induced volatility is likely to persist in the near term. While costs related to technological upgrades might impede bottom-line growth, industry players will eventually witness improved operating efficiency. These factors will keep aiding investment banks like Morgan Stanley, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Piper Sandler Companies.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Investment Bank industry consists of firms that provide financial products and services that include advisory-based financial transactions to corporations, governments and financial institutions worldwide. These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary equity offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&As).\n\nGradually, the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management. Therefore, the industry players work mainly through three product segments \u2014 investment banking (M&As, advisory services and securities underwriting), asset management and trading and principal investments (proprietary and brokerage trading).\n\n3 Themes to Influence the Investment Bank Industry\n\nResurgence in Underwriting and Advisory Businesses: After a sustained weakness in underwriting, IPOs and deal-making activities since 2022 due to geopolitical tensions, global supply-chain disruptions, aggressive monetary policy tightening worldwide to control inflation and potential recession risks, green shoots in advisory and underwriting businesses are visible with the deal pipeline looking healthy.\n\nWith the macroeconomic environment steadying and the corporates globally adjusting to the high-rate regime, global underwriting and M&A activities are expected to rebound in the coming days. Though the ride will likely be bumpy for investment banks in the near term, the improving operating backdrop will support the industry players\u2019 revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading Business Offers Some Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Since 2022, market volatility has significantly increased due to several geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. Though there has been some stability in the macroeconomic backdrop, markets continue to grapple with high global inflation, high interest rates and other geopolitical matters. So, trading volumes will likely remain decent, driven by solid client activities in equity and fixed-income businesses, thereby boosting industry players\u2019 trading income.\n\nTechnology to Improve Operating Efficiency: Innovative trading platforms, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and investments in technology and advertising are likely to aid the operations of investment banks. The industry players are attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending heavily on technology to help clients with infrastructure development and new platforms. While investment banks will likely face increasing technology-related expenses in the near term, these initiatives are expected to improve operating efficiency over time.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Investment Bank industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #23, which places it in the top 9% of more than 245 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 34.2% upward.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to bet on, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Investment Bank industry has underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past year. While stocks in the industry have collectively gained 36.4%, the S&P 500 composite has rallied 26.2% and the Zacks Finance sector has risen 23.7%.\n\nIndustry Valuation\n\nOne might get a good sense of the industry\u2019s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), commonly used for valuing investment banks because of significant variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.\n\nThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.68X, above the median level of 3.31X, over the past five years. The industry is trading at a considerable discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 10.96X and the median level is 10.33X.\n\nFinance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, so comparing investment banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, comparing the group\u2019s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector\u2019s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 4.79 and the median level of 4.34 for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank industry\u2019s respective ratios.\n\n3 Investment Banks Worth Investing\n\nMorgan Stanley: This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock operates globally as an investment banking, securities and investment management company. Based in New York, the key source of Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings stability is its business diversification initiatives. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been undertaking several initiatives aimed at increasing reliable revenue sources. Strategic expansion efforts, including the acquisitions of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks, are in sync with its efforts to focus less on a capital markets-driven revenue mix.\n\nIn a move that signals their commitment to further collaboration and innovation, last year, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. and Morgan Stanley announced the launch of \"Alliance 2.0\". This will see combined Japanese equity research, sales and execution services for institutional clients at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. Also, their equity underwriting business will be rearranged between the two brokerage units. These efforts will solidify the company\u2019s position in Japan\u2019s market.\n\nA favorable macroeconomic backdrop is expected to revive its investment banking (IB) business, thereby further strengthening Morgan Stanley\u2019s financials going forward. The demand for both advisory and underwriting businesses will likely rise as corporates realize that higher interest rates are here to stay for a longer period.\n\nThough steadily increasing expenses pose a headwind, a strong balance sheet, higher rates, reversal in investment banking performance and investment-grade long-term ratings from leading credit rating agencies are likely to continue aiding growth.\n\nWith a market cap of $154 billion, MS is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Its shares have jumped 29.1% in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved 1% upward to $6.84 in the past week.\n\nGoldman: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is a leading global provider of investment banking, securities, investment management and consumer banking services. Based in New York, Goldman has offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other major financial centers globally.\n\nLike Morgan Stanley, the key to the company\u2019s financial stability is its business restructuring efforts. GS intends to refocus its business on its core strengths of IB and trading while scaling back its consumer banking footprint. As part of this effort, in March, the company completed the sale of GreenSky, its home-improvement lending platform. Further, last year, it divested the Personal Financial Management unit.\n\nGoldman also aims to halt unsecured loan offerings to consumers through Marcus. In 2023, it sold substantially all of Marcus\u2019s loan portfolio instalments.\n\nFurther, robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, signs of growing M&A and underwriting pipelines; and global expansion efforts will keep supporting Goldman\u2019s prospects over time.\n\nGoldman has a market cap of $143.1 billion. Over the past six months, the company\u2019s shares have rallied 4.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ongoing-year earnings has been revised almost 1% north to $36.07 in the past seven days.\n\nPiper Sandler: This Zacks Rank #1 company operates as an investment bank and institutional securities firm. The company, based in Minneapolis, MN, offers investment banking and institutional sales, trading and research services. Also, PIPR provides advisory and underwriting services.\n\nThe company has been enhancing its scale and capabilities through strategic buyouts. These have not only diversified its revenue base but also expanded PIPR\u2019s sector coverage, geographical footprint and market share.\n\nThus, through its scaled platform, Piper Sandler has been witnessing robust top-line growth. As the company continues to hire exceptional talent and broadens industry and product coverage, further top-line growth is anticipated despite near-term industry-wide headwinds.\n\nPIPR has a market cap of $3.3 billion. Over the past six months, shares of the company have surged 51%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has remained unchanged at $11.82 over the past week.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Buffett\u2019s Banking Bets: Analyzing the 3 Largest Bank Stocks in Berkshire\u2019s Portfolio",
        "content": "Even before last year\u2019s regional banking crisis, Warren Buffett was bailing on bank stocks. Gone from the portfolio were long-time holdings like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), U.S. Bank (NYSE:USB) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).\n\nHe became disenchanted with the financial institutions and how they operated. He thought they were taking \u201cdumb\u201d risks and were misleading investors by using deceptive accounting tricks to pad their bottom lines. After seeing some red flags in their financial statements, Buffett dumped their shares from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B).\n\nThe subsequent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank seemed to prove just what Buffett was saying.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd yet Buffett didn\u2019t sell all of his bank stocks. In fact, he owns six bank stocks, a few acquired after he dumped many of the old line banks. For example, Nu Holdings (NASDAQ:NU), a new-fangled, all-digital Brazilian banking outfit, was bought in 2021. Recently he acquired stock in five Japanese banks, businesses he says he believes their United States counterparts could learn a lot from.\n\nBelow are three Warren Buffett bank stocks that comprise the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBuffet\u2019s Bank Stocks: Citigroup (C) 2024 investment trends A close-up shot of money printing\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) is performing more like an artificial intelligence stock than a bank stock. Shares of the financial firm are up 63% from the lows hit last October and are running 21% higher in 2024. That vindicates the support Buffett has provided the bank, which assumes almost 1% in his portfolio.\n\nThe bank is undergoing a turnaround that is supercharging the stock. It reported first-quarter results last month that were better than Wall street expected. Revenue rose 1% from last year to $21.1 billion, better than analyst expectations of $20.4 billion. Although profits dropped 28% to $1.58 per share, they were much better than the consensus outlook of $1.20 per share. But Citi has now completed its overhaul that sought to significantly reduce costs, in part by effecting dramatic job cuts. It is also selling off over a dozen retail banking businesses.\n\nBanking was Citi\u2019s top-performing segment in the quarter as revenue jumped 49% on the surprising strength of investment banking and corporate lending. The bank\u2019s return on tangible common equity improved dramatically to 9.9% from 1% last year and a negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter.\n\nBuffett owns 55.2 million shares of Citigroup, or 2.9% of the bank\u2019s outstanding shares.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThought of as mostly as credit card company, American Express (NYSE:AXP) also offers savings accounts and certificates of deposit online. It also has an online bank called American Express National Bank with savings and checking accounts.\n\nAmerican Express is one of Buffett\u2019s oldest holdings, first acquired back in 1991. Remarkably, he has not bought a single share of AmEx since the late 1990s but time and the effects of compounding allowed it to become the fourth biggest position in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio. Buffett owns 151.6 million shares of the financial company or 21.1% of the total outstanding shares. With the stake valued at $35.4 billion, American Express occupies nearly 10% of the portfolio\u2019s total.\n\nAmEx also reported better-than-expected results with net interest income (NII), or the amount of money it earns from customers who keep a balance on their accounts, jumping 26% from last year. Not everyone fears the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve is charging. But by also targeting a younger demographic, American Express is enjoying significant growth. Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said\u00a0 millennials and Gen Z consumers \u201caccounted for over 60 percent of new consumer account acquisitions globally.\u201d\n\nBank of America (BAC) A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe premiere Warren Buffett bank stock is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It was also one of the bank stocks he was buying as the regional banking crisis shook faith in the country\u2019s financial foundations. It took his holdings to over 1 billion shares, or 13.2% of the outstanding total.\n\nAt today\u2019s prices, that stake is valued it at $38.8 billion, only surpassed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $144 billion. As it is, the bank represents 10.7% of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThe financial giant, one of the biggest banks in the country, has also benefited from high interest rates boosting NII. While it also increased unrealized losses, Bank of America should be able to outlast the storm until those assets come to maturity. The stock market appreciates the stability the bank offers as shares have shot 50% higher from their lows and stand 12% above where they started 2024.\n\nThere is no indication Buffett plans to pare his stake in Bank of America as he has been doing with Apple and it will remain a stalwart of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Investment Banks to Buy on Flourishing Industry Prospects",
        "content": "Given the reversal in corporate debt and equity issuances and deal-making activities, the Zacks Investment Bank industry is expected to witness a turnaround in investment banking fees in the quarters ahead.\r\n\r\nAlso, decent client activity in the trading business is expected to continue as uncertainty-induced volatility is likely to persist in the near term. While costs related to technological upgrades might impede bottom-line growth, industry players will eventually witness improved operating efficiency. These factors will keep aiding investment banks like Morgan Stanley MS, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Piper Sandler Companies PIPR.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Investment Bank industry consists of firms that provide financial products and services that include advisory-based financial transactions to corporations, governments and financial institutions worldwide. These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary equity offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Gradually, the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management. Therefore, the industry players work mainly through three product segments \u2014 investment banking (M&As, advisory services and securities underwriting), asset management and trading and principal investments (proprietary and brokerage trading).\n\n3 Themes to Influence the Investment Bank Industry\n\nResurgence in Underwriting and Advisory Businesses: After a sustained weakness in underwriting, IPOs and deal-making activities since 2022 due to geopolitical tensions, global supply-chain disruptions, aggressive monetary policy tightening worldwide to control inflation and potential recession risks, green shoots in advisory and underwriting businesses are visible with the deal pipeline looking healthy.\r\n\r\nWith the macroeconomic environment steadying and the corporates globally adjusting to the high-rate regime, global underwriting and M&A activities are expected to rebound in the coming days. Though the ride will likely be bumpy for investment banks in the near term, the improving operating backdrop will support the industry players\u2019 revenue growth.\r\n\r\nTrading Business Offers Some Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Since 2022, market volatility has significantly increased due to several geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. Though there has been some stability in the macroeconomic backdrop, markets continue to grapple with high global inflation, high interest rates and other geopolitical matters. So, trading volumes will likely remain decent, driven by solid client activities in equity and fixed-income businesses, thereby boosting industry players\u2019 trading income.\r\n\r\nTechnology to Improve Operating Efficiency: Innovative trading platforms, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and investments in technology and advertising are likely to aid the operations of investment banks. The industry players are attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending heavily on technology to help clients with infrastructure development and new platforms. While investment banks will likely face increasing technology-related expenses in the near term, these initiatives are expected to improve operating efficiency over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Investment Bank industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #23, which places it in the top 9% of more than 245 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 34.2% upward.\r\n\r\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to bet on, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Investment Bank industry has underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past year. While stocks in the industry have collectively gained 36.4%, the S&P 500 composite has rallied 26.2% and the Zacks Finance sector has risen 23.7%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry Valuation\n\nOne might get a good sense of the industry\u2019s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), commonly used for valuing investment banks because of significant variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.\r\n\r\nThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.68X, above the median level of 3.31X, over the past five years. The industry is trading at a considerable discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 10.96X and the median level is 10.33X.\n\nPrice-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)\n\nFinance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, so comparing investment banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, comparing the group\u2019s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector\u2019s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 4.79 and the median level of 4.34 for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank industry\u2019s respective ratios.\n\nPrice-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM\n\n3 Investment Banks Worth Investing\n\nMorgan Stanley: This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock operates globally as an investment banking, securities and investment management company. Based in New York, the key source of Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings stability is its business diversification initiatives.  You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley has been undertaking several initiatives aimed at increasing reliable revenue sources. Strategic expansion efforts, including the acquisitions of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks, are in sync with its efforts to focus less on a capital markets-driven revenue mix.\r\n\r\nIn a move that signals their commitment to further collaboration and innovation, last year, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. and Morgan Stanley announced the launch of \"Alliance 2.0\". This will see combined Japanese equity research, sales and execution services for institutional clients at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. Also, their equity underwriting business will be rearranged between the two brokerage units. These efforts will solidify the company\u2019s position in Japan\u2019s market.\r\n\r\nA favorable macroeconomic backdrop is expected to revive its investment banking (IB) business, thereby further strengthening Morgan Stanley\u2019s financials going forward. The demand for both advisory and underwriting businesses will likely rise as corporates realize that higher interest rates are here to stay for a longer period.\r\n\r\nThough steadily increasing expenses pose a headwind, a strong balance sheet, higher rates, reversal in investment banking performance and investment-grade long-term ratings from leading credit rating agencies are likely to continue aiding growth.\r\n\r\nWith a market cap of $154 billion, MS is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Its shares have jumped 29.1% in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved 1% upward to $6.84 in the past week.\n\nPrice and Consensus: MS\n\nGoldman: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is a leading global provider of investment banking, securities, investment management and consumer banking services. Based in New York, Goldman has offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other major financial centers globally.\r\n\r\nLike Morgan Stanley, the key to the company\u2019s financial stability is its business restructuring efforts. GS intends to refocus its business on its core strengths of IB and trading while scaling back its consumer banking footprint. As part of this effort, in March, the company completed the sale of GreenSky, its home-improvement lending platform. Further, last year, it divested the Personal Financial Management unit.\r\n\r\nGoldman also aims to halt unsecured loan offerings to consumers through Marcus. In 2023, it sold substantially all of Marcus\u2019s loan portfolio instalments.\r\n\r\nFurther, robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, signs of growing M&A and underwriting pipelines; and global expansion efforts will keep supporting Goldman\u2019s prospects over time.\r\n\r\nGoldman has a market cap of $143.1 billion. Over the past six months, the company\u2019s shares have rallied 4.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ongoing-year earnings has been revised almost 1% north to $36.07 in the past seven days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: GS\n\nPiper Sandler: This Zacks Rank #1 company operates as an investment bank and institutional securities firm. The company, based in Minneapolis, MN, offers investment banking and institutional sales, trading and research services. Also, PIPR provides advisory and underwriting services.\r\n\r\nThe company has been enhancing its scale and capabilities through strategic buyouts. These have not only diversified its revenue base but also expanded PIPR\u2019s sector coverage, geographical footprint and market share.\r\n\r\nThus, through its scaled platform, Piper Sandler has been witnessing robust top-line growth. As the company continues to hire exceptional talent and broadens industry and product coverage, further top-line growth is anticipated despite near-term industry-wide headwinds.\r\n\r\nPIPR has a market cap of $3.3 billion. Over the past six months, shares of the company have surged 51%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has remained unchanged at $11.82 over the past week.\n\nPrice and Consensus: PIPR\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Bank Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in May",
        "content": "Last year, bank stocks were dragged down by some of the largest bank failures since the Great Recession. However, bank stocks have performed better over the past six months as the Federal Reserve pumped the brakes on its interest rate hiking campaign.\n\nDespite the run-up, there are still appealing long-term investment opportunities in bank stocks that have ridden out challenges in the past few years. Here are three banks that can make solid additions to your portfolio today.\n\n1. Citigroup\n\nCitigroup (NYSE: C) is one of the United States' largest banks, holding nearly $1.7 trillion in assets. But despite its size and scale, it has failed to keep pace with its larger peers. Citigroup's sprawling global business has proven to be a headache, making it difficult to analyze and manage risks. As a result, the bank has underperformed its peers in profitability measures like return on equity (ROE).\n\nIn 2021, Jane Fraser became Citigroup's CEO. Upon assuming the top role, Fraser laid out plans to boost the bank's operating efficiency and profitability. To achieve this, Citigroup announced it would wind down or sell 14 consumer franchises, including its profitable business in Mexico. It would also reduce its workforce and flatten its management structure, eliminating 300 senior management roles. C Price to Tangible Book Value Chart\n\nCitigroup has historically underperformed, which is a big reason why it trades at a 29% discount to its tangible book value. In comparison, peers Bank of America and Wells Fargo trade at a 47% and 62% premium to tangible book value.\n\nCitigroup's restructuring is well underway. In March, it had sold or wound down 9 of its 14 consumer franchises. It also said its Mexico consumer business was on track for a planned initial public offering (IPO) by 2025. Citigroup continues to make progress, and a cheap valuation makes it an appealing opportunity for value-focused investors today.\n\n2. Goldman Sachs\n\nWhen interest rates began rising two years ago, volatile market conditions put a lid on one of the hottest IPO markets ever. The uncertainty around interest rates and the impact on markets had many unicorns putting their IPO plans on hold, resulting in some of the slowest IPO activity in decades.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) plummeted 56% over two years ending in 2023. However, green shoots are emerging, which could be a good sign for Goldman and its investment banking heavy business.\n\nIn the first quarter, Goldman saw its investment banking fees grow 32% from last year, thanks to strong growth across its advisory (mergers and acquisitions), equity underwriting (IPOs), and debt underwriting segments. CEO David Solomon told investors that large IPOs, including Reddit, were well received and showed an increased appetite for risk from investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolomon also sees improving conditions for debt issuance and financing for acquisitions and expects \"solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year.\" With equity and debt underwriting markets improving, Goldman Sachs looks like an excellent value stock to scoop up, trading around 11.8 times its forward earnings for 2024.\n\n3. Charles Schwab\n\nCharles Schwab(NYSE: SCHW) has been a steady long-term performer for investors thanks to its solid return on equity. One key part of its performance is its reliance on low-cost deposits. This has magnified Schwab's strong performance over the past decade and a half, but it has also posed a problem during times of rising interest rates.\n\nBecause Schwab relies heavily on low-cost deposits, its business feels it when those deposits are moved into higher interest-earning assets, which it calls \"client cash sorting.\" Its cash sorting problem was pronounced in 2022 during the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hiking campaign.\n\nFrom August 2022 through April 2023, Schwab's total bank account deposits fell by 32% as clients moved their cash into higher-yielding alternatives. As a result, the company had to tap available lending facilities, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), to ensure it had enough capital and prevent a liquidity problem for the bank.\n\nSchwab is now paying down some of those higher-cost debt arrangements and has seen its deposit outflows slow to a much more manageable pace.\n\nIt should also benefit from falling interest rates. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are pricing\u00a0 three 25-basis-point interest rate cuts over the next year. With the stock priced around 17.1 times its one-year forward earnings, now's a good time to buy Charles Schwab.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Citigroup right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Citigroup, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Citigroup wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Miss Estimates",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.45 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -1.82%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this specialty finance company would post earnings of $0.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.55, delivering a surprise of -3.51%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nGoldman Sachs BDC , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry industry, posted revenues of $111.54 million for the quarter ended March 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.28%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $107.4 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nGoldman Sachs BDC shares have added about 7.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Goldman Sachs BDC?\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs BDC has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Goldman Sachs BDC: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.55 on $114.9 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.18 on $458.25 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry is currently in the bottom 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, PhenixFIN (PFX), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nThis investment firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.79 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nPhenixFIN's revenues are expected to be $5.6 million, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy now. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nIt\u2019s been a dynamic first quarter for the stock market. The S&P 500, one of the leading stock indexes in the world, gained 10.2% in the first three months of 2024, achieving its best first-quarter performance in five years. The impressive performance sparked greater interest among investors in the stock market. In March, investors poured roughly $50 billion into funds focused on purchasing stocks in the US, as reported by EPFR Global Data. That said, it is important to bear in mind that it is the bigger companies that are driving the market upward, especially those that are attentive to the ongoing artificial intelligence wave. The \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s overall gains in the first three months, according to data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Meta\u2019s remarkable returns of over 40% during the period were massively driven by the company\u2019s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year.\n\nDividends play an important role in the investment landscape, with approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 paying dividends to shareholders. However, consistently increasing payouts is a challenging feat. In fact, just 13% of the companies in the index are included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, an elite group that tracks the performance of companies growing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors also favor dividend growth stocks due to their strong performance over the years, particularly during periods of high interest rates. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited Abrdn\u2019s data and reported that from December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a compounded return of 10.68%, compared with a 2.70% return of dividend cutters and eliminators. We also mentioned that non-dividend payers also underperformed dividend growers during this period, returning 9.25%. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the best dividend stocks that have consistently raised their dividends over the years.\n\nThe combination of dividend growth and high yields presents investors with strong investment opportunities. S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for five consecutive years with an average dividend yield of 3%, has delivered an annualized return of 11.94% from 2010 to 2022, according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The report also mentioned that during this period, the index grew its dividend at an annual average rate of 13.8%, exceeding the US long-term inflation rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the S&P 500. 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the S&P 500 companies and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields above 2%, as of May 7. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 hedge funds, as of Q4 2023.

        "content": "(Adds background on Kaplan's time at the Federal Reserve in paragraphs 4-5)\n\nBy Saeed Azhar\n\nNEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday it had appointed Robert Kaplan, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, as its vice chairman, adding an influential former policymaker and Goldman alumni to its management committee.\n\nKaplan will give strategic advice to the Wall Street giant's clients globally, working closely with its teams across global banking and markets, and asset and wealth management, the bank said in a statement.\n\nKaplan, who had earlier spent more than two decades at Goldman Sachs, \"brings a wealth of knowledge, deep relationships and significant global leadership expertise to his role as vice chairman,\" Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement.\n\nKaplan, 66, will be based in Dallas. He announced in September 2021 that he would step down as head of the Dallas Fed amid a controversy over his personal trading activity. Kaplan has said he adhered to all Fed ethical standards, compliance rules and policies.\n\nIn January, the Fed's internal watchdog said Kaplan did not break the law but created the appearance of a conflict of interest in how he invested and reported his financial activity from 2019 to 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs last year brought back into the fold senior banking executive Tom Montag, adding him to its board as it looked to regain lost ground after an ill-fated foray into consumer banking.\n\nThe bank is replenishing its bench of heavy-hitters after recent high-profile departures including Stephanie Cohen, who had headed its consumer and fintech unit, Jim Esposito, co-head of global banking and markets, and former asset management executive Julian Salisbury.\n\nKaplan said in a statement he looked forward to working with the \"extraordinary array of talented people\" across the firm to serve its clients and help enhance and sustain its unique culture.\n\nKaplan initially joined Goldman Sachs in 1983 and became a partner in 1990. He retired from the firm in 2006 to join Harvard Business School and later served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from 2015 to 2021.

        "title": "Earnings Beat: The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Models",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) just released its latest first-quarter results and things are looking bullish. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 9.9% to hit US$14b. Goldman Sachs Group also reported a statutory profit of US$11.58, which was an impressive 33% above what the analysts had forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nView our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Goldman Sachs Group from 18 analysts is for revenues of US$51.2b in 2024. If met, it would imply a decent 9.6% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 45% to US$37.05. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$51.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$36.78 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$449. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Goldman Sachs Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$517 and the most bearish at US$360 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Goldman Sachs Group shareholders.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 13% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 6.1% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.7% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Goldman Sachs Group to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Goldman Sachs Group. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

        "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday formally ended the U.S. government's criminal case against Goldman Sachs related to the Wall Street bank's work for the Malaysian fund 1MDB after it met its obligations and paid $2.9 billion in penalties.\n\nChief Judge Margo Brodie of the federal court in Brooklyn dismissed a bribery conspiracy charge against Goldman, after the bank successfully completed a three-year deferred prosecution agreement that expired in October.\n\nGoldman did not oppose the dropping of the criminal charge.\n\nThe bank helped sell $6.5 billion of bonds for 1MDB, which former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up with the help of Malaysian financier Jho Low to promote economic development.\n\nU.S. and Malaysian authorities have said $4.5 billion was siphoned away, with some diverted to offshore bank accounts and shell companies linked to Low, who is now a fugitive.\n\nGoldman has said 1MDB officials and former Malaysian government officials lied to it about how bond sale proceeds would be used.\n\nThe bank collected about $600 million in fees, and its Malaysia unit pleaded guilty to a corruption charge.\n\nTwo former Goldman bankers were criminally charged in the matter.\n\nTim Leissner, who led Goldman's Southeast Asia business, pleaded guilty and has yet to be sentenced.\n\nRoger Ng, a former head of investment banking in Malaysia, was convicted in Brooklyn and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but transported to Malaysia last October to assist probes there.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When Goldman Sachs Group Inc. went public 25 years ago in one of the biggest US initial public offerings up to that point, the poster child of Wall Street had been largely owned by partners for more than a century.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTruce Talks Drag as Hamas Hits Israel Crossing in Deadly Attack Judge Threatens Trump With Jail Over Gag Order Violations At $2 Million Per Minute, Treasuries Mint Cash Like Never Before Treasury Rally Risks Running Into a $125 Billion Brick Wall Buffett Praises Apple After Trimming It, Drops Paramount Stake\n\nSince then, Goldman has gone through multiple changes \u2014 in CEOs, offices and more \u2014 though it remains one of the largest and most successful bastions of the industry. Goldman\u2019s stock has been hitting new highs lately, closing at $438.18 on Friday, up 14% for the year and more than 8 times the $53 it sold shares at in May 1999. Its shares have outperformed rivals during its era as a public company, even if the bank has seen its share of twists and turns.\n\n\u201cBack then it was the dominant firm,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, who followed Goldman\u2019s IPO as a senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp. at the time. \u201cIt was a partnership \u2014 they made aggressive bets and more often than not they were successful.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for the firm. Goldman went public during a heyday for Wall Street amid the dot-com bubble. A decade later, shares tumbled as the confidence was rattled in the US financial system. Goldman was one of several banks that accepted government support in 2008 that helped stabilize the financial system. It also restructured itself into a bank holding company, as did chief rival Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe IPO, which hewed off a 15% stake of the firm, helped make many people rich. Today, partners own a much smaller portion of Goldman shares. When the bank went public a quarter-century ago, it had less than 14,000 employees and net revenue of about $13 billion. Its workforce now totals more than 44,000 people, who produced more than $46 billion of net revenue in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about how much has changed since then, what\u2019s remarkable is how much has stayed constant: our core values, our partnership ethos, and the caliber of our people,\u201d Chief Executive Officer David Solomon wrote in a post on LinkedIn about the anniversary.\n\nGoldman\u2019s recent advance has come alongside management\u2019s decision to back away from consumer lending, which had been a key push under Solomon. Solomon is the third CEO since Goldman went public, following Lloyd Blankfein who handed over the reins in 2018. His predecessor, Henry Paulson, took the company public in 1999 and left to become US Treasury Secretary in 2006.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs has been around since 1869, when an immigrant from Germany opened an office in lower Manhattan. These days, Goldman\u2019s New York employees work in a modern building at 200 West Street in Manhattan that opened in 2009 and is a sharp contrast to the old, granite tower that was the bank\u2019s headquarters at 85 Broad Street for decades before then.\n\n\u201cGoldman was the big 800-pound gorilla, partnership that decided to go public, so it was a big event,\u201d said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr, who has been covering Wall Street banks for decades. Goldman\u2019s first trading day, after being one of the last of its peers to go public, saw a 33% pop.\n\nThe stock\u2019s recent advance has a lot to do with the optimism about a rebound for capital markets activity, said the analyst.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would not bet against Goldman Sachs getting more than their fair share of this recovery that people think is about to happen in capital markets,\u201d said Schorr.\n\n--With assistance from Sridhar Natarajan and Bailey Lipschultz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChris Dixon\u2019s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto\u2019s Grifty Reputation The State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong Why Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring AI Is Helping Automate One of the World\u2019s Most Gruesome Jobs Will GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Goldman Sachs (GS), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Goldman Sachs currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for GS that show why this investment bank shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor GS, shares are up 2.48% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry is up 0.87% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.38% compares favorably with the industry's 1.63% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Goldman Sachs have risen 14.03%, and are up 33.99% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 3.78% and 27.1%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also take note of GS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, GS is averaging 2,635,439 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with GS.\n\nOver the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost GS's consensus estimate, increasing from $32.86 to $36.07 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that GS is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Goldman Sachs on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Soft economic landing achieved, says one of the most influential voices in the markets.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve had a soft landing,\u201d Apollo Global Management (APO) CEO Marc Rowan told Yahoo Finance Live at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday. \u201cWill it continue? I think so.\u201d\n\nA soft landing for the economy is loosely defined as growth continuing \u2014 and recession averted \u2014 amid a series of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nAlthough markets have had mixed response to economic as data of late, with investors debating the outlook for interest rates, the raw numbers underscore Rowan's views.\n\nThe US economy expanded by 1.6% in the first quarter, the slowest pace in nearly two years \u2014 but it's still growing instead of contracting. The economy advanced by a 3.4% annualized rate in the final quarter of 2024.\n\nGDP growth for 2023 tallied a 2.5% annualized pace, defying calls for a mild recession at the start of the year by several Wall Street firms.\n\n\"When rates have gone up 400 basis points and the wheels haven't come off the bus, as they say I think that's the definition of a soft landing,\" Rowan added.\n\nSigns of a healthye economy showed up in Apollo's first quarter earnings.\n\nTotal assets under management (AUM) rose 12% year over year to $671 billion, benefiting from $40 billion in inflows.\n\nThe company saw record quarterly debt origination volume of $40 billion.\n\nAsset management fees in the asset management segment rose 13%, driven by demand for retirement services.\n\nApollo shares are up 22% year to date, out-performing the S&P 500's 9% gain.\n\nApollo Global Management is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Goldman (GS) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Goldman Sachs (GS) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nGoldman currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.48, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.48 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 73.9% and 4.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GS Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GS\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Goldman here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Goldman, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs GS a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Goldman, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 10.4% over the past month to $36.07.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Goldman. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Goldman may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This article looks at the 15 best places to retire in West Virginia. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of Home Equity and Retirement in West Virginia, please proceed to 5 Best Places to Retire in West Virginia.\n\nCapitalizing on Home Equity\n\nAn important reason many Americans fail to accumulate any savings for their retirement is competing life priorities. Research from The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) has found that competing life priorities can reduce an average worker\u2019s retirement savings by up to 37%. These life priorities can emerge in the shape of a range of different expenses and ailments, such as inflationary pressures, a high mortgage, or unforeseen medical expenses. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) estimates that factors such as student loans can reduce retirement savings by 19%. As Americans struggle to divert any significant income towards their retirement nest eggs, their likelihood of securing a comfortable retirement becomes questionable.\n\nHowever, one crucial factor that many potential retirees fail to capitalize on is their home equity. Home equity is the difference between the value of an individual\u2019s home and their outstanding mortgage, which essentially represents what you own in a home. More importantly, however, home equity is recognized as an asset, against which homeowners can draw out loans to meet pressing financial needs.\n\nAccording to Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC), homeowner equity surged to 69.6% in 2023 which is the highest it has been since the 1980s (except for Q2-2022). In a research note published in August 2023, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) economists revealed that appreciation in home prices could help fuel the next leg of consumer spending.\n\n\"Strong home price appreciation in the years following the pandemic may be an underappreciated tailwind for the household sector. The total value of the U.S. single-family market breached $40 trillion last year, and the mix between debt and equity has shifted over time with the portion held by homeowners in the form of equity trending higher since about 2012.\"\n\n-Economists Tim Quinlan & Shannon Seery, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC)\n\nSimilarly, a 2023 survey by The Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) showed that 83% of respondents believed their home equity had increased within the prior year. Among those aware of their home equity, 57% estimated they have $100,000 or more in home equity, per The Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD). There are several advantages to borrowing against home equity, the most vital of which is that home equity loans tend to have lower interest rates in comparison to uncollateralized loans. Similarly, a Home Equity Line of Credit, or HELOC, can be used to obtain a revolving credit line at cheaper interest rates in comparison to personal loans and credit cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Finance of America Companies Inc. (NYSE: FOA) announced the expanded launch of its HomeSafe Second Loan initiative. Under this program, Finance of America Companies Inc. (NYSE: FOA) offers homeowners aged 55 years or older access to their home equity without adding new monthly payments or changing the existing rate on their primary mortgage.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s market conditions are uniquely challenging, and innovative financing is needed to fill gaps between consumers and traditional loan products\u2026.. We\u2019re proud to address that gap with HomeSafe Second and help retirees and pre-retirees access the wealth tied up in their equity without adding a new monthly mortgage payment to their cash obligations.\u201d\n\n-Kristen Sieffert, President, Finance of America Companies Inc. (NYSE: FOA)\n\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) reports that in its survey of homeowners who planned on renovating in the next two years, 38% planned on using either a HELOC or a Home Equity Loan to finance their renovation. Moreover, many of these homeowners are investing in these renovations with the intent of selling, optimistic that the renovations would help them appreciate their home values. This highlights that home equity isn\u2019t just a powerful tool to combat what The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) describes as a \u201cFinancial Vortex of Competing Life Priorities\u201d but can also be used to build up your retirement nest egg.\n\nThus, while retirement continues to be a concern for all generations, there are plenty of different strategies you can utilize to save for retirement. One common strategy for retirement is to relocate across state borders. The best states for retirement tend to be the ones that can provide you with the right combination of comfort and affordability. For those keen on a retirement in the South, there are plenty of cities in Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida that can be considered as the best places to retire in. In addition, the state of West Virginia features some of the best places to retire in the south as well.\n\nPros and Cons of Retiring in West Virginia\n\nThere are many reasons for retirees to consider spending their golden years in the Mountain State. With a cost of living 12.3% below the US average, West Virginia is one of the best states in the US to retire financially. According to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z), based on listings posted on their platform, West Virginia has an average home price of $161,063. This is significantly lower than the current national average which, according to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z), is $354,179. West Virginia is also considered to be quite tax-friendly. Property and sales tax burdens in the state are relatively low.\n\nOn the other hand, West Virginia is one of the states that still taxes social security. However, the state is in the process of phasing out its Social Security tax, having recently signed a bill that will exempt all retirees from Social Security taxes by tax year 2026. Currently, all single filers with income under $50,000 and couples earning under $100,000 are eligible for a Social Security tax exemption.\n\nWith these factors considered, if you are still contemplating whether West Virginia is a good retirement state, join us as we look at the best places to retire in West Virginia. 15 Best Places to Retire in West Virginia\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in West Virginia\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of best places to retire in West Virginia, we initially picked out the most recommended best places to retire in West Virginia on the internet.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley\u2019s Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we'll look into Morgan Stanley's top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Morgan Stanley's\u00a0Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nWith the upcoming U.S. election season looming, the Federal Reserve has attempted to chart a course of interest rate cuts, banking on the assumption that inflation will eventually be reined in. However, despite this, both economic growth and the labor market have displayed resilience. Recent economic indicators have prompted Morgan Stanley Research to revise its forecast for U.S. economic growth, now projecting 2.3% for 2024 and 2.1% for 2025, up from previous estimates of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Consequently, the Fed is expected to initiate the first rate cut of this cycle in July, instead of the previously anticipated June, followed by two more 25 basis point cuts by year-end. Looking ahead to 2025, Morgan Stanley anticipates a continued downward trend in rates, with the Fed making cuts at each meeting through June, aiming to reach a rate of 3.625%.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 marked Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick's inaugural term, with his background in investment banking and trading standing in contrast to his predecessor James Gorman's focus on wealth management. Pick's tenure began on a challenging note, with the bank facing headwinds from high-interest rates prompting wealth management clients to shift funds into higher-yielding securities. By April 16, the bank's shares had declined by nearly 7% for the year. However, similar to its competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley benefitted from robust trading and investment banking performance in Q1. Pick, emphasizing the vital role of dealmaking as an \"existential reality\" for companies, signaled a potential catalyst for Wall Street's awaited recovery in investment banking. While Morgan Stanley's resurgence in investment banking trailed some of its competitors\u2014Goldman Sachs saw a 32% increase in fees\u2014Pick remained optimistic.\n\n\"I\u2019m feeling good about this being early-to-mid cycle for the classic investment banking, capital markets business around the world,\" said Pick, who succeeded long-serving chief James Gorman in January.\n\nSee also: Goldman Sachs\u2019 Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nThe results underscored the prowess of Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm, which has been pivotal in driving the bank's growth in recent years, particularly evident in its ability to attract significant new client assets. This led to the bank's first-quarter profits surging by 14% year-over-year to $3.41 billion, or $2.02 per share, with each of its three main divisions contributing to the growth, while revenue increased by 4% to $15.14 billion. Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% to $6.88 billion, surpassing estimates by $230 million, driven by market gains boosting fee revenue despite a decrease in interest income. At the same time, fixed-income trading revenue dipped by 3.5% to $2.49 billion but still beat expectations by $120 million. Investment banking revenue surged by 16% to $1.45 billion, slightly surpassing the $1.40 billion estimate, driven by higher debt and equity issuance, offsetting lower acquisition fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking more on its outlook for the future, this is what the bank's management had to say during the first quarter 2024 earnings call:\n\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels.\n\nWe continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice in delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time.

(NASDAQ:BIIB) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe started a position in Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) during the quarter, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on multiple sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and most recently Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The company has been on a roller coast since the approval of Aduhelm, for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in June 2021. At the time, the approval was highly criticized given the limited efficacy of the treatment. Following the fallout, the company stands today with a new highly regarded CEO, Christopher Viehbacher, a more efficacious approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatment in Leqembi, a rationalized cost structure and a more disciplined investment approach. While the uptake in Leqembi has been slow, we still see strong long-term potential for a patient population that is dramatically underserved. We believe you are getting the opportunity to buy a high performing health care asset, with a strong track record of delivering superior products all while only paying for the current value of their assets on the market today. At the current valuation, we think you are getting a call option on the pipeline and the Leqembi roll-out. It is not often that you see this sort of risk/reward skew in the market, and we opportunistically took advantage.\u201d\n\n6. Nu Holdings Ltd.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 best financial sector dividend stocks to invest in. You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\n\n2023 didn\u2019t start out very rosy for the financial sector, marked by the sudden collapses of notable regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.\n\nThat said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn\u2019t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates.\n\nMany financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo discussed the outlooked with Bloomberg and said:\n\n\u201cThere are a number of factors that can impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior, to name just a few. All of which we have little to no control over.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, some of the biggest banks such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) have been crystal ball gazing and predicting declines in their net interest income(NII) for 2024. On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders. In fact, if we look at the recent data, we get to know that nearly half of the global increases in dividend payouts in 2023 originated from banks, exceeding their share in the total dividend payments, which is one-sixth, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The report also mentioned that the significant 15% rise, reaching a record $220 billion, primarily came from banks\u2019 improved profitability due to the normalization of interest rates following years of loose monetary policies. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the financial sector. 14 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. From the resultant list, we picked 14 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment towards them. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nIn addition to covering topics like the best dividend stocks to buy, at Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea.

The firm's diversified service offerings, spanning investment banking, trading, asset management, and wealth management, contribute to a resilient revenue stream.

This global reach and brand equity are vital assets that differentiate GS from its competitors.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny and Legal Challenges: GS operates in a highly regulated environment, and the firm is subject to ongoing investigations and reviews by various governmental and regulatory bodies. These include inquiries into trading practices, compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), hiring and compensation practices, and risk management controls. Such scrutiny can lead to legal and financial repercussions, impacting the firm's reputation and operational freedom.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperational Risks and Market Dependence: The firm's operational complexity and dependence on market conditions expose it to risks that could affect its performance. Market volatility, credit risks, and interest rate fluctuations can influence GS's trading and investment banking activities.

Its global presence and brand reputation are key strengths that underpin its market leadership. However, regulatory challenges and operational risks present areas for improvement.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The world\u2019s biggest bond market is back in celebration mode after its worst month in more than a year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel Online Apple Rallies Most in 18 Months on Upbeat Forecast, Buyback Everything Apple Plans to Show at May 7 \u2018Let Loose\u2019 iPad Event Trump Auditions VP Picks Before Wealthy Donors in Palm Beach Turkey Confirms All Trade Halt With Israel Over War in Gaza\n\nEvidence that the US labor market is finally softening in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate increases revived bets that the central bank will begin lowering rates by the end of the year. That enabled the bond market to extend a rally that began Wednesday after supportive comments by Fed boss Jerome Powell.\n\nWhile the gains faded somewhat ahead of next week\u2019s Treasury note and bond auctions, yields remain lower for a third straight day. The two-year note\u2019s yield has fallen more than 20 basis points since Tuesday, its biggest decline over a three-day period since January.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s jobs report, though it wasn\u2019t a disaster, further confirmed to the Fed that monetary policy is restrictive,\u201d said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cAll of this keeps the cuts narrative alive, and it\u2019s positive for both Treasuries and risk assets. There\u2019s room for rates to fall further, and if the next consumer price report shows moderation, then this thing is really going to run.\u201d\n\nThe US consumer price index for April is slated to be released on May 15.\n\nThe bond market has been punished for most of this year by inflation readings that failed to moderate as much as the Fed expected. Yields reached their highest levels of the year in the past two weeks on indications that economic growth also remains robust.\n\nExpectations for Fed rate cuts \u2014 which traders at the start of the year wagered would total at least 150 basis points \u2014 dwindled nearly to a single, 25-basis-point cut, and not until December.\n\nThe US government\u2019s April employment report brought a reprieve. Job creation slowed to 175,000, the smallest gain in six months, the unemployment unexpectedly rose to 3.9% and wage gains slowed.\n\nIn response, derivative traders resumed mostly pricing in a Fed rate cut in September and two quarter-point moves this year. The two-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, more sensitive than longer maturities to changes in the Fed\u2019s rate, fell as much as 17 basis points to 4.71% before rebounding to around 4.81%. It peaked at 5.04% this week.\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Friday that additional reports like April\u2019s would give him comfort the economy isn\u2019t overheating despite inflation having \u201chit a bump\u201d early this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBonds\u2019 recovery began after Powell in the news conference after the Fed\u2019s most recent policy meeting downplayed the chances that the central bank would resume raising rates.\n\nThe market-implied odds of another rate increase had risen slightly after March consumer price index data were released April 10. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers at that point said there was risk the Fed\u2019s next move would be a hike, and interest-rate options began to reflect a non-zero chance of a hike, according to Bloomberg Intelligence chief US interest-rate strategist Ira Jersey.\n\nTreasury yield of all maturities remain at least six basis points lower on the day, some near the lowest levels since mid-April. The market\u2019s 2.3% loss in April, as measured by the Bloomberg Treasury Index, was its biggest in more than a year.\n\nFriday\u2019s rally may have been aided by investors scrapping positions that anticipated yields would continue to rise, in addition to the establishment of new positions predicated on further yield declines. Transactions included several large block trades in short-term interest rate futures, used by traders to wager on the outlook for Fed policy.\n\nThe jobs data \u201cshould be perceived by markets as a welcome breath of fresh air as it will hush the hawkish undertone in the market and any recent stagflation fears,\u201d said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, co-CIO of multi asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \u201cWe continue to look through the debate around timing of cuts to the fact that the data, in aggregate and observed over a longer time period, will drive a non-recessionary cutting cycle. This should be positive for risk assets and bonds.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 index was up more than 1% as investors saw an economy still strong enough to support earnings as well as prospects that lower rates would also work as a tailwind ahead.\n\nRead more: Extreme Bond Market Shorts Gamble on a Hawkish Powell Pivot\n\nUS interest-rate volatility remains elevated and is expected to remain high as each new piece of economic data has the potential to alter expectations for Fed policy. Swaps traders this year have priced in as many as six and as few as one quarter-point Fed cuts in 2024.\n\nThe ICE BofA MOVE Index \u2014 a gauge of bond volatility that tracks anticipated swings in Treasury yields based on options \u2014 has averaged about 106 so far this year versus 77 over the past decade.\n\n\u201cThe April payroll report was unambiguously positive for the rates market,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US interest rates strategy at TD Securities. \u201cIt plays right into Powell\u2019s pushback on rate hike expectations, which suggested the market was getting ahead of itself on hawkishness. But the market will continue to lurch from data point to data point as investors refine the odds of cuts in 2024.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Edward Bolingbroke.\n\n(Adds additional context and updates yield levels.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Is Helping Automate One of the World\u2019s Most Gruesome Jobs Will GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "3 Undervalued Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever for 6X Gains",
        "content": "Beaten-down stocks can be the best friend of those with the patience to hold through ups and downs.\u00a0Well-established companies that have products with staying power will\u00a0rarely disappoint\u00a0you over a multi-year investment period.\u00a0Wall Street often takes things too far when a business faces bearish pressure. However, the opposite is also true. It is always better to pounce on the former opportunity \u2013 buying undervalued stocks is a more fruitful endeavor than shorting overvalued ones.\n\nThe good thing about buying undervalued stocks compared to shorting overvalued stocks is that time is on your side. As the broader market and economy grow, so will these well-established companies.\u00a0As the\u00a0old Wall Street adage goes, \u201cThe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\u201d\n\nMoreover, we had quite a dovish Jerome Powell, at least according to Dudley. The Federal Reserve Chairman\u2019s stance seemed clear on there being no more rate hikes\u00a0going forward.\u00a0Even if inflation comes in hot, the Fed is likely to\u00a0simply\u00a0hold steady.\u00a0He also indicated that the Fed would still cut rates even if wage growth remained high. All of this dovish monetary policy stance makes me optimistic about the following three undervalued stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.\n\nSource: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) had\u00a0a very bad month. The stock is down 31% over this past month and\u00a0is down\u00a013% since just Thursday.\u00a0The semiconductor industry, in general,\u00a0hasn\u2019t\u00a0been keeping up\u00a0very well.\u00a0Momentum seems to have faded, and many big-name semiconductor stocks have come crashing down.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nIntel\u2019s sustained turnaround has\u00a0been entirely reversed\u00a0in just one month after\u00a0the release of its first-quarter earnings, which revealed revenue of $12.72 billion, an increase of 8.8% year-over-year, but still a 0.44% miss.\u00a0Moreover, the company\u2019s second-quarter revenue outlook fell short of estimates. A month before that, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso reiterated an \u201cunderperform\u201d rating and a $31.00 price target for Intel. Susquehanna lowered its price target for Intel to $40 from $42. Citi also cut its price target for Intel, but opened a \u201cpositive catalyst watch.\u201d\n\nDespite all the bearishness,\u00a0I think\u00a0INTC stock is an excellent long-term play.\u00a0As the\u00a0old\u00a0adage goes, \u201cbe greedy when others are fearful.\u201d\u00a0The business\u00a0was declining\u00a0badly just two years back, and\u00a0now\u00a0sales growth has turned solidly positive.\u00a0Expectations were\u00a0certainly\u00a0higher than they should have been due to recent AI mania and the market rally. But even with the miss, you cannot argue that Intel is in worse shape than it was during the 2022 selloff. As such, prices\u00a0coming back down\u00a0to those levels seem like a bargain to me.\n\nStory continues\n\nLightspeed Commerce (LSPD) a pile of credit cards, credit card interest rates\n\nSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.com\n\nLightspeed Commerce (NYSE:LSPD) provides point-of-sale and e-commerce software to retail businesses. This stock has been one of the most bearish names in the market. Indeed, LSPD stock has been depressed since the company\u2019s late-2021 selloff, and is up just 5% over the past year.\n\nHowever, I have high hopes for Lightspeed Commerce.\u00a0Not everyone would agree\u00a0that it is one of the most undervalued stocks, but\u00a0I\u00a0believe\u00a0taking a contrarian view is not a bad idea at all here, especially after the return of Dax Dasilva as CEO.\u00a0The company recently announced cost reductions, a share repurchase program, and\u00a0a reaffirmation of\u00a0its focus on profitable growth. Lightspeed is now undergoing a shift of focus to its payment solutions.\n\nRegardless, institutional investors are yet to be impressed, as LSPD stock has faced\u00a0a slew of\u00a0price target cuts. I\u00a0personally\u00a0remain bullish on this company, as the stock price has an established floor and lots of upside potential if management manages to outperform. Analysts expect earnings per share to rise from 16 cents to $1.14 from 2024 to 2028,\u00a0along\u00a0with revenue growing almost 300% in the next six years.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0I think\u00a0paying the premium here is worth it.\n\nStoneCo (STNE) a credit card reader with a credit card in it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE) is in almost the same boat as Lightspeed Commerce regarding stock price performance. STNE stock has been rangebound around $10 to $20 for the last two years, though it is up over 30% in the past year.\u00a0I think\u00a0this upside trend could continue as its financial technology and software solutions become\u00a0more popular\u00a0in Brazil.\n\nBrazil was one of the least-penetrated regions in\u00a0terms of\u00a0online banking, fintech, and e-commerce just a few years back, but it has become one of the biggest markets for companies like StoneCo. We are now seeing significant growth, with StoneCo\u2019s 3-year revenue growth rate at 51%, better than 93.4% of its software peers. Moreover, it has maintained a net margin of 14%.\u00a0Margins have lagged sales growth, but\u00a0I think\u00a0this could be a catalyst that drives shares back up significantly once margins expand.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nYou\u2019re paying just over 11-times forward earnings for all the growth here, which makes this one of the most undervalued stocks in the fintech space. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded StoneCo to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d and raised its price target to $21 from $12 in January, which has been correct thus far. I believe STNE stock changing hands at $35 or higher could be in the cards by next year, barring any significant downturn.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has removed the cap on bonuses for its top bankers in the UK, according to a source familiar with the matter, months after the country axed the policy it had inherited from the European Union.\n\nThe cap sprung from a 2014 move by the EU, which the UK exited six years later, to try to deter bankers from the kind of excessive risk-taking that was blamed for the global financial crisis of 2008.\n\nIt limited bonuses to twice the basic pay if shareholders approved. However, banks often had to bump up the fixed salaries to circumvent the cap.\n\nGoldman's move would help it change the way it compensates its \"material risk takers\", a class of employees whose performance can have a big impact on the bank, the source said, requesting anonymity as the details are confidential.\n\n\"This approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance,\" a Goldman spokesperson said.\n\n\"It brings the UK closer to the practice in other global financial centers, to support the UK as an attractive venue for talent.\"\n\n(Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru and Saeed Azhar in New York; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Trending Stock The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $8.67 per share, indicating a change of +181.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $35.86 points to a change of +56.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +9.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $38.78 indicates a change of +8.2% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Goldman is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.64 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.1%. The $51.28 billion and $53.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.9% and +3.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.26%. The EPS surprise was +35.6%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGoldman is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz makes political news in Washington, D.C., but he\u2019s also a prodigious investor, so wise investors watch his stocks.\n\nHowever, Ted Cruz\u2019s stocks reveal the conservative senator\u2019s taste. His portfolio is dominated by oil and gas equities, which isn\u2019t unexpected given his policies.\n\nCruz rejects political intervention in oil and gas mergers and prioritizes facts above anti-fossil fuel sentiment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHe wants to eliminate the Biden administration\u2019s proposed gas heater efficiency requirements, which would compel homeowners and small businesses to undertake costly heating system upgrades.\u200b\n\nCruz also proposed the Energy Freedom Act to speed up federal energy project permits, oil and gas lease sales, and LNG export licenses. He strongly supports the Keystone XL pipeline and criticizes the Paris Agreement.\n\nHe picks stocks similar to his policy views, except when selling shares of a certain banking giant, which might seem strange. The pieces will fit together once you know how much he loves a certain digital treasure.\n\nLet\u2019s look into it more!\n\nGoldman Sachs Group (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating on Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) stock. The consensus price target for the next 12 months is $452.32, which means that the last selling price of $403.11 could increase by 12%. However, regarding his stocks, Ted Cruz is not a fan of GS.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz engaged in stock trading in 2024, especially with transactions involving The Goldman Sachs Group. Interestingly, he sold shares in this business for $250,000 to $500,000 in mid-April.\n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs is doing well on its own. Net sales were $46.25 billion for the year and $11.32 billion for Q4. Net income was $8.52 billion for the year and $2.01 billion for Q4. The corporation streamlined its 2024 approach to serve customers effectively, run lasting enterprises, and scale operations.\u200b The super performance continued in Q1\u201924 results, with an EPS beat of 33%, thanks to $11.58 EPS on around $14 billion in revenue.\n\nPerhaps the issue is a bit deeper. In the past, Cruz has spoken glowingly about Bitcoin (BTC-USD); he owns the digital asset and is \u201cincredibly bullish on Bitcoin.\u201d However, Goldman Sachs doesn\u2019t share in the enthusiasm. \u201cWe\u2019re not believers in crypto,\u201d the chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Wealth Management unit has said. Perhaps this is why Cruz sold off his shares; regardless, it\u2019s an important move.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nEnterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD) EPS for Q4 \u201923 was 72 cents, more than 5% higher than the expected 68 cents. This is exactly the kind of return Ted Cruz will want from energy plays. Moving onto revenue, $14.62 billion beat, by 19%, the Wall Street expectations of $12.28 billion.\n\nThe corporation stated it will invest in energy initiatives that suit U.S. and global demands. These include new building projects and pipe and storage facility upgrades to boost efficiency and capacity. To expand its operations in the Permian Basin, the firm plans to construct a new natural gas processing facility in Texas. It will process natural gas better.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners said it would give $0.515 per unit in cash every three months for the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to a 7% yield and 79%; head and shoulders above the industry average. The distribution has grown by over 5% since the fourth quarter of 2022 and 3% since the third quarter of 2023. Enterprise also bought back $96 million worth of common units in the fourth quarter of 2023, using 46% of its allowed $2.0 billion buyback program.\u200b\n\nCompared to other Ted Cruz stocks, it has a strong buy rating and substantial upside potential of around 16%.\n\nOneok (OKE) Oneok company logo icon on website\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOneok (NYSE:OKE), a Texas company that focuses on natural gas but has many other businesses, had a good year in 2023. Net income rose to $2.7 billion for the year, or $1.18 per common share. It grew to $688 million in the fourth quarter, or $1.18 per share.\n\nDuring the year, operating efficiency increased 20% in the Rocky Mountain NGL raw feed flow and 17% in the Gulf Coast/Permian, resulting in 54% more wells.\n\nIn 2024, ONEOK thinks it will have a net income of $2.8 billion and an adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 billion. The Saguaro Connector Pipeline growth project and the Elk Creek Pipeline expansion project will cost the company between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion to build out.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, ONEOK bought Magellan to help NGL grow. That will pay dividends in the forthcoming quarters.\n\nThe $2 billion share purchase shows that ONEOK is financially stable and dedicated to shareholder returns.

        "title": "Why Goldman Sachs (GS) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now",
        "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nGoldman Sachs in Focus\n\nHeadquartered in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 10.84% so far this year. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $2.75 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.57%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.52% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.58%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $11 is up 4.8% from last year. Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 26.83%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Goldman's payout ratio is 43%, which means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nLooking at this fiscal year, GS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $35.86 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 56.80%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\n\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that GS is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we'll take a look into Goldman Sachs' top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nEstablished in 1869 by German immigrant Marcus Goldman, Goldman Sachs has evolved into the world's second-largest investment bank by revenue, amassing $1.65 billion in fees during the first quarter of 2024. From its modest origins in a one-room basement office adjacent to a coal chute, the bank has expanded steadily over the years. In 1906, it made its mark in the initial public offering (IPO) market with the iconic Sears, Roebuck, & Co. Goldman Sachs was among the pioneers in emphasizing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over book values for company valuation.\n\nBanks are intricately linked to the fluctuations in interest rates due to their core function of dealing with money. While consumers may lament higher rates, banks often welcome them as they can widen their profit margins, known as the 'spread,' even amidst reduced borrowing demand during tighter monetary conditions. However, higher interest rates can challenge banks to manage their asset base, including funds invested in securities like bonds. Sharp rate fluctuations necessitate the revaluation of these securities, potentially resulting in losses that could jeopardize the stability of even the most profitable of banks. This was evident in the US banking crisis of 2023, particularly impacting Goldman Sachs, which reported a substantial $470 million loss in its loan portfolio during the first quarter of that year. This loss was part of the bank's efforts to restructure its retail banking division in response to the challenging environment.\n\nDespite grappling with such challenges a year ago as it ventured into Main Street endeavors, Goldman Sachs came back strong by refocusing on its core strengths. In the first quarter of this year, it surpassed analyst expectations by nearly $1 billion, garnering close to $4 billion in earnings, largely driven by substantial profits in its trading and corporate advisory divisions. While analysts anticipated a turnaround in deal-making activities, Goldman Sachs exceeded this forecast. Notably, the bank's investment banking fees soared by an impressive 32% in the latest results, reaching $2.08 billion. Additionally, the consumer banking division reported a noteworthy 24% revenue growth, marking a refreshing change after years of costly losses and write-downs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the investment bank's surge in revenues, its net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters were a mere $23 million for the first quarter of 2024, a notable reduction compared to the previous year. Additionally, Goldman Sachs trimmed its workforce by 2% following the sale of home lending firm GreenSky in October. This divestiture aligns with the bank's recent strategic shift away from consumer banking to prioritize its core offerings: Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite incurring a $506 million loss from the sale in 2023, CEO David Solomon remains optimistic, citing the resurgence of capital markets and promising business prospects in Goldman's core sectors as the catalysts for the bank's turnaround. These results were especially gratifying for the bank, coming shortly after rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) experienced its sharpest stock decline in almost four years, acknowledging a more challenging outlook than previously expected.\n\nCurious about Goldman Sachs' outlook for the future? Here's a glimpse into what its management said during its first-quarter 2024 earnings call:\n\nIn debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients\u2019 needs. And we\u2019re growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of cautious optimism brewing at JPMorgan, we've scrutinized its leading stock selections. Noteworthy among them are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Misunderstood by much of Wall Street \u2013 and consequently a favorite of short sellers \u2013 Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.\u201d\n\n6.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are lining up nearly \u20ac1 billion ($1.1 billion) of debt financing that will allow buyout shop CVC Capital Partners to hold on to Multiversity, one of its university investments, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin\u2019s Glow Is Fading Malaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Huawei\u2019s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip\n\nThe bridge loan will support CVC\u2019s plan to move the Italian university group into a so-called continuation fund. Continuation funds are one of the tools deployed by investment firms to manage their portfolio companies, by allowing sponsors to roll over assets bought through older funds into a new vehicle. The process enables investors to either hold on to the assets for longer than the typical investment cycle, or to cash out of their stakes.\n\nOther underwriters on the debt raise include Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, CVC Capital Markets, UniCredit SpA, BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. A high-yield bond offering is expected to follow the raise, according to one of the people.\n\nThe company currently has \u20ac765 million in high-yield bonds outstanding which mature in October 2028.\n\nRepresentatives for CVC, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, BNP and UniCredit declined to comment, while those for Goldman, Deutsche and Credit Agricole didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\n\nCVC initially invested in Multiversity in 2019 through its CVC Capital Partners VII fund, and would go on to acquire the Italian online higher education provider two years later.\n\nIt now plans to transfer the business from CVC Capital Partners VII and into the new continuation fund, in which CVC Capital Partners VIII is also expected to be an investor, according to an April 16 statement. The fund will be structured as a single-asset vehicle, as Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nMultiversity has shown \u201cimpressive performance\u201d since CVC\u2019s initial investment, the private equity firm said in its statement, pointing to the business\u2019s ability to tap an \u201cunder served and largely under penetrated Italian undergraduate market.\u201d CVC also noted that the extension of the partnership would allow it to support Multiversity\u2019s growth ambitions while providing continuity and stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nLazard and Morgan Stanley are financial advisers to CVC on the transaction, which is subject to customary investor approvals.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea\u2019s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities A Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 most profitable banks in the US in 2024. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest news in the US banking industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024.\n\nThe US banking industry of 2024 is quite different from what consumers, analysts, and investors were used to before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Before the pandemic, interest rates were moderate and stood between 1.50% and 1.75% enabling banks to lend money to each other. However, after COVID-19 forced governments to shut down factories, hospitality establishments, and other business avenues, the rates were cut to nearly 0% in order to ensure that some economic activity remained and the drop in output was compensated to an extent by easy capital.\n\nHowever, as they say, there's no such thing as a free lunch, the inflationary surge after the lax monetary policies of the pandemic era has now resulted in interest rates eclipsing levels just before the Great Recession of 2008. Since banks are involved in the business of money, higher interest rates tie in quite closely to their operations. Generally, while consumers bemoan higher rates, banks are happy as they are able to widen their 'spread' and make more profits even if borrowing is dropping due to tighter monetary conditions.\n\nAdditionally, higher rates can also mean that banks find it difficult to manage their asset base, which is often another term for the funds that the banks have invested in securities such as bonds. Should rates fluctuate too much, then these securities have to be revalued, and the resultant losses can drive some of the biggest banks out of business. This became clear last year in the US banking crisis of 2023, and you can find out more details about it by reading Top 20 Most Profitable Banks in the World.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, April 2024 is seeing the start of the first earnings season of the year for US banks. Some of the biggest names in the US banking industry, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) are out with their latest financial results.\n\nStarting from Goldman Sachs since it has been one of the most troubled US banks as of late, its first quarter of 2024 results marked somewhat of a turnaround. Since the result, Goldman's shares are up by a cool 3.7% since its latest earnings results, and at the heart of this is Goldman's revitalized investment banking division that turned analyst expectations of a turnaround in deal making right. The bank's investment banking fees jumped by a whopping 32% in its latest results to stand at $2.08 billion. At the same time, Goldman's consumer banking division also reported a 24% growth in revenue, for a nice breath of fresh air after years of costly losses and write-downs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother record setting bunch of financial results in the US banking industry came from the New York City based The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK). Its first quarter earnings saw the bank post a respectable $4.53 billion in revenue, a modest figure when we consider banking behemoths the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). While we'll get to JPMorgan in a bit, BNY's latest quarterly revenue of $4.53 billion was the highest in its 240 year history. Not only did BNY's revenue beat analyst estimates of $4.39 billion, but its net income of $953 million and earnings per share of $1.25 also beat analyst estimates of $890 million and $1.19, respectively.\n\nHowever, as you might know, an earnings beat is not a guarantor of favorable share price performance after the earnings results. This was also true in the case of JPMorgan, whose $42 billion in revenue and $13.4 billion in net income were unable to prevent a 6.5% share price drop on the day of the earnings report. So why did JPMorgan's shares fall? Well, the US bank's net interest income dropped by 4% sequentially, a higher delinquency rate for the consumer banking division, and a disappointing decision to keep 2024 interest income guidance unchanged in the face of some quarters expecting an upward revision.\n\nOn the last bit, here's what JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum had to say during the accompanying earnings call:\n\nOur total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business. And as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront.\n\nWith these details in mind and as the US bank stock earnings season kicks off, we decided to take a look at the most profitable banks in the US. Some notable names are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC). 20 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024\n\nA person using a mobile device to access their bank account information.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable US banks, we ranked the 50 most valuable US banks market cap wise by their latest trailing twelve month net income and picked out the banks with the greatest profits.\n\n20 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024\n\n20.

        "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) says that by 2030, electric vehicles (EVs) will make up more than 35% of global new car sales. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the King of EVs despite consistent hurdles in recent months. But it\u2019s evident that the\u00a0competition is picking up, with other EV companies offering better models at better prices.\n\nAccording to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts, Tesla could see a sharp decline of 18% in 2026, marking a 65% decline from its 2022 data. Recent reports show EV sales are slowing, forcing other companies to cut prices and focus more on hybrid models. However, U.S. EV sales hit a record 1.2 million in 2023, with projections for more growth in 2024.\n\nAnalysts recommend considering these top EV stocks instead of Tesla right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD Auto Co. (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett showed an early interest in BYD Auto Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), sending one of his executives to tour its headquarters for China\u2019s car market. In 2008, BYDDF\u2019s co-founder Wang Chuanfu drank battery fluid to showcase its cleanliness. Shortly thereafter, Buffett bought a 10% BYDDF stake for $252M, although he originally offered to buy 25%.\n\nJust today, Shenzhen\u2019s EV giant revealed that they have named their newest electric pickup as Shark. The model aims to compete with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, and many are considering the Shark more than the latter. Also, this is BYDDF\u2019s first entry into electric pickups. The price for this model has yet to be disclosed, but it will feature a plug-in hybrid system. The launch date is expected before the end of the year, with this model targeting the global market.\n\nAdditionally, BYD Auto Co. surpassed Tesla as the top EV seller in Q4 of 2023. Debuted in November, the Cybertruck is only available in the U.S. market, and it also added some hurdles for its entry in the Chinese market. On the other hand, BYDDF has yet to venture into the U.S., reducing direct competition. The Cybertruck is fully electric, while the Shark uses hybrid technology.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese automaker Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) specializes in intelligent electric SUVs focusing on range extension tech, appealing to consumers wary of charging. In fiscal year 2023, Li Auto delivered 376,000 vehicles, an 182.2% year-over-year (YOY) increase, maintaining lower prices and expanding margins efficiently. Analysts forecast 75% upside with a $51 target on LI stock.\n\nRecently, the EV company slashed prices by 5% on four models, continuing the ongoing EV price war. The move follows Tesla\u2019s and BYDDF\u2019s price cuts. Li Auto cut prices by 18,000 to 30,000 yuan ($2,485-$4,142) and offered refunds to recent buyers. Earlier discounts were offered in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Li L6 received 10,000+ orders within 72 hours of availability. The vehicles are now in Li Auto\u2019s 480 retail centers in China. The Li L9, launched in 2022, had over 30,000 orders in the same timeframe. The company required a RMB 5,000 deposit for each Li L9 order, refundable within a specified period. The Li L6 launched on April 18 with Pro and Max trims, priced at RMB 249,800 and RMB 279,800. Orders opened with a RMB 5,000 refundable deposit.\n\nPanasonic Holdings Corp. (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic Holdings Corp. (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) stands out for its battery technology and diverse electronics portfolio. Collaborations with Tesla, Mazda and Toyota enhance its market presence. Despite market challenges, PCRFY aims to quadruple capacity by 2031. It is focusing on silicon-based technology for EV advancements and solid-state batteries for robotics and drones.\n\nThe company is still somehow dependent on Tesla\u2019s growth. In 2023, Panasonic aimed to increase more production, with plans to increase the numbers by 10% in Tesla\u2019s Nevada factory. Also, Panasonic\u2019s production numbers are expected to quadruple by 2031. Notably, the company is expanding its U.S. manufacturing and partners with Lucid. Investments in silicon-based and solid-state battery tech ensure this battery giant\u2019s long-term relevance.\n\nMoreover, Shinobi Therapeutics partnered with Panasonic Holdings Corp. and Kyoto University\u2019s CiRA to develop an efficient, low-cost iPS-T cell therapy manufacturing platform. Panasonic aims to make these therapies more accessible. Nissan and PCRFY will soon introduce a service connecting car data to home appliances via Internet of Things (IoT). Relevant information, like the charging status of your vehicle, will be able to be seen on TV screens or through home appliances. That\u2019s the future, and Panasonic Holdings Corp. is really leading the way in some important innovations right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs moves its top EMEA banker to Paris as the French capital challenges London\u2019s finance crown",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nThe question of which city would take the crown as Europe\u2019s financial hub from the City of London has gripped European capitals ever since Brexit spelled the end of London\u2019s full integration in the European Union. If Goldman Sachs is the arbiter, it\u2019s clear that Paris is the frontrunner.\n\nThis week, the investment bank announced that its top European banker, Dirk Lievens, would trade London for Paris, and with the move, Goldman\u2019s banking team in Paris would expand significantly.\n\nThe reason? \u201cThe whole financial ecosystem in Paris is enormous,\u201d Lievens told me on the phone this morning, referring to France\u2019s largest financial companies\u2014BNP, AXA\u2014and its (alternative) asset managers such as Amundi and fintech players like Worldline. Lievens estimates that about 25% of Europe\u2019s financial players by market cap or assets under management are concentrated in Paris, a far larger share than any other continental European city.\n\nPrior to Lievens\u2019s move, several other managing directors in Goldman\u2019s financial industry group had transferred to Paris, since Goldman\u2019s EMEA strategy under CEO David Solomon has been \u201cto go to where the clients are.\u201d Several other Goldman offices in Europe\u2014Frankfurt, Munich, Milan\u2014have also mushroomed under the firm\u2019s client-oriented strategy, becoming hubs for industrial, telecom, and natural resources clients.\n\nLievens\u2019s arrival, the banker told me, signals that Goldman wants \u201cto build a full pyramid in Paris, from junior to senior.\"\n\n\u201cMy move is symbolically and strategically important,\u201d he said. Ideally, \u201ca quarter to a third of our staff will be in Paris in the medium to longer term.\"\n\nThe relocation of Goldman\u2019s top banker is not an isolated event. Many of the largest global banks based in the U.S., including J.P. Morgan, Citi, and Bank of America, have recently expanded in Paris at the expense of London, attracted by more business-friendly policies under President Emmanuel Macron. Overall, 5,500 finance jobs recently moved from London to Paris.\n\nWhile Paris will no doubt get another mini-boost from Goldman\u2019s top banker\u2019s embrace of it, London is still the barometer for Europe\u2019s financial sector. Earlier this year, France backed London in its bid to remain the banking hub for euro-denominated trades. And even at Goldman, Lievens told me that \u201cLondon will remain our largest hub by far\u201d in EMEA.\n\nMore news below.\n\nPeter Vanham\r\npeter.vanham@fortune.com\r\n@petervanham\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has appointed Hidehiro Imatsu as president of its Japan unit, it said in a release on Thursday.\n\nImatsu, who is based in Hong Kong, will relocate to Tokyo and, as well as serving as president, will retain his current roles as co-head of global interest rates product trading and co-head of the Asia Pacific fixed income, currency and commodities.\n\nImatsu takes the place of Masanori Mochida, who announced he would retire last year after more than 38 years at the investment bank.\n\nMochida is credited with leading Goldman Sachs' expansion in Japan, where it has had a presence for 50 years.\n\nGlobal investors have become increasingly enthused by Japanese companies as long-awaited corporate governance changes and rising profits have helped drive the Nikkei share average to record highs this year.\n\n\"As international investors focus their attention on the Japanese market and the country's biggest companies look to expand their global reach, Goldman Sachs will continue to provide the highest level of service to clients under its new leadership in Japan,\" the company said.

Its governance committee has maintained that it considers a strong lead independent director, alongside the chairman-CEO role, as most effective at this time.\n\n\"We took decisive action to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths,\" Solomon told the meeting in his opening remarks. \"We are delivering on this strategy and putting the firm in a stronger position.\"\n\nA similar move at Bank of America to separate the CEO and chairman roles also failed after receiving 31% of shareholder votes, compared with 26% last year.\n\nAt both banks, investors approved all management proposals, including those on executive compensation, while rejecting all shareholder proposals.

        "content": "Some of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful bosses are facing new proposals this spring that would strip them of power by separating their CEO and chairman seats.\n\nShareholders at Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) will decide on such a proposal Wednesday, ruling on whether David Solomon and Brian Moynihan get to keep their dual roles.\n\nIn May, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s (JPM) Jamie Dimon and BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) Larry Fink will also face such tallies. And Citigroup (C) shareholders will vote next week to formalize a CEO-chair split in its bylaws even though the company has had an independent board chair since 2009. David Solomon, CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s not just Wall Street facing new calls for CEOs to give up some of their power. Thus far in 2024 shareholders have submitted 29 such proposals at S&P 500 companies, and more are expected, according to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).\n\nOther well-known financial sector companies facing such proposals this year are insurance giants American International Group (AIG), Allstate Corporation (ALL), and Prudential Financial (PRU) along with NYSE parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Same goes for Cleveland regional bank KeyCorp (KEY).\n\n'Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't'\n\nWhether to split the CEO and chairman positions has long been the subject of hot debate within the corporate world, pushed by activists who argue that it reduces conflicts within an organization.\n\nCompanies often push back by arguing that a lead director can offer just as much independent oversight.\n\nThe pressure to split the CEO and chairman roles in the US really ramped up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Between 2010 and 2023, 76 companies within the S&P 500 did so, according to ISS. By the end of 2023, nearly 60% of S&P 500 companies had those roles split.\n\nLast year 69 companies in the S&P 500 faced such a proposal, nearly twice as many as in 2022.\n\nAll, however, failed.\n\nThe push to separate the CEO and chair roles \"tends to go up when stock prices don't go over well at a company and shareholders are looking for something to rattle management,\" Shivaram Rajgopal, a Columbia Business School professor of accounting and corporate finance, told Yahoo Finance. Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't and the reason why that happens is because it's not the institution per se, it is probably the individual and how he or she exercises power in the company,\" Rajgopal added.\n\nMany of these proposals are not typically successful and face long odds. Last year, the proposals at Goldman and Bank of America, for example, garnered just 16% and 26% support.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be watching to see how much support the new proposals get this year, especially at Goldman.\n\nSolomon is emerging from his most challenging year ever as boss as dealmaking slowed across Wall Street and he grappled with a costly exit from consumer banking as well as a series of high-profile departures from the firm.\n\nThe firm\u2019s profit declined by 24% and Solomon\u2019s annual compensation still rose by the same percentage \u2014 to $31 million.\n\nISS and Glass Lewis are advising shareholders to cast votes Wednesday in favor of separating Solomon\u2019s roles.\n\n'An inherent conflict of interest'\n\nAnother vote that could get a lot of attention is at BlackRock, where Larry Fink will face the same proposal.\n\nThe head of the world\u2019s largest money manager has become a target of political critics who charge that he and his firm are the preeminent example of \"woke investing\" as well as others who say BlackRock is not living up to its environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments.\n\nThe shareholder that placed the proposal on this year\u2019s ballot, Bluebell Capital Partners, falls into the latter camp. It said in its submission that \"there is an inherent conflict of interest for a CEO to act as her or his own oversight as chair.\" BlackRock CEO and chairman Larry Fink. (Photo by JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images) (JOEL SAGET via Getty Images)\n\nFor Dimon and JPMorgan Chase, however, the proposal to revoke dual roles is certainly nothing new.\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest bank has faced some kind of proposal calling for shareholders to vote for an independent chairman for all but three of the years since Dimon first held both the CEO and chair seats in 2007, according to JPMorgan's filings.\n\nIt is possible that it could happen one day, even if this year\u2019s vote does not approve such a split. In 2022, JPMorgan\u2019s board adopted a general policy to separate the chair and CEO positions once the 68-year-old Dimon steps down \u2014 \"subject to the board\u2019s determination.\"\n\n\"The odds are Jamie will become chairman\" once he leaves as CEO, a person familiar with the situation told Yahoo Finance last year. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Mike Segar (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nDimon has made it clear he is not a fan of these proposals or the role played by proxy advisors ISS and Glass Lewis, which recommend how shareholders should vote on these proposals.\n\nHe criticized the firms for what he called a tendency to \"automatically judge directors unfavorably if they have a long tenure on the board\" and recommend \"split[ing] the chairman and CEO role when there is no evidence this makes a company better off.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 dividend growth stocks with highest growth rates. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their overall performance, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Growth Rates.\n\nAccording to a report by ProShares, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, delivered a 10.68% return since its inception in 2005 through December 2023. The index outperformed the S&P 500 during this period, which returned 10.05%. The report also mentioned that the Dividend Aristocrats index exhibited a lower volatility of 15.30% in this timeframe, compared with a 16.24% volatility of the benchmark.\n\nRegularly growing dividends is not an easy task as it demands financial stability, well-established business models, and a high level of reliability. For example, only a small fraction of companies in the S&P 500, specifically just 13%, qualify for inclusion in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. These companies are known brands with strong reputations for their quality, investment appeal, and resilience in the market. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, spoke with CNBC about dividend growth stocks. He said that investors should explore dividend aristocrats as these companies are typically well-established and financially stable. He further highlighted the importance of building a diversified portfolio comprising such firms, as it can offer peace of mind knowing that the underlying investments will continue to generate growing passive income over time, regardless of market fluctuations. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cWhen stock prices fall, it\u2019s so easy to panic, but dividend investing can overcome that because you\u2019re just trying to stay focused on your income stream. You don\u2019t care so much about the market\u2019s short-term ups and downs anymore.\u201d\n\nIn addition to their strong returns, dividend growers have also provided significant downside protection over the years, while capturing gains during market upswings. According to a report by Lord Abbett, this trend was particularly evident when examining the trailing one-year, which was marked by volatility in equity markets. During this period, dividend growth stocks experienced approximately 78% of the market downturn while outperforming the broader S&P 500 by around 11% during market rallies. The report also mentioned that dividend growers also present an opportunity for substantial total returns, particularly in scenarios where equity market returns are below average.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the best dividend stocks that have proved their resilience in severe market conditions while growing their dividends for decades. 14 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Growth Rates\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we used a stock screener to identify dividend stocks that have maintained consistent dividend payouts over time.

        "title": "China\u2019s Oil Buyers to Weather Tighter US Sanctions on Iran",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s private oil refiners could seek to buy more cargoes whose origin has been obscured as they prepare for fresh US sanctions on Iranian exports, ensuring crude continues to flow to the world\u2019s top importer.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Tech Giants Roar as Tesla Spikes in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Tesla Stock in \u2018No Man\u2019s Land\u2019 After 43% Rout Ahead of Earnings Ray Dalio\u2019s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing Biden\u2019s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed tougher measures against Iran over the weekend in response to an attack on Israel, promising to broaden the scope of restrictions with a series of measures targeting the country\u2019s exports that could become law as soon as this week.\n\nChina has long been wary of being caught up in the US sanctions net and the latest steps extend to foreign ports, vessels, and refineries that knowingly engage in the Iranian oil trade. Still, Iran\u2019s exports to China are not expected to fall away.\n\nSo-called teapot refiners \u2014 private outfits clustered in Shandong province and the leading beneficiaries of US sanctions on Iranian exports \u2014 are already bracing for the increased scrutiny. According to refinery executives and traders supplying them, that will likely include buying oil that has been manipulated en route, usually via ship-to-ship transfers around Malaysia and Singapore, or near Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nSome may temporarily back away as a precaution, but pressure on profits is already high with margins barely at breakeven levels, traders say. Buyers may instead seek better terms as the hurdles accumulate for Iranian exporters, even sidestepping middlemen in order to lower prices.\n\nTeapot refiners have become all but reliant on less expensive crude from sanctioned regimes in recent years, emerging in particular as the most important buyers of Iranian oil. That\u2019s been possible thanks to sidestepping measures including the use of yuan transactions, a domestic clearing and settlement system \u2014 known as CIPS \u2014 and local financial institutions isolated from large commercial players, such as Bank of Kunlun.\n\nRead also: Why the US Can\u2019t Stop Iran\u2019s Lucrative Oil Trade With China\n\nStill, US officials can trace at least some physical shipments of Iranian oil with the help of ship-tracking and satellite data, and identify the entities aiding in these flows. The bigger question is whether Washington is willing to enforce the sanctions and live with the consequences, including higher gasoline and diesel prices in an election year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdded Risk\n\nThe additional measures certainly add a \u201cnew element of risk\u201d at a time when crude is pricier and gasoline prices are up almost 30% year to date, oil analysis firm Rapidan Energy Group wrote. Others, including consultant Energy Aspects Ltd., question whether Washington will actually move ahead and tighten its grip, risking fuel inflation and disgruntled voters.\n\nAccording to official Chinese customs data, no Iranian oil has been imported by China since mid-2022.\n\nIn reality, China has taken an average of 1.2 million barrels a day of crude from Iran since the beginning of 2023, according to data compiled by Kpler. Much of these flows are passed off as cargoes of other origins, such as Malaysia, where these shipments are typically transferred from one tanker to another, allowing vessels to shuttle back to Iran for more crude.\n\nAny new restrictions, if introduced, would affect exports amounting to between 200,000 and 500,000 barrels a day, Amrita Sen, co-founder and director of research at Energy Aspects, told Bloomberg Television earlier this week. Iranian crude and condensate exports stood at 1.5 million barrels a day in March, based on Bloomberg ship-tracking data.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets Big Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner China\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires Skip the Robotaxi\u2014Tesla Investors Want a Cheap EV\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Today as Investment Banking Rebounds",
        "content": "After a two-year slump, investment banking looks like it's entering the early stages of a recovery. Investment banks reported earnings growth of double-digit percentages in the first quarter, driven by strong initial public offering (IPO) markets and a pick-up in debt underwriting. Here are three stocks to buy today to capitalize on this recovery.\n\n1. Goldman Sachs is a direct play on investment banking\n\nGoldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) is the closest thing to a pure-play investment bank that you can invest in. It wasn't entirely by choice. The bank made a push into consumer banking in 2016 and aimed to take in deposits and build a more resilient earnings stream across cycles.\n\nThat push didn't fare well, and it began winding down its consumer business last year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTherefore, Goldman Sachs should be one of the biggest beneficiaries of active capital markets, which was the case in the first quarter. The company's earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled from the fourth quarter and grew 27%, compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestment banking fees of $2 billion increased 32% from last year, with good growth in advisory, equity underwriting, and debt underwriting, compared with last year. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon noted several large IPOs, including Reddit, which were well-received and showed an increased appetite for risk from investors.\n\nIn addition, corporate debt refinancing was a common theme. Solomon sees a more accommodating issuance backdrop and more financing for acquisition as two things that have the bank expecting \"solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year.\"\n\n2. Morgan Stanley's CEO says we're in the early stages of a recovery\n\nMorgan Stanley(NYSE: MS) is another bank with sizable investment banking operations. However, it differs from Goldman because it has built large asset and wealth management businesses. These more diversified earnings can help stabilize the bank's business during lulls in investment banking.\n\nMorgan Stanley's EPS surged 138% from the fourth quarter, and increased 19% compared with the same quarter last year. Its earnings revealed mixed results within investment banking. For example, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) were down, and advisory revenue fell 28%. However, equity underwriting and debt underwriting revenue increased 113% and 37%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.\n\nTed Pick took over as CEO in January after James Gorman, who led the bank since 2010, stepped down.\u00a0Pick told investors that, \"The pipeline is clearly growing\" and that we are now in the \"early innings of a multiyear M&A cycle\" that could last three to five years. That, coupled with recovering equity and debt underwriting markets, could be a powerful tailwind for investment banking revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Citigroup's efficiency push could get a boost from investment banking\n\nCitigroup(NYSE: C) may not be commonly known for its investment bank operations, but it raked in $903 million in revenue in the first quarter. A rebound in investment banking and Citigroup's ongoing initiatives to become more efficient make it an appealing investing opportunity.\n\nIn 2021, Jane Fraser became Citigroup's CEO. Fraser's primary focus became streamlining operations and improving the bank's profitability.\n\nCitigroup struggled with its sprawl and last year announced it would wind down 13 global consumer franchises. The bank recently restructured its management team and will continue to lower costs to improve its profitability. Its cost-cutting initiatives have some analysts very optimistic about the bank.\n\nCitigroup's investment banking revenue increased 35% from last year, thanks to the strength in equity and debt underwriting. Like Morgan Stanley, Citi's advisory revenue dropped because of fewer M&A deals during the quarter. However, debt issuance surged. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told investors that \"improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly investment grade, which is running at near-record levels.\"\n\nFraser noted, \"We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter.\" She expressed optimism, noting that, \"Corporate sentiment is quite positive.\"\n\nThis is a welcome sign for investment banks that have endured several years of sluggish growth. It makes these banks compelling value stocks to buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Goldman Sachs Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Goldman Sachs Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Goldman Sachs Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Goldman and BofA face renewed calls to split CEO, chairman's roles",
        "content": "By Saeed Azhar and Ross Kerber\n\nNEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Bank of America will face challenges on Wednesday as proxy advisers recommend investors vote for the banks to separate their CEO and chairman's roles, in an effort to improve the companies' governance.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, investors seeking to improve risk oversight mounted efforts to divide the roles on Wall Street, an idea that has picked up new interest in recent years according to analysts.\n\nWith support from influential proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, some investors are leaning towards supporting shareholder resolutions to split the roles, but getting wider support will be tough.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I would love for a company on the echelon of Goldman Sachs to separate those two roles so there's more oversight,\" said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which owns Goldman shares. \"I'm a believer in the separation of church and state, even though I believe David Solomon would continue to retain decision making authority,\" Wagner said.\n\nGoldman CEO David Solomon, who holds the dual role, recently stepped back from bank's foray into consumer banking, which had piled up losses, to refocus the bank's strategy on two core divisions: investment banking and trading, and asset and wealth management.\n\nBank of America's Brian Moynihan has held the dual role since 2014, four years after he took the helm as CEO. He has been credited with turning around the company after the 2008 crisis.\n\nNorway's $1.6 trillion sovereign wealth fund, one of the world's largest public investors, said it will support the resolutions calling for Goldman and BofA to divide the roles.\n\nThe fund generally endorses nonexecutive chairs as being in a \"stronger position to guide strategy, oversee management and promote the interests of shareholders,\" it said in a 2018 report.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust 16% of investors backed a similar proposal for Goldman Sachs last year, while 26% of BofA shareholders voted in favor of the move in 2023.\n\nAt top U.S. banks, 58% had combined roles as of last year, versus 40% for all companies in the S&P 500, according to ISS.\n\nBanks often fended off such attempts by making other changes, such as giving new powers to a lead independent director, as Goldman did in 2013.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. lender, plans to split the roles when CEO Jamie Dimon eventually steps down, according to its annual proxy statement.\n\n\"The separation of CEO and chairman roles is one of those corporate governance 'best practices' that looks great on paper, but when you apply it to a real-world situation, you're stripping the title from a sitting CEO,\" said William Regner, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.\n\nOthers disagreed. \"From a governance standpoint, it makes a lot of sense,\" said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. \"These are two distinct roles - CEOs run companies, boards oversee CEOs. And combining the two weakens the oversight ability of the board, because the chair controls the agenda of the meeting, and the meeting itself.\" Despite efforts by companies to convince shareholders of their robust governance structures, a record 69 investor resolutions advocating for independent chairs were voted at S&P 500 companies last year, according to ISS.\n\nBoth Bank of America and Goldman contend that their lead independent board directors provide sufficient oversight. That view is shared by some key investors and analysts. \"A strong lead independent director, from a credit standpoint, can be just as positive as having an independent chairman,\" said David Fanger, senior vice president at rating agency Moody's.\n\nBlackRock funds voted against the independent chair proposals at Goldman and Bank of America last year. In separate reports about both banks, BlackRock said they each had \"a designated lead director who fulfills the requirements\" appropriate to the role.\n\nLead independent directors should have the ability to call and preside over board meetings of independent directors and provide formal input to their agendas, BlackRock said in its 2024 proxy guidelines. Vanguard and State Street, which also hold big stakes in Goldman and BofA, have also voted against past proposals to split the two roles. They declined to comment on the upcoming votes.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, Bank of America's biggest shareholder, did not respond to a request for comment.BofA shareholders have repeatedly voted in favor of the board retaining flexibility to determine the most effective leadership structure \"based on applicable circumstances and needs,\" the second-largest U.S. lender said in its proxy statement. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the firm's governance committee made clear that a strong lead independent director, alongside the chairman-CEO role, is the most effective at this time.\n\nInvestors are getting a \"clear story\" on Goldman Sachs' strategy after Solomon's decision to slim down its money-losing consumer business, Wagner said.\n\nGoldman's first-quarter results beat estimates, fueled by a recovery in its traditional mainstays - underwriting, deals and bond trading.\n\n(Reporting by Saeed Azhar in New York and Ross Kerber in Boston; Additional reporting by Greta Rosenfondahn in Gdansk and Nupur Anand in New York, Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "Those who invested in Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) five years ago are up 121%",
        "content": "Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) share price is up 95% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 62% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 21% , including dividends .\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Goldman Sachs Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 0.9% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 14% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nThis free interactive report on Goldman Sachs Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Goldman Sachs Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 121%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nGoldman Sachs Group's TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 21%. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 17%. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group  you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- CVC Capital Partners and some of its investors are seeking to raise \u20ac1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) in an initial public offering in Amsterdam, as the buyout firm moves ahead with its long-delayed listing plans.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into Chaos TikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US Claims Trump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial Underway Tesla Spends Weekend Cutting Prices of Cars and FSD Software China Is Front and Center of Gold\u2019s Record-Breaking Rally\n\nThe company and the investors are offering 114 million shares for \u20ac13 to \u20ac15 each, according to a statement on Monday. That gives the company an implied market value of \u20ac13 billion to \u20ac15 billion.\n\nCVC is issuing 18 million new shares, while existing investors will sell 96 million shares. Shareholders that are selling in the IPO include Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte, Kuwait Investment Authority, a wealth fund run by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and certain management shareholders.\n\nNone of the firm\u2019s active employees are selling in the IPO, CVC said in an earlier statement.\n\nCVC has been working on a listing since at least 2022, with previous attempts buffeted by volatile markets. One of Europe\u2019s best-known buyout firms, CVC manages about \u20ac186 billion of assets and owns stakes in companies including Swiss watchmaker Breitling and Lipton Teas and Infusions, according to its website.\n\nBlue Owl Capital Inc. plans to invest in as much as 10% of the offering, according to the earlier statement, increasing its stake. A listing of CVC will test investor sentiment toward alternative asset managers at a key moment for the industry.\n\nIt will also mark a revival for listings in Amsterdam, which lost its position as one of Europe\u2019s busiest listing venues after a blowout year in 2021.\n\nThat\u2019s while a rebound in European IPOs is also underway, though investors are keeping an eye on trading.

Galderma Group AG, a skin-care company backed by CVC\u2019s private equity rival EQT AB, has soared above its offer price, and Spanish beauty and fragrance group Puig Brands SA is set to raise around \u20ac2.6 billion in an offering.

        "content": "This article looks at the best places to retire in Ontario. If you wish to skip our analysis of retirement concerns in Canada, you may go directly to 5 Best Places to Retire in Ontario.\n\nRetirement in Canada\n\nAs the years pass by and you find yourself in the twilight of your career, the quest to ensure a perfect retirement begins to occupy one\u2019s mind. Being able to spend your golden years in comfort, enrichment, and adventure is a dream for individuals of all generations. In fact, a survey by the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY) revealed that a comfortable retirement was the number one financial goal among 46% of millennials and 56% of gen-Xers in Canada.\n\nFor those living in the Great White North, the availability of comprehensive universal healthcare and Old Age Security are two amenities to the envy of most seniors in other nations. However, retiring in Canada isn\u2019t as convenient as one might presume. Behind the veil of free healthcare and benefits lies a host of financial concerns that can derail, and even destroy, your hopes of a comfortable retirement.\n\nAccording to a survey by Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO), an average Canadian now believes that they will require approximately 1.7 million CAD to retire comfortably. If you feel this sum seems rather unrealistic, you might not be the only one doubting their chances of a perfect retirement. In Ontario, the country\u2019s most populous province, a study by Financial Services Regulatory of Ontario (FSRA)\u00a0shows that one in every five Ontarians believe that they will never be able to retire.\n\nDue to rampant inflation and an ever-worsening housing situation, building a nest egg for your golden years has become quite difficult for most Canadians. Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO), in their aforementioned survey, reported that 44% of Baby Boomers surveyed said that they had to extend their careers in order to compensate for an inability to save.\n\nCompeting Priorities and Unforeseen Expenses\n\nOne of the most common reasons for being unable to save for retirement is competing priorities. Our article on Best Places to Retire in Michigan highlights how competing life priorities can reduce an average American\u2019s retirement savings by up to 37%, per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS). For their Canadian counterparts, studies show a similar pattern as many Canadians struggle to save up for retirement in the face of rising day-to-day expenses. According to the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY) 2023 Financial Independence Poll, 3 in 4 Canadians worry about how to balance savings for immediate priorities versus saving for retirement.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, even those who do retire are confronted with the harsh reality that retirement continues to become more and more expensive. According to Sun Life Financial, Inc. (NYSE:\u00a0SLF), nearly 34% of retirees say their cost of living in retirement is higher than anticipated. One of the most common reasons for the increased cost of living in retirement is out-of-pocket medical expenses. Among Boomers surveyed by Sun Life Financial, Inc. (NYSE: SLF), 32% cited healthcare costs as a factor causing their cost of living to be more expensive than anticipated in retirement, second only to inflation (83%).\n\nAdditionally, the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY) reveals that many individuals fail to realize that they may not get to choose their retirement date. According to a survey, 41% of retirees revealed that their retirement date was unplanned. Being unable to retire as planned can have massive repercussions on your retirement pool due to an increased retirement tenure and unforeseen expenditures.\n\n\"We're finding that even Canadians who think they are well-prepared for their retirement years have not taken the unexpected into consideration. When their job disappears suddenly, they struggle with financing the added years in retirement that they hadn't counted on.\"\n\n-Lee Anne Davies, Head of Retirement Strategies, Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY).\n\nDespite this, younger generations fail to account for unprecedented expenses when planning for retirement. Sun Life Financial, Inc. (NYSE: SLF) states that while 31% of Millennials experience a chronic physical or mental health condition requiring medication or treatment, 52% of them admitted that these costs had not been factored into their retirement plan. Gen-Zs on the other hand provide an even more concerning perspective. Per Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO), 38% of Gen-Z respondents stated they had put off saving for retirement indefinitely, with the reason being that the current economic conditions made it unviable for them to spare any savings.\n\nAll these factors considered; it would be wise for Canadians of any generation to take heed of the fact that retirement is not going to be as straightforward as they had presumed. One of the best ways to avoid depleting your bank account in retirement is to pick a retirement destination that helps cut down on housing and living expenses.

They have navigated challenging macroeconomic environments and regulatory headwinds extremely well. The company\u2019s diversified revenue portfolio, including health insurance, pharmacy benefit management and healthcare services, has helped them outperform their peers.\n\nMoreover, their monstrous FCF generation and consistent EPS growth should not be ignored. UNH stock delivered record earnings results in FY23, with EPS hitting a record $25.12 per share.

They boast a widespread presence and brand recognition that few can rival.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has been heavily scrutinized in the last few years, as major fast-food chains raised prices on the back of inflation. While this has been a tough pill to swallow for some, consumers are still willing to pay the price. The company has been investing significantly in digital innovation, embracing digital ordering and expanding its loyalty rewards program.\n\nIn FY23, McDonald\u2019s grew its comparable sales by 9% YOY, with systemwide sales from loyalty members over $20 billion.

        "title": "Put $5,000 in These 3 Growth Stocks by 2025",
        "content": "Having started the year on a highly optimistic note, the market has now turned into an uncertain zone. The inflation report and the pushback of Fed rate cuts have left investors worried. However, some stocks can survive a soft landing. These growth stocks weren\u2019t made in a day. These companies have a rich history, solid long-term potential and the ability to keep going even in turmoil.\n\nIf the economy continues to grow, we will see these companies report higher earnings. With that in mind, let\u2019s look at the growth stocks that can thrive in the long run. If you are ready to take the leap, invest $5,000 in these three growth stocks by 2025 and build a resilient portfolio.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: DraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) has trended 22% higher since the beginning of the year and 112% in the past 12 months. That is no small feat, considering the high-interest environment. Trading at $42 today, this growth stock is a solid buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe online sports betting sector is set to grow in the coming years, and that means DraftKings is in a strong position right now. The company could see a higher valuation over the decade. Currently, it only exists in a few states, and as more states legalize online sports betting, DraftKing\u2019s market share will grow.\n\nFor Q4, 2023, the company reported a revenue of $1.23 billion, up 44% year-over-year (YoY), and reported a non-GAAP profit of $0.29 per share, up from the loss of $0.14 per share in the same period the previous year. Its monthly unique payers (MUP) stood at 3.5 million, and the average revenue per MUP came in at $116. For 2024, it is aiming for a revenue of $4.8 billion.\n\nSeveral analysts, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), have a bullish view on DKNG stock. Goldman Sachs has initiated the stock with a Buy rating with a price target of $60. It expects a 42% upside on the stock driven by healthy growth in existing states and an expansion after the legalization in other states. Morgan Stanley has a price target of $50 for the stock with an Overweight rating.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 14% year-to-date (YTD) and 23% in the year, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is making the most of the AI hype. Exchanging hands for $118 today, ORCL stock is racing ahead. It is building 100 data centers to expand its cloud services to other companies. That expansion is only the beginning as its current customers are more likely to adopt its solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a rich history and many years of experience in catering to the needs of clients. The company recently announced an investment of $8 billion in cloud computing and AI in Japan. Oracle reported impressive third-quarter results with a 7% YOY revenue surge and a 29% YOY rise in the order backlog to over $80 billion.\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) recently signed a deal with Oracle to deliver AI solutions to the government, and it also has a contract with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), where both companies will market their software and AI chips.\n\nIt could be a win-win situation for both the tech giants. There is no stopping the growth of Oracle, and it could make you big gains by 2025. It also pays a dividend and yields 1.35%, making Oracle one of the best AI stocks to own.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo matter how the market moves from here, people will not stop shopping at Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The company is a highly diversified business and has been holding strong over the past two years. Up 14% YTD, WMT stock is trading for $59 today, and I think it is highly undervalued. While it is close to the 52-week high of $61, it can keep moving higher.\n\nOne of the most popular retail chain stores, Walmart has been investing in the e-commerce businesses and saw a 23% surge in its global online sales in the fourth quarter. It manages more than 10,000 stores right now, and the business continues to focus on groceries, health and wellness products.\n\nKnown for offering lower-priced goods, the biggest grocery store chain isn\u2019t affected by the ups and downs of the market. That ensures the company posts strong financials and the stocks keep rallying upwards. WMT stock has soared 74% over the past five years.\n\nAnother reason to put money in this growth stock is its dividend yield. Walmart stock enjoys a yield of 1.39%, which makes it even more attractive for passive income investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Gold prices have been enjoying a very strong surge over the past two months, defying earlier predictions of a cooldown and surpassing the psychologically important milestone of $2,000 an ounce. The rally has significantly impacted the performance of gold stocks, reflecting heightened investor interest in the sector.\n\nThe yellow metal experienced a significant drop in U.S. trade on Wednesday after consumer price index data revealed higher-than-expected inflation growth in March, contributing to a surge in the dollar to five-month highs.\n\nHowever, gold prices staged a recovery in the following days amid signs of ongoing economic weakness in China, which bolstered safe-haven demand for the precious metal. Moreover, the increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also pushed gold prices to fresh record highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOverall, gold continues to attract safe-haven demand amid concerns about deteriorating economic conditions worldwide. Major central banks in Asia and other emerging markets have been increasing their gold holdings in recent months, with the People\u2019s Bank Of China (OTCMKTS:BACHY) purchasing gold for the 17th consecutive month, reflecting heightened risk aversion.\n\nThis rally in gold prices has also prompted financial institutions like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to revise their outlooks, with the investment bank now forecasting even brighter days ahead for the precious metal. Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for gold prices, citing the metal\u2019s relative stability despite stronger-than-expected U.S. CPI data this week. The bank noted that gold\u2019s bull market is not being driven by the usual macroeconomic factors, leading to their decision to revise their forecast.\n\nMore precisely, Goldman Sachs upgraded its price forecast to $2,700 per ounce by year-end, compared to the previous expectation of $2,300 per ounce. These gold stocks will likely benefit from the potential surge.\n\nRoyal Gold (RGLD) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRoyal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) is a leading gold royalty company. With a diversified portfolio of assets worldwide, Royal Gold offers investors exposure to the gold mining sector without the operational risks associated with traditional mining companies.\n\nRoyal Gold announced last week that its subsidiary, RGLD Gold AG, sold about 49,500 gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) in the first quarter of 2024. That comprised approximately 38,100 ounces of gold, 635,000 ounces of silver and 1,100 tonnes of copper under its streaming agreements.\n\nThe subsidiary had an inventory of approximately 16,800 ounces of gold, 349,400 ounces of silver and 400 tonnes of copper as of March 31, 2024. During the first quarter, RGLD Gold AG realized average prices of $2,054 per ounce for gold, $23.22 per ounce for silver and $8,453 per tonne ($3.83 per pound) for copper.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in February, Royal Gold reported net income of $239.4 million, or $3.64 per share, on revenue of $605.7 million and operating cash flow of $415.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported net income of $62.8 million, or $0.95 per share, on revenue of $152.7 million and operating cash flow of $101.1 million.\n\nRoyal Gold shares are almost flat on the year.\n\nNewmont (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nNewmont (NYSE:NEM), one of the best-performing gold stocks, is a leading gold mining company with operations and assets spanning several continents. Newmont offers a strong exposure to surging gold prices as it is one of the world\u2019s largest gold producers.\n\nIn 2023, Newmont completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited, becoming the world\u2019s leading gold company with robust copper optionality. The company delivered $1.4 billion in dividends and produced 5.5 million gold ounces and 891 thousand GEOs last year.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Newmont said it aims to focus on its Tier 1 Portfolio, comprising eleven managed Tier 1 and Emerging Tier 1 assets and three non-managed operations. The company also said it remains on track to achieve $500 million in synergies related to the Newcrest transaction by the end of 2025.\n\nNewmont stock is down about 7% on the year.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) The Barrick Gold (GOLD) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen over a bright blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is a leading gold mining company headquartered in Toronto, Canada. Barrick Gold is known for its large-scale gold production, one of the key reasons why investors see GOLD as one of the top gold stocks to own.\n\nBarrick Gold reported adjusted fourth-quarter profit that topped analyst expectations. Free cash flow totaled $136 million, compared to negative $96 million the previous year. For the year, Barrick forecasts gold production between 3.90 million and 4.30 million ounces, with all-in sustaining costs per ounce ranging from $1,320 to $1,420.\n\nBarrick maintained its dividend at 10 cents per share and introduced a new share buyback program. The board authorized a buyback program of up to $1 billion, reflecting the company\u2019s confidence in its financial position and commitment to delivering value to shareholders.\n\nThe GOLD stock is nearly flat on the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Best Bank Stocks to Buy on Q1 Earnings Results",
        "content": "First quarter earnings from the big banks are out, and the results, while mixed, were overall positive. The consensus view coming out of the Q1 prints is that the big U.S. banks are in good shape after two difficult years. The large investment banks are seeing their financial results improve as deals return to Wall Street. Initial public offerings (IPO), in particular, have rebounded after slowing to a trickle during the 2022 bear market. Revenue from trading activity also picked up during the first quarter with stock markets hovering at all-time highs.\n\nThe large commercial lenders are also performing well as retail-banking units remain strong with consumers continuing to spend at a healthy pace, including on their credit cards. Additionally, all the big banks set aside less money in Q1 of this year to cover potentially bad loans, which gave their earnings a boost. With the economy showing resilience and talk of a recession having faded, the outlook for banks remains very positive. Here are the three best bank stocks to buy on Q1 earnings results.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) A sign for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM).\n\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s (NYSE:JPM) first quarter 2024 financial results beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. The stock fell on downbeat forward guidance, but the Q1 print itself was very strong. The world\u2019s largest lender reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.44 compared to $4.11 that was expected among analysts. JPMorgan earned $42.55 billion in revenue, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $41.85 billion. The bank\u2019s sales were up 8% from a year earlier.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJPMorgan posted a $1.88 billion provision for credit losses in Q1. That was well below the $2.7 billion that analysts had anticipated. Trading revenue at the bank was down 5% from a year earlier. However, fixed income and equities results topped analysts\u2019 expectations by more than $100 million each, coming in at $5.3 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. As he often does, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon gave a downbeat outlook for the economy and interest rates during his earnings call with analysts and media.\n\nRegardless of the economic outlook, JPMorgan Chase continues to fire on all cylinders. JPM stock has increased 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) arguably had the best first quarter print among the major U.S. banks. The investment bank beat analysts\u2019 forecasts as its trading and investment banking revenue bounced back during the January through March quarter. Goldman reported Q1 EPS of $11.58 compared to $8.56 that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue totaled $14.21 billion versus $12.92 billion that had been forecast. Profits at the bank increased 28% from a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs said its Q1 print got a lift from a recovery in investment banking activities that include IPOs and mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Since last fall, there have been several high-profile IPOs from companies such as Birkenstock (NYSE:BIRK) and Astera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB). The strong first quarter marked a reversal for Goldman Sachs, whose financial performance suffered over the last 18 months as Wall Street deals declined amid a bear market and high interest rates.\n\nGS stock is up nearly 20% over the past 12 months.\n\nWells Fargo (WFC) Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grass\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) also had an impressive first quarter earnings report, announcing its profit rose 14% from a year earlier. The full service lender reported EPS of $1.26 compared to $1.11 that was forecast among analysts. Revenue totaled $20.86 billion versus $20.20 billion that was expected on Wall Street. Q1 net interest income, a key measure of bank earnings from loans, fell 8% due to higher interest rate impacts.\n\nDuring Q1, Wells Fargo set aside $938 million as provisions for credit losses. The bank said the provision included a decrease in the allowance for credit losses that was driven by real estate and motor vehicle loans. The bank also disclosed that it repurchased $6.1 billion of its own common stock during the quarter. Analysts and investors received the earnings print positively, sending WFC stock higher. In the last year, Wells Fargo\u2019s share price has gained 38%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Goldman (GS) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Goldman Sachs (GS).\n\nGoldman currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.54, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.54 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70.8% and 4.2% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Goldman here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Goldman, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs GS Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Goldman, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 7.2% over the past month to $35.15.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Goldman. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Goldman may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The battle against inflation is being won by the Fed \u2014 even if it doesn't appear that way to Mr. Market right now.\n\n\"The reality is that they [the Fed] have got to win the war on inflation, and they are winning, and it's coming down. They have got it on the right trend,\" Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdded Moynihan, \"The past would tell you it would take a longer period of time, especially when they started late.\"\n\nThere continues to be great focus on what Fed chief Jerome Powell said on Tuesday, that it will \"take longer than expected\" to get inflation down to Federal Reserve's 2% target. This comes as the latest economic data, such as retail sales and consumer prices, have surprised to the upside.\n\nLost in the Powell focus, though, were even more hawkish comments from Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson the same day.\n\n\u201cIf incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2%,\" Jefferson said.\n\nIn the wake of this commentary, fed funds futures are now pricing in only 40 basis points of rate cuts by year-end. Deutsche Bank pointed out this is the lowest this has been so far this cycle.\n\nDespite sticky inflation and more volatile markets, BofA managed to post an OK first quarter. But, pressure from higher charge-offs and softening credit quality did catch the attention of some on Wall Street.\n\nNet interest income fell 3% to $14 billion compared to the year-earlier period, roughly in line with consensus forecasts. Adjusted earnings of $0.83 a share beat analysts' estimates of $0.77 but dropped from $0.94 a year earlier.\n\nNet charge-offs increased to $1.5 billion from $807 million a year ago.\n\nRevenue fell 2% from the prior year to $25.8 billion, despite top-line gains in wealth management, investment banking, and sales and trading.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts, BofA hinted the first quarter would be the low point for the bank's key net interest income line \u2014 the difference between what banks pay on deposits and earn on loans.\n\nIn support of that, BofA's net interest income did improve by 1% sequentially in the first quarter and is projected to increase in the second half of 2024, BofA said.\n\nShares still fell about 4% during Tuesday's session but recovered by 3% on Wednesday.

        "title": "Wall Street Takes New Role as Matchmaker to Private Credit",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Banks have found another way to fight back after private lenders have grabbed ever larger pieces of the lucrative business of financing leveraged buyouts.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding Tesla Asks Investors to Approve Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Again China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel What If Fed Rate Hikes Are Actually Sparking US Economic Boom? Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs\n\nCitigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among Wall Street giants that served as matchmakers on recent transactions between smaller companies looking for loans and private lenders eager to provide financing. Their pitch to direct lenders boils down to this: we can use our vast network of corporate clients to help you find issuers that want financing, and take them through all the paperwork involved in getting a private loan, for a fee.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest step that big banks have taken to reclaim business their leveraged lending desks have lost. Historically the biggest buyouts would be funded with junk bonds as well as leveraged loans that were arranged by big banks then syndicated to a wide array of investors. Leveraged finance and related businesses generated about a third of Wall Street\u2019s investment banking fees.\n\nBut private lenders have been taking more of that business, forcing banks to consider other ways to get involved. In addition to advising direct lenders and smaller companies, firms including Wells Fargo & Co. and Barclays Plc have established formal partnerships with private credit firms to get a foothold in the market. In addition to setting aside a chunk of its own balance sheet to originate private credit deals, JPMorgan Chase & Co. has also been looking for partners.\n\n\u201cWhat we bring is an enormous and deep origination machine, and when the broadly syndicated market doesn\u2019t make sense for certain borrowers we can pivot,\u201d said John McAuley, the head of debt capital markets at Citigroup.\n\nRead more: JPMorgan, Citi Are Copying From the Private-Credit Playbook\n\nDirect lenders are clamoring for opportunities to loan money as the pace of buyouts slows. Private credit funds are sitting on a record $430 billion of uninvested capital they raised over five years of exponential growth, according to a recent survey by Barclays.\n\nPrivate credit funds have long had relationships with private equity firms and can find opportunities to lend to companies that have been bought out. But banks may have relationships with other privately held companies, such as family owned businesses, that are less well known to direct lenders.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where banks can create value,\u201d said Kipp deVeer, head of credit at Ares Management Corp., one of the largest players in the $1.7 trillion private credit market.\n\nBanks can be a one-stop shop for firms looking to raise capital of any kind. Ares-backed Press Ganey enlisted Barclays to help it find lenders willing to offer it $1 billion of low-ranking preferred equity to take out more-expensive junior debt. Goldman Sachs is advising Blackstone Inc.-backed Encore Group USA on placing at least $500 million of preferred equity.\n\nCitigroup has also capitalized on its existing leveraged finance relationships, privately placing $275 million of first lien notes for Pitney Bowes Inc., according to people with direct knowledge of the transaction who couldn\u2019t be identified as details are confidential. The bank was able to place a $516 million first lien term loan in the private market as part of a debt package for Gannett Co., according to the same people.\n\nRead More: Wall Street Reclaims $16 Billion of Deals Lost to Private Credit\n\nFor banks that have faced tougher capital restrictions following the 2008 global financial crisis, advising borrowers instead of lending to them is a way to cut risk, by keeping loans off their books.\n\nAt the same time, fees from partnering with direct lenders can earn Wall Street lenders extra revenue as they endure a deal drought that\u2019s lasted more than a year as high rates deter new buyouts. That\u2019s left leveraged bankers to arrange repricings and refinancings that typically pay lower fees.\n\nAdvisory work can also allow banks making a loan to collect fees from both the issuer and the direct lender. Even the large direct lenders will occasionally split fees with the banks that brought them the deal, according to people with knowledge of the market. They\u2019re sometimes willing to share anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points with the banks, according to people with direct knowledge of the deals.\n\nMarc Chowrimootoo, managing director and portfolio manager for private credit at Hayfin Capital Management LLP, is less willing to cede deal origination to banks \u2014 and the fees that come with it, he said.\n\nHis firm has brought banks into lending groups on its own deals, \u201cbut this is a very different dynamic to paying a fee and outsourcing your deal origination,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the recent deals, advisory work remains something of a cottage industry on Wall Street. Neither Citigroup or Goldman Sachs has plans to hire a group devoted to private-credit advice. At Citigroup, leveraged finance bankers Scott Slavik and Justin Tichauer are adding it to their remit. Goldman\u2019s bankers who advise small and mid-sized clients can also offer private-credit loans, according to Vivek Bantwal, co-head of the global financing group within Goldman Sachs\u2019s investment-banking division.\n\n\u201cIts under the same tent, we don\u2019t need to scale up to do it,\u201d Bantwal said.\n\n(Adds item to table of related stories, a previous version corrected title in 5th paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFor Multinationals, Africa\u2019s Allure Is Fading A Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand A Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Anne Marie Darling, a longtime Goldman Sachs executive, is leaving the investment bank after 25 years but will move into an advisory director role, effective today.\n\nDarling has helped build and scale several businesses at Goldman. She launched the global multi-asset platform sales team in 2014, which she continued to lead, and helped build the digital distribution effort for Marquee, the bank\u2019s digital platform for institutional and corporate clients, according to an internal memo viewed by Fortune. She was responsible for the bank\u2019s global FICC execution services business and the market structure and partnership teams. Previously, Darling was COO of Goldman\u2019s global securities division sales.\n\n\u201cPlease join us in thanking Anne Marie for her dedication and outstanding contributions to the firm, our clients, and our people, and in wishing her and her family the very best in the years ahead. We look forward to benefiting from her continued counsel as an advisory director,\u201d Ashok Varadhan and Dan Dees, coheads of global banking and markets, wrote in the memo.\n\nGoldman wasn\u2019t Darling\u2019s first job. After graduating from Brown University with a bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering, she spent six years at the American Stock Exchange, where she worked on the trading floor.\n\n\u201cI loved the markets,\u201d Darling said. This was the 1990s, and many firms had yet to fully transition to technology. \u201cI came from AMEX, where many things were traded on the floor with hand signals.\u201d She joined Goldman in 1999, just months after it went public, beginning as a senior analyst in its electronic trading group.\n\nDarling was promoted to managing director in 2007 and five years later made partner. She remembered that day in 2012 when she got the call from Gary Cohn, Goldman\u2019s president and COO, telling her she\u2019d made it\u2014she was part of Goldman\u2019s class of 70 partners that year. \u201cWhen I saw Gary\u2019s name come up on the phone \u2026 it was a great call, and I was beyond ecstatic,\u201d she told Fortune.\n\nDarling, who is retiring from Goldman, is now preparing for her next act. She\u2019s held discussions with a handful of clients in the alternative asset management space, including hedge funds and private equity firms, as well as technology companies that could benefit from her unique skill set, Fortune has learned.\n\n\u201c[Goldman] has provided me with tremendous opportunities in my career,\u201d Darling said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing experience.\u201d\n\nExodus continues\n\nNow, a dozen years later, Darling is one of several high-profile Goldman partners departing. Philip Berlinski, most recently global treasurer and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, is exiting Goldman after more than 25 years, while Jim Esposito, cohead of banking and markets, is leaving after nearly 30 years. Julian Salisbury, also a longtime Goldman executive and most recently CIO of asset and wealth management, joinedSixth Street as a partner and co-CIO. (To replace Berlinski, Goldman last week promoted Carey Halio, who\u2019s spent more than two decades at the firm, to take over as global treasurer.)\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman has recently faced scrutiny for its lack of women among the firm\u2019s senior ranks. David Solomon, when he took charge of Goldman in late 2018, claimed that promoting women into senior roles was a priority. But a Wall Street Journal report found that roughly two-thirds of Goldman\u2019s female partners at the end of 2018 had either departed or no longer have that title. Stephanie Cohen, once one of the most powerful women at Goldman, left in March and is currently chief strategy officer of Cloudflare. There\u2019s also Beth Hammack, cohead of the global financing group, who\u2019s retiring after more than 30 years at the bank.\n\nGoldman is a breeding ground for top talent, so it\u2019s natural that they\u2019d get great offers from elsewhere, Darling said. Goldman is \u201closing senior women because the Street wants to cultivate and access this amazing talent,\u201d she added. \u201cAs leadership has said, we also need to lean in and continue to do more to elevate women to the highest levels of the firm.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street says a Wall Street revival is finally here",
        "content": "Wall Street is surging again. This time, bank executives say it\u2019s for real.\n\nBank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) all reported first-quarter jumps in investment banking.\n\nThey did so because initial public offerings, bond issuances and in some cases M&A deal making beat analyst expectations.\n\nCollectively those revenues at the five big banks were up 26.6% from a year ago, to $8.08 billion. The biggest jump of 34% belonged to Bank of America, followed by 32% increases at Goldman and Citigroup.\n\nCEOs are not hiding their enthusiasm for the turnaround, following two years of depressed dealmaking.\n\n\"The pipeline is clearly growing,\" Morgan Stanley boss Ted Pick told analysts Tuesday, repeatedly using the world \"bullish\" to describe his outlook.\n\nWall Street is in the \"early innings of a multi-year M&A cycle.\"\n\nGoldman CEO David Solomon said Monday that \"it's clear that we're in the early stages of reopening the capital markets, adding that \"I've said before that historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever.\"\n\nThe investment banking rebound for these banks couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, serving as a boost while higher interest rates begin to eat away at more traditional consumer banking margins. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nWall Street has been waiting two years for this moment, enduring repeated false starts.\n\nLast year was supposed to be the year things turned around as executives touted a string of IPOs and merger announcements. Instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade, as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. (Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (SAUL LOEB via Getty Images)\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\n\"We've grown tired of predicting\" when investment banking will return, Bank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick said in October.\n\nBut this time CEOs are sounding more optimistic, citing the need for companies to grow or restructure following the pandemic along with mandates for private equity to return gains to their investors \u2014 known as limited partners (LPs).\n\n\"Corporate boardrooms have been quiet for three, four years and that is not sustainable,\" Morgan Stanley\u2019s Pick said. \"They need to move.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLimited partners that invested with private equity firms are \u201cputting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more capital,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Solomon added.\n\n\"And so I do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters.\"\n\nTrading was another positive for the five big Wall Street banks in the first quarter, as that revenue rose nearly 1% from last year to $31.52 billion and exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nEquities were stronger than fixed income. Only Goldman Sachs earned revenue from fixed-income trading that was higher from a year ago. Jim DeMare, head of global markets at Bank of America. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBank executives are being more careful not to hype expectations for trading, given how difficult revenues for the business can be to predict.\n\nBut changing expectations for the US and global economy did increase client activity at these banks.\n\n\"I still think there's uncertainty. You can't predict the future and as a result, clients have to kind of adjust their portfolios,\" Jim DeMare, Bank of America\u2019s head of global markets, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"That results in more business and good activity for us,\" he added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "On Monday, strong first quarter results from Goldman Sachs GS served as a nod to the notion that investment banking is strengthening. Notably, JPMorgan JPM and Morgan Stanley MS have been able to impressively exceed their quarterly expectations as well.\n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs\u2019 superb Q1 report has caused the most excitement in this regard, and investors may be wondering if it\u2019s time to buy stock in the finance titan.\n\nQ1 Review\n\nAt the moment the Zacks Finacial-Investment Bank Industry is in the top 16% of over 250 Zacks industries and Goldman Sachs has been a prime beneficiary. Correlating with such, it\u2019s noteworthy that Goldman Sachs\u2019 assets under supervision increased $36 billion during Q1 to a record $2.85 trillion.\n\nEven better, Q1 earnings of $11.58 per share crushed the Zacks Consensus of $8.54 a share by 35%. Plus, Goldman Sachs\u2019 bottom line stretched 32% from $8.79 a share in the comparative quarter. On the top line, Q1 sales of $14.21 billion came in 10% better than expected and leaped 16% from $12.22 billion a year ago. Other compelling highlights included Goldman Sachs being the worldwide leader in annouced and completed mergers so far this year.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDavid Solomon\u2019s Comments on Artificial Intelligence\n\nGoldman Sachs Asset Management sees AI shifting from the excitement phase into the deployment phase in 2024. Furthermore, CEO David Solomon followed up on this in yesterday's earnings call and expressed optimism about AI boosting the investment bank\u2019s bottom line.\n\nEssentially, Solomon believes AI will drive more business and make operations more efficient by carving out a significant opportunity for growth in deal volume fueled by AI-driven corporate investment.\n\nGrowth & Outlook\n\nAccording to Zacks estimates, Goldman Sachs\u2019 bottom line is currently projected to expand 43% in fiscal 2024 to $32.76 per share versus $22.87 a share last year. Fiscal 2025 EPS projections call for another 12% growth. Total sales are expected to be up \u00a09% in FY24 and are forecasted to rise another 4% in FY25 to $52.37 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent Performance & Valuaiton\n\nYear to date, Goldman Sachs stock is up +3% which has trailed JPMorgan and the S&P 500\u2019s +6% but topped Morgan Stanley\u2019s -4%. Over the last year, GS has risen +16% which has also lagged the benchmark\u2019s +22% and JPM at +29% while topping Morgan Stanley\u2019s virtually flat performance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThat said, Goldman Sachs\u2019 valuation has remained attractive with GS trading at 12.2X forward earnings and a slight discount to its industry average of 15.2X with Morgan Stanley at 13.6X and being a direct competitor in the space.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nFow now, Goldman Sachs stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Offering a generous 2.74% annual dividend, holding GS could certainly be rewarding for long-term investors from current levels. Goldman Sachs stock is very reasonably valued as the global leader in investment banking and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way given earnings estimate revisions are likely to trend higher.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Tatiana Bautzer and Saeed Azhar\n\nNEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's bosses are finally seeing signs of a broader pickup in investment banking, but they are not cheering too loudly just yet.\n\nInvestment banking divisions showed robust growth in the first quarter for the largest U.S. banks, which reported surging revenues and fees. Capital markets led the comeback, executives said.\n\n\"We have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm,\" Morgan Stanley's new CEO Ted Pick told analysts on a conference call after his first quarter at the helm. \"While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley's investment banking revenues jumped 16% to $7 billion in its first quarter, it reported on Tuesday, sending shares up more than 3%.\n\nAt Bank of America, fees from investment banking surged 35% to $1.6 billion, but its stock fell more than 4% as it set aside more money to cover souring loans.\n\n\"We're just happy to see the investment banking activity improve,\" BofA's finance chief Alastair Borthwick told journalists. He cited efforts to deepen is presence in middle markets and boost collaboration between corporate and commercial bankers.\n\n\"It appears that a rising tide has been lifting all capital market boats here,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, adding that Morgan Stanley's performance was \"excellent.\"\n\nThe results echoed strong performances at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. While executives cited the return of some activity, they were also quick to point out risks, including interest rate uncertainty, escalating geopolitical conflicts and the U.S. election.\n\n\"I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever,\" Goldman's CEO David Solomon told investors on a conference call Monday. \"CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors.\"\n\nGoldman shares rallied 3% after\n\nprofits rose 28%\n\n, beating analyst expectations.\n\nEquity capital markets have been a bright spot in recent months as several prominent initial public offerings (IPOs) fueled optimism that more activity would follow.\n\n\"We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter,\" Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told analysts on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCiti's investment banking fees climbed 35% in the first quarter, lifted by debt and equity capital markets. Yet mergers and acquisitions (M&A) were still slow to emerge, Fraser said.\n\n\"Corporate sentiment is quite positive, especially in the U.S., and our clients around the world have very sound balance sheets,\" she said. Still, markets were too \"benign\" in pricing in risk factors such as geopolitical conflicts, she added.\n\nCiti hired JPMorgan's former co-head of investment banking, Viswas Raghavan, who is tasked with growing its banking revenues when he joins later this year.\n\nAt JPMorgan, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum also struck a cautious note even as investment banking revenue climbed 27% to $2.0 billion.\n\n\"While it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue,\" Barnum told analysts on a call on Friday. \"And the advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley's Pick is more optimistic than other CEOs on the effect of geopolitical risks, saying in some cases it can even create incentive for international deals if global conflicts affect supply chains.\n\n\"We are in the early innings of a multi-year M&A cycle,\" said Pick at Morgan Stanley, who described investment banking and capital markets as being in the early to middle parts of the business cycle. \"We should continue to see all kinds of underwriting... I'm feeling good about this.\"\n\nLarge M&A announcements in multiple industries presented recent signs of rising confidence from CEOs and boards, that would support capital markets, Fraser said.\n\nGoldman's Solomon expects private equity firms, or financial sponsors, to get more involved in deals in an effort to start returning capital to investors.\n\nFraser, meanwhile, noted financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion that they need deploy.\n\nCitigroup shares are up nearly 11% so far this year, outpacing peers including JPMorgan and Bank of America, which have gained 6% and 3%, respectively. Goldman shares have risen 3%, contrasting with a 3% decline for Morgan Stanley. The S&P 500 banks index has climbed 6%.

        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 15, 2024\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, April 15th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\n\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We feel very good about our first quarter results, which reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our firm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths. As you can see, we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter. As laid out in January, we have three strategic objectives, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; to run world-class differentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at-scale. Across the firm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. A close-up of a financial advisor giving advice to a customer, demonstrating the importance of consumer and wealth management.\n\nLooking back on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever. CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital, and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors. Where we stand today, it's clear that we're in the early stages of a reopening of the capital markets, with the first few months of 2024 seen an reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of large IPOs across geographies and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs for Galderma, Reddit, and Rank is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows.\n\nIt's important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions.\n\nSee also\n\nLatest Insider Selling in April 2024: 10 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The growth equity unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has invested $47.5 million in Kontakt.io, a startup that helps hospital managers make decisions about patients, beds and equipment.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBeyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel S&P 500 Futures Steady After Selloff Rattles Globe: Markets Wrap Microsoft Invests $1.5 Billion in UAE\u2019s G42 in Pivot From China Iran\u2019s Attack on Israel Sparks Race to Avert a Full-Blown War\n\nIt\u2019s the 39th investment in health care from the bank\u2019s growth equity division and the deal is \u201ca good example of what is coming down the pipe\u201d for its portfolio, according to Christian Resch, the UK-based the Goldman partner who led the financing and will sit on Kontakt.io\u2019s board.\n\nKontakt.io, formed in Poland in 2014, makes small bluetooth-connected devices that stick on hospital equipment and software for managing the data collected by the sensors. The idea is to track practically everything inside a hospital \u2014 from patient beds to ultrasound machines \u2014 to help managers make decisions about capacity and replacement. The startup wants to build out an AI system that can offer suggestions to managers. It bills for the entire tracking system, rather than solo sensors.\n\nPhilipp von Gilsa, Kontakt.io\u2019s chief executive officer, said his business helps health-care operators curb inefficiencies and manage pressures like crippling nursing shortages. \u201cHospitals are extremely, extremely wasteful in how they treat their resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe help them address that and, at the end of the day, save money.\u201d\n\nHealth-care and life sciences IT spend is expected to continue rising, growing 8.3% in 2023 to $245.8 billion, according to Gartner estimates. But that money hasn\u2019t always found its way to startups, which have struggled to compete with entrenched medical suppliers and navigate byzantine health-care networks. While many startups offer tools for managing health records or apps for patient use, Kontakt.io is focused on operations. The company pointed to a 2019 study that found roughly a quarter of US health spending was wasted due to issues like fraud and administrative hassles.\n\nKontakt.io has largely grown without major outside capital. It first marketed to a range of sectors interested in tracking indoor data, but has since homed in on health care, which now provides 80% of its sales, according to von Gilsa.\n\nThe startup has \u201croughly 500\u201d enterprise customers, he said, including HCA Healthcare Inc. and the UK\u2019s National Health Service. Von Gilsa declined to share revenue but said 2022 sales exceeded the $7.5 million his company raised before Goldman\u2019s funding, and revenues tripled in the last twelve months. Kontakt.io, he said, has been profitable for the last four years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the financing, which came solely from Goldman, von Gilsa plans to hire more engineers to build an automated system for hospital staff using artificial intelligence. Machines will offer recommendations for daily decisions like how to stock certain machines or when to move patients into surgery.\n\nSome 4 million devices in circulation give the startup an edge in building this AI, according to von Gilsa, who said the large quantities of data gathered by Kontakt.io sensors can help train its models.\n\nLarger rivals, like GE HealthCare Technologies Inc., have also touted recent AI features designed to streamline hospital operations. Goldman\u2019s Resch said Kontakt.io\u2019s integration of sensors and software gave the bank confidence in its prospects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Bank of America (BAC) said Tuesday that first-quarter profits dropped 18% from a year ago as a key revenue source weakened, offering the latest example of how even the biggest banks are increasingly challenged by high interest rates.\n\nNet interest income at Bank of America fell 3% from the year-earlier period \"as higher deposit costs more than offset higher asset yields and modest loan growth,\" the bank said in a release.\n\nThat measure captures the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and other assets versus what it pays out on deposits. It is a critical contributor to profits for all banks.\n\nThree other giant banks \u2014 JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) \u2014 also disclosed challenges with this revenue source as higher-for-longer interest rates from the Federal Reserve continue to pressure lenders to pay more to keep their depositors.\n\nBank of America's stock was flat in pre-market trading.\n\nOne sign of how higher deposit rates are affecting Bank of America is that its non-interest bearing deposits fell 16% to $520.6 billion. Another is the rate it paid on US interest-bearing deposits, which rose to 2.53% in the first quarter compared with 1.28% a year earlier.\n\nDeposit pricing pressure is also rising at Wells Fargo and Citigroup, which disclosed they are shelling out more for that funding than a year ago.\n\nThat pressure is likely to intensify now that investors no longer expect a rate cut from the Fed in June, due to hotter-than-expected inflation data this past week and a surprisingly resilient economy. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nOne bright spot for Bank of America was its Wall Street operations.\n\nRevenue for investment banking, trading and wealth management all rose from a year ago and the previous quarter, outperforming analyst expectations.\n\nTrading and wealth management rose more than 2% and 5% while investment banking revenue of $1.57 billion was 35% higher compared with last year.\n\n\"Our wealth management team generated record revenue, with record client balances, and investment banking rebounded,\" said CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\n\"Bank of America\u2019s sales and trading businesses continued their strong 2023 momentum this quarter, reporting the best first quarter in over a decade.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Goldman Sachs Group Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "Over the past year, many The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs Group\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman, sold US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$394 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$401, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 27% of Denis Coleman's holding.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Goldman Sachs Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, insiders dumped US$14m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nDoes Goldman Sachs Group Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, currently worth about US$680m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Goldman Sachs Group.\n\nOf course Goldman Sachs Group may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. \r\nOn behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, April 15, 2024. \r\nI will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. \r\nThank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We feel very good about our first quarter results, which reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our firm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths. \r\nAs you can see, we are delivering on our strategy, and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter. As laid out in January, we have three strategic objectives: To harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; to run world-class, differentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at scale. \r\nAcross the firm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. Looking back on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever. CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors. \r\nWhere we stand today, it's clear that we're in the early stages of a reopening of the capital markets with the first few months of 2024 seeing in reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of large IPOs across geographies, and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs for Galderma, Reddit and Rank, is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing. \r\nIn debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment in investment grade with volumes hitting a record for the first 3 months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. \r\nGiven a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets, and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows. \r\nIt's important to note that alongside the reopening we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active and supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing financing revenues across FICC and equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All in, our top-tier intermediation franchise and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. \r\nIn Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes. And we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, alternatives and solutions. \r\nIn Wealth Management, we saw significant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion. In alternatives, we raised $14 billion in commitments despite a more difficult fundraising environment. And in solutions, we continue -- we saw continued demand for our outsourced CIO and SMA offerings. These are all areas in which we still see significant opportunities, and we have a proven track record a and demonstrated right to win. \r\nI also want to touch on topic coming up virtually every client conversation I have: Artificial intelligence. While there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of AI, there is enormous appetite for perspectives on how certain aspects may play out, including the time line for commercial impact, shape of potential regulation, impact on jobs and where value will accrue in the ecosystem. \r\nToday, we are proud to be at the forefront of advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations. As we look longer term, to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectations, there will be significant demand for AI-related infrastructure, and as a result, financing, which will be a tailwind to our business. \r\nFor our own operations, we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. We are focused on enhancing productivity, particularly for our developers, and increasing operating efficiency while maintaining a high bar for quality, security and controls. Like with any emerging technology, a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial. \r\nTurning to the macro environment. We continue to be constructive on the health of the U.S. economy. The Fed most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in 2024, but last week's CPI print has lowered market expectations. This will continue to evolve and be highly data-dependent. I'm also mindful that U.S. equity markets are hovering near record levels at a time when we see -- when we continue to see headwinds, including concerns around inflation, the commercial real estate market and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world. This combination could slow growth. \r\nWith that said, the U.S. economy has proven to be resilient, supported by a number of factors, including government spending as well as labor force growth driven by above-trend levels of immigration. So while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing, the trajectory is still uncertain. \r\nNonetheless, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of collaboration and excellence. Every day, as I interact with the people of Goldman Sachs around the world, I am consistently impressed by their talent, capabilities and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients. The quality of our people reinforces my conviction in the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to deliver for clients and shareholders. \r\nI will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nThank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $11.58, an ROE of 14.8% and an ROTE of 15.9%. We provide details on the financial impact of selected items in the bottom table, the aggregate of which was immaterial this quarter. \r\nLet's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7 billion in the first quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully allocated basis. \r\nTurning to Page 4. Advisory revenues of $1 billion were up versus a year ago amid higher completed transactions. We remain #1 in the league tables for both announced and completed M&A. Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million and debt underwriting revenues of $699 million both rose significantly year-over-year amid an increase in industry volumes. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market, though client engagement and dialogues remain robust. \r\nFICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment. Intermediation results were driven by better performance in mortgages, credit and currencies. Our long history of risk-taking acumen enabled us to effectively make markets across a number of different geographies and asset classes. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $852 million, which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time. \r\nEquities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly higher year-over-year as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially offset by lower financing spreads. \r\nMoving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were 18% higher year-over-year. Record management and other fees were up 7% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. As a reminder, we closed the sale of Personal Financial Management in November of last year, which contributed approximately $60 million in fees in the year-ago period. Incentive fees for the quarter were $88 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Based on our bottoms-up analysis, we expect to reach our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $3.8 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. \r\nPrivate banking and lending revenues were $682 million, up substantially as revenues in the prior year period were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our Marcus loan portfolio. Equity investments and debt investments revenues totaled $567 million. In equity investments, we saw improved performance year-over-year in our private portfolio that was largely offset by a markdown on a large public position. \r\nNow moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion. We had $24 billion of long-term net inflows, largely in fixed income, representing our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. \r\nTurning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $296 billion at the end of the first quarter, driving $486 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion in the quarter. We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year. More broadly, we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private credit to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to $300 billion over the next 5 years. \r\nOn-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $44 billion. In the first quarter, we reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.5 billion to $14.8 billion. We expect reductions at roughly this pace for the rest of 2024 and expect to sell down the vast majority of our HPI portfolio by the end of 2026, consistent with our target. \r\nNext, Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues were $698 million. Overall, segment profitability has improved with a pretax net loss of $117 million for the quarter. In line with our target, we expect to drive this business to pretax breakeven next year. \r\nOn Page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up sequentially on an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth quarter, as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially offset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $318 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio. Within our wholesale portfolio, impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last few quarters. \r\nTurning to Page 10. We continue to provide additional information detailing our CRE exposure. As you know, we moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion AWM alternative equity and debt securities and $2 billion in equity at risk related to CIEs. \r\nTurning to expenses on Page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 60.9%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions was 33%, reflecting improved operating performance for the firm. Non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. These costs declined year-on-year, even inclusive of the $78 million FDIC special assessment charge, and were down sharply versus the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%. And for the full year, we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%. \r\nNow on to Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.7% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $929 million. \r\nWe are currently running with a 170 basis point buffer above our capital requirements. Given expectations for significant modifications to the Basel III proposed rule, we should have materially more flexibility on capital deployment. We also remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. \r\nIn conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and our growing Asset & Wealth Management business. Simply put, we are delivering on the things we said we would do. We are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas for 2024 that we laid out in January which will help our businesses produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders and continuing to support our clients. And we remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. \r\nWith that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\n\nGlenn Paul Schorr\n\nI got a tough one because you are definitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out, and of course, the sustainability of banking is what it is. I noticed your lower pipeline. But the real question I have is the sustainability of the whole package. Meaning, you just had really strong revenue across the board on everything. Comp was up with that normally, but non-comp was down, the provision's down and RWA didn't increase even though you were growing your financing. So I'm giving you a softball here and just saying, what, of that package, can continue to stick?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nI appreciate it, Glenn. And I think there are a bunch of things that continue to stick because one of the things you know that we've been focused on is building a more durable business, and that there are a handful of things when you look across the whole package, we've made significant progress over the course of the last 5 years.\r\nCertainly, building our financing business in our markets business is something that's more durable and more sustainable. We still think there's lots of room to grow. And look, the world's growing. And when the world grows and our clients grow, they need us to finance them. We've got the capital to deploy as long as we can drive attractive returns with that client base, and so we stay focused on that. \r\nWe've doubled our management fees on our Asset & Wealth Management business over the last 5 years, and we continue to be very focused on fundraising, our ability to deliver on that. Those are more durable revenues. And there's operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve. You've seen the margin improvement obviously in that business, but that business still has a higher capital density than we'd like that business to have. And we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress there. \r\nOverall, I think we've meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share, and we're just very, very focused on our relative participation and the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients. And we've said over the course of the last few years, and there have been lots of questions on it, are those wallet shares sticky? I think the wallet shares are. What I can't tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every quarter-to-quarter. \r\nBut when you look at the breadth, the leadership position, the global nature of these businesses, and you look at the whole package, these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns where we're very well positioned. And we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position.\n\nGlenn Paul Schorr\n\nI definitely appreciate all that. Can we talk just as a follow-up on just the non-comp piece? And you had some big drops in amortization and depreciation and some marketing and stuff. So are those actually run rate levels now going forward also? Because that was a nice positive surprise.\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nGlenn, it's Denis. As we said over the last number of quarters, been very, very focused on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. There clearly are inflationary pressures that impact the number of items in our non-comp expense. The sharp decrease sequentially, we're pleased with, as well as the year-over-year decrease. But there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily expect to repeat. \r\nAnd so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-comp expense base. But it's something we're going to remain very, very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion. But I think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\n\nEbrahim Huseini Poonawala\n\nI guess I just wanted to follow up, David. You mentioned AI. And I would love -- there is still -- it's hard in our seats to figure out what's hype, what's real. If you can double-click on some of the comments you made around comparing what's going on with AI today versus maybe the dot-com bubble around the runway this might create for capital markets, IB. Not just for this year, but beyond. And then also the other side around is there line of sight of how much more efficient Goldman itself can get by deploying AI?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure. So I mean, big picture, and look, I'm not a stock picker, so I'm not going to comment when you make a comparison to the Internet explosion in 1999, 2000, 2001. I'm not going to comment around that. \r\nI think we have -- we've got a lot of stock market capitalization that's being driven by big platforms that I think have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies. But broadly speaking, these technologies require certain things, including infrastructure, power, and these things require financing to drive the scale that's going to be necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses competitive at pace. And that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business that we've seen in the context of other areas of significant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time. \r\nSo I actually think there's a very, very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses. And we're talking about a level of scale that is, candidly, unprecedented. And so I think that opportunity is something over the course -- this is not a quarter-to-quarter thing, this is over the next 5 to 10 years. And we're very, very focused on it and very engaged. And by the way, it's not just companies, it's governments, obviously, that are making enormous investments and bringing infrastructure into their locale. And so all of this is something that we're very strategically focused on. \r\nDouble clicking and getting more narrowly focused on Goldman Sachs. I would just say we see enormous opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efficiency. Our use cases that we're testing and that we're implementing focus on those two areas. But I'd really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients rather than expecting an efficiency gain that becomes very cost-accretive. \r\nI think one of the most important things for this firm and the success of this firm is the time our people spend with clients, serving our clients, executing for our clients. And these tools give us more productivity. And also, when we look at our data sets and what we have internally and ability to deliver them a value-added package of information, thought process that we think can be differentiated. \r\nAnd so we're very focused on the productivity side. Although, of course, we have analog systems and processes where there will be efficiency, and we're also focused on bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure.\n\nEbrahim Huseini Poonawala\n\nThat's good color. And just separately for the Goldman stock, right, I think from an investor standpoint, a lot of focus on how quickly we can grow the share of asset management. You've talked about the HPIs coming down, alt assets going up. How else should shareholders and prospective investors think about strategy around growing the asset management revenues? And is inorganic growth at all part of the strategy and in terms of how management is thinking about things today?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSo we -- in January, we said to you, we thought high single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time. We're executing on that. We are very focused at the moment on our organic execution. The firm obviously generates a lot of capital. There could be a time in the future where something might come up that could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix. But at the moment, our focus is on the execution of what we have in front of us, and we are making good progress. \r\nBut I think we've put out a handful of metrics, both in terms of top line growth, our ability to continue to fundraise. You saw that we highlighted $15 billion of fundraising in alternatives in the first quarter. We said we expect to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this quarter -- this year. Obviously, the $15 billion keeps us on pace for the $40 billion to $50 billion we said we could raise this year. That doesn't stop this year. We think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of years going forward. \r\nSo we're focused on the things that matter in asset management. What matters? Performance matters, client experience matters. We're incredibly focused on both those things and working hard to make sure we use our global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very effectively.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.\n\nChinedu Bolu\n\nMaybe I'll ask Glenn's question in a different way. If I look at that 18% ROE for the Global Banking & Markets business, it really catches my eye here. So how would you characterize this quarter's performance? Is it like sort of normal-ish to you? Does it feel maybe peakish to you? Again, just trying to figure out if 18% ROE is anywhere net sustainable for that business.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSo it was a -- there's no way to shave this. It was a strong quarter for Global Banking & Markets. Peak? I mean, I can point the last few years to quarters in Global Banking & Markets where the returns were higher. But I certainly wouldn't say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in Global Banking & Markets. We've said clearly we think this is a mid-teens business through the cycle. The performance this quarter was higher, the performance last year was meaningfully lower. I think the right thing to focus on, Christian, is mid-teens through the cycle. That's the way we think about it. \r\nAnd there was client activity and opportunity set for us this quarter. And I think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with our clients, there is opportunity in the market. We're good at capturing that, delivering that for shareholders. And then when the environment's more tough, so this is a more durable and sustainable business than people may have looked at it in the past. \r\nBut I would view this as a very strong quarter on Global Banking & Markets and not what we would target as the average run rate of the business.\n\nChinedu Bolu\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. Maybe on to private wealth. If I'm reading Slide 9 correctly, you had something like $17 billion of inflows into wealth management AUS. So that would equate to something like 9% organic growth, which is well above peers. I would call it best in class. So can you give more color on what's driving that growth? Maybe any color by regions or products as to what's resonating with clients? And again, longer term, how are you thinking about sustainability of that level of organic growth?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nYes. Again, this I think comes down to focus. And you know we made some very -- we talk about conscious decisions. We have talked about broadening our wealth platform to get much more broadly into what I'd call kind of high net worth wealth management. And with the sale of United Capital, we continue to be very focused on our ultra high net worth platform. It is an extraordinary platform. I do think it's a best-in-class platform. \r\nI do think that the ultra high net worth business is still a very fragmented business. While we have leading share, I think those shares are still, on a global basis, a leader is a single-digit share. There's a lot of wealth in the world. There's a lot of wealth accumulating. We are very, very well positioned to continue to capture that secular trend. And I think the business is performing very, very well. \r\nOur alts franchise, I think, is differentiated and we're allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients. And I think that's something that gives us a strong secular tailwind. We're expanding our private banking activity. That's not something that we have been focused on, which I think is also strengthening our position as a wealth manager. So I think there's a good runway for this business. \r\nI do think it's a best-in-class franchise that has room to grow, and I think you're seeing it perform well, and we're very focused on it. I think the sharp decision around how we're going to focus this business, I think we're benefiting from it at the moment.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBetsy Lynn Graseck\n\nCan you hear me okay? Great, I just want to make sure. All right. So just two follow-ups. One, I heard all the commentary about how the 1Q is run rate a little bit better than run rate on average over time. But it doesn't take away from the fact that your 1Q was very strong. I just wanted to understand, was there anything that we should understand about the revenues in equities and fixed income, for example, that were different this quarter? \r\nAnd the reason I ask is VaR efficiency was so strong, right? You've delivered very strong trading revenues on VaR that was basically flat Q-on-Q. I mean, a little down, a little up, depending on which asset class you're looking at. So was there anything in the -- when you mentioned you stepped into client activity and opportunity set. Was there anything unique about that opportunity set that enabled you to do this in a way that didn't really tag VaR at all?\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSure. So Betsy, it's Denis. Nice to hear from you. Look, to give you some color on that, I wouldn't point to any particular discrete item. I would say the revenue generation, the activity was broad-based. But in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share and wallet share that we've made across the client franchise over time, we also did see good opportunities to risk-intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies, across asset classes. \r\nAnd I would observe that over the course of the quarter, it was just a very benign operating environment. Credit spreads were tightening, equity valuations were going up, and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our Global Banking & Markets business as well. The first quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well. \r\nSo we think we really captured a lot of the opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement. And as David said, that may not necessarily be the case each and every quarter, particularly in FICC and equities. So when we talk about like a Global Banking & Markets segment overall, clearly more upside across banking, but a strong performance across both FICC and equities in Q1.\n\nBetsy Lynn Graseck\n\nSuper. That's really helpful. Just one other follow-up. David, you mentioned you're able to deliver alts in a unique way to the wealth platform that you've got. Could you just give us a little more color as to what you're thinking about there that we should understand?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure. I think one of the things that our wealth management franchise finds very attractive is we run an open platform. And so when it comes to alts, we obviously have a very, very broad; very, very deep; very, very, very unique offering as one of the top 5 or 6 alt providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own product, what we're manufacturing out of our asset management business. \r\nBut in addition, we want an open platform where we deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all different world-class managers around the world across the spectrum. And so I think that's a very, very unique offering that very, very affluent people who wealth manage at Goldman Sachs find super attractive and super differentiated.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSo wanted to ask one on your M&A franchise. So the recovery in announced M&A has been really impressive, but really kind of dominated by strategics. And given your strong franchise among sponsors, I'm curious to get an update about what you're seeing among that cohort and maybe when you might expect we will see a ramp in announcements from the sponsor side.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nYes, Brennan, that -- appreciate that question, and that's a sharp observation on your part. The sponsor activity is still muted, but I would say it's definitely picking up. The engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully improved. And as I've said before, sponsors make money, both for themselves and for their investors by buying things and selling things. And the level of activity has been incredibly muted. \r\nAnd when you look at the LP community, the LP community is putting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more capital and increase the velocity of capital return. And so I do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters. I'd say the activity and interaction and engagement is higher in the first quarter than it was throughout 2023. But I would say it's still operating at lower levels. There's a lot of upside for our business. \r\nOur business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity. And so to the degree that it did pick up, that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets broadly. When I look at our leveraged finance deals book, it's still operating at historically very, very low levels. We feel fortunate that we've got a good amount of capital flexibility, that was to accelerate the deploy, which is obviously very accretive and attractive business. We're not seeing -- accelerate yet, but I think it's coming. \r\nAnd certainly, the sustained level we've had over -- the level we've had over the course of the last 12 to 18 months is not sustainable. It will pick up, it's just a question of when. And so that is a potential tailwind for our business in future quarters.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nGreat. Thanks for that color, David. I appreciate it. And then another question on alts. So fundraising looks really good. I know there can be some noise in the revenue. So just curious about the alts revenue down year-over-year and the AUS only up sort of marginally. So could you give some color around what was happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise?\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSure. Brennan, it's Denis. So a couple of things. Obviously, the movement in AUS is a function of how we fund raise, how we deploy and overall levels. We have had a lot of success fundraising, not just in the last quarter at $14 billion, but now with the whole $265-plus billion since the original Investor Day. But there is a lag in terms of when some of that capital is put to use and actually moves into AUS. Not all of our funds that are raised are AUS-ing immediately. So I think that is something you can look out for in future periods.\r\nAnd then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts. As David was walking through our platform, our wealth platform in terms of having Goldman Sachs proprietary funds, also open architecture, third-party platform, some of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform. As we looked over the sequential period, we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter last year.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\n\nMichael Lawrence Mayo\n\nDavid, you reiterated the desire for Goldman to have a more narrow strategic focus, but you still have some cleanup from the past charges this quarter for GreenSky, the GM card. Platform Solutions still lost $117 million. So I'm just trying to figure out in this context where transaction banking stands. \r\nI mean, you had 8% year-over-year growth, so that's decent. But 3 years ago, March 1, you guys said transaction banking, you're building global payments around the world. And then March 8 of this year on Bloomberg, it says that you're closing Japan and now you're focusing on the U.S. and Europe. \r\nSo on the one hand, are you simply pulling back your ambitions? On the other hand, maybe you have more financial discipline, and you're making sure these adjacent activities are generating profits instead of just growth.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nLook, Mike, I think you summarized it well. I think it's yes to a bunch of the things that you said. We're looking hard, we are. I think it's very important for me to say that we're very committed to transaction banking. We think we've got very, very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time. But there's no question, we're very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately. And that it's not just top line growth, that it delivers profitability. It's something that fits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things that we can bring to our clients. \r\nI think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately. And so we've narrowed that, but we remain committed, focused, and growing. And I think this is a medium- and longer-term project that we will deliver on. It's small, but I think we've got the right focus. We made a hire to bolster the expertise in the leadership and we're moving forward on that strategy. \r\nAnd with respect to the cleanup, we continue to narrow and clean up. The after-tax loss from the platforms is less than $100 million. We've said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or profitability in 2025, and we're executing against that.\n\nMichael Lawrence Mayo\n\nJust to follow up on the transaction banking. You said some ambitions were too broad. Again, it's better to have profitable growth than just growth. So point acknowledged. But what happened? I mean where were you kind of underestimating expenses or the build-out costs? Or what was more difficult than you had anticipated?\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nWell, I think there were a number of things, Mike, that came together. I think when you're building new businesses, you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you hold people accountable as you advance. And I think there were things where we thought we could do more globally, that candidly, when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering, there was more friction in that context. And so we've chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that. That doesn't mean later there might not be opportunity to do it, but we think for now that's the right action. \r\nI'd say secondarily, the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created headwinds and a different lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities. And so that's something else that went into the mix. \r\nAnd so look, I think one of the things that we try to do is to look at everything with facts, with data, with information, to be unemotional. And to be willing to say, okay, this isn't exactly right, so we're going to adjust. And I think we're showing that we're willing to adjust and make adjustments always with a goal of growing the firm and delivering for shareholders, driving profitable businesses that deliver accretive returns for shareholders. \r\nWe get some things right and we get some things wrong. But when we look at the information of the data and it's not exactly perfect, we'll adjust.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\n\nSteven Joseph Chubak\n\nSo wanted to follow up, David, with the earlier discussion just on sponsor-related activity. Private credit fundraising remains robust, but the syndicated markets are also reopening. Just wanted to better understand what you're seeing in terms of competition and syndicated versus private markets, how it's impacting your IB and alt franchises? And just given some of the recent price coverage, maybe just speak to your growth ambitions in the private credit space more broadly.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nSure. I'm going to -- I'll make a couple of comments, but I'm going to ask Denis to comment, too, because as you know, Denis ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time. But I'd just say, first, the narrative that in some way, shape or form, this is about the syndicated market versus the private market, I think, is an oversimplification. \r\nAs transaction volumes increased, particularly in the sponsor community, the amount of activity that will come out of the syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully. We're very well positioned for that. We are one of the largest players in that. And that area is operating at cyclical lows at the moment. But that's going to continue to be a very, very important part of capital formation and it's not going away. \r\nThe growth in private credit will continue. I think we're very well positioned for that. We have about $130 billion of private credit assets, which makes us one of the largest players. I've said publicly, we have aspirations to continue to invest and grow, and we see a number of places where we can do that. We're very focused on that. \r\nI do think it's important to highlight that we've not been through a credit cycle in a very long time. And so while there are lots of private credit players that continue to grow and expand, how those platforms and those businesses will respond when we do go through a credit cycle, and we will go to a credit cycle, is a little bit unclear at the moment. But I think strategically, we're in a very, very interesting position because we have the ability to marry for our clients, both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities. \r\nAnd you can see that. I mean, I can point to a transaction that was done in the last few months where we did just that. And in fact, it wasn't just in credit, it was an equity, too. You can look at the Endeavor transaction, and you can look at our ability to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender, but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for our investors, is an example of the way that I think our franchise and our platform is differentiated. \r\nDenis, do you want to add anything to those comments?\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSure. I think it's well covered. I mean, I think there's been a lot of discussion over the past year of sort of private credit versus syndicated alternative. But the reality is the syndicated alternative didn't really exist, and so it was really just a discussion around private credit. With first quarter activity levels, you now see a viable, functioning and healthy syndicated loan market. The vast majority of the activity was actually refinancing. A lot of that refinancing was refinancing private credit capital structures with the more attractive pricing available in the broad-based syndicated market. \r\nSo the reality is these are all just forms of credit made available to different borrowers. And over time, I think there will be a much more normalized mix where you'll see underwritten as well as directly lent solutions, in some cases, existing in the same capital structure. \r\nAnd I think we're just in a healthier environment, but from Goldman Sachs' perspective, is positive because the data points that we now see across the leveraged lending market make sponsor estimated weighted average cost of capital much more observable, and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some incremental sponsor-related change of control activity. \r\nSo I think the sort of two markets functioning side-by-side is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for Goldman Sachs.\n\nSteven Joseph Chubak\n\nReally helpful color. And for my follow-up, just on capital management. Your CET1 continues to build. You're well in excess of the regulatory minimums. The direction of travel on Basel III in terms of expectations around the proposal, certainly more favorable. At the same time, it now looks like you might be more constrained by the SLR, which declined to 5.4%. I know that's never intended to be the binding constraint, but I was hoping you could just speak to how you're managing to the leverage constraint, which at least appears to be binding at the moment, and what we should act in terms of the pace of buyback and whether that actually informs your expectation there?\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSure. Thanks, Steven. So yes. You're right on all counts. Obviously, we have a variety of both capital and liquidity ratios that we manage to over time. The SLR is a slower-moving ratio, as you know, but our bindingness can move back and forth between various ratios over time. And we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with respect to our activities to manage that. But I appreciate the question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\n\nDevin Patrick Ryan\n\nGreat. First question just on kind of maybe a bigger picture on the wallet share in markets. I know this has really been ongoing work for the firm, and obviously not just the quarter, but really the past few years, this has been pretty consistent story. \r\nSo if we kind of move aside financing, I'd love to maybe just drill down on some of the individual products that are accelerating in equities and FICC. And where are you most pleased with the execution that has occurred over the last several years? And then you -- still where you see the biggest room to close any gaps that are maybe still there.\n\nDavid Solomon\n\nAt a high level, and this was one of the things that we observed, and I think we got right over a period of time. We started with the top 100, we're now focused on the top 150 clients in these businesses. The top 150 clients provide a very significant portion of all the activity in this franchise. And so your share with them and managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares. \r\nI think the thing that we've done well and that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities in all silos. And the ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the firm is a big change for us versus where we might have been a decade ago. And so it's something we're very focused on. \r\nThere are times when there's more activity in commodities. There's time when there's more activity in credit. There's time when there's more activity in mortgages. It moves and it ebbs and flows. But what we're really trying to do is to make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most effective way, and we've made real progress in that over the course of the last couple of years. \r\nI think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that, in the top 150, I think we stand at slightly under top 3 with 117 of them. Don't hold me to that number exactly. It's probably, okay, 117 of them. So obviously, we have progress to make because there's no reason why Goldman Sachs shouldn't be top 3 with the overwhelming majority, much closer to 90% of those 150. \r\nAnd also when you look at top 3, there are also clients were we're third, where we absolutely should be first or second. So we continue to drill down, we continue to go talk to our clients, listen to our clients, get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them. And that discipline and that rigor I think is helping us execute for them, but there's more work to do. We don't take our position for granted. We try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver and execute for them.\n\nDevin Patrick Ryan\n\nYes. Okay. Great. Maybe a quick follow-up here for Denis just on the equity investments line. Not a great quarter there, not a drag either. It feels like it's been some time since we've seen maybe a more normal quarter without big puts and takes. And so just given the reconstitution of that book, how would you frame what a more normal quarter should look like from a revenue perspective? And then how the private portfolio is positioned if we are moving into a better exit environment? Obviously, it's been tough there as well.\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSo a couple of things, and it may have been embedded in your question, but obviously, looking at some of the progress in the equity investment line on a sequential basis. Just a reminder that in Q4 when we sold Personal Financial Management, that was reflected as a gain in equity investments, about $350 million. That did not repeat. So that will give you some insight into how that's trending sequentially. \r\nOn a year-over-year basis, we are seeing performance in the private portfolio sort of in line with what you're suggesting we might expect. But we did see a particular markdown in the public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate equity investment results. We also, as you know, have been focused on selling down a portion of our historical principal investments. So a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio, combined with what the market conditions are, will obviously contribute to the ultimate performance. \r\nThe other guidance that we've put out there, generally medium-term guidance, is that across both equity and debt investments, you're looking at a number of about $2 billion on a year. So you put that in the quarter, about $500 million. Those are some pieces of color I'd give you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\n\nMatthew Derek O'Connor\n\nActually, just a follow-up on the last question and comment. The runoff of the historical principal investment from the $15 billion here. The $2 billion that you just referenced, is that the runoff that you expect? Or was that alluding to the revenues per year?\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSure. Thanks. Let me clarify. I was making a comment with respect to revenue. And then separately, as it relates to the rundown in that portfolio, I guess the way to think of it, picking up questions from last earnings and/or this one, the progress that we made in the first quarter of roughly $1.5 billion, we think that's a decent assumption for the pace over the course of this year. And then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all of it in line with our target.\n\nMatthew Derek O'Connor\n\nOkay. So $1.5 billion per quarter is what you're implying from here for the rest of the year?\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nOn the historical principal investment portfolio, yes, we would expect something roughly in line with $1.5 billion per quarter for the balance of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Saul Martinez with HSBC.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nWanted to ask about your financing business in markets. And obviously, there's uncertainty about the Basel endgame proposal. As you mentioned, the direction of travel seems to be -- for it to be materially lightened or even reproposed. But one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other jurisdictions is in securities financing, the risk weightings for unlisted entities. \r\nIf that part of the proposal isn't materially altered, and it doesn't seem like it necessarily is a focus, does that impact your ability to grow your financing revenues? Is it a threat? Is it not a big deal? Can you offset it through pricing, product design? Just curious if you could provide a little color on that.\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSure. So obviously, where Basel III ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how they're drafted and how they're calculated, et cetera, will be highly determinative. But I'd say the breadth of our financing activities across both FICC and equity are much broader than that particular component. And we expect that the underlying demand from our clients for financing across both FICC and equities will remain high. We have leading market shares and capabilities there, so we'll expect to be able to deliver in that regard. And depending on where various pieces of regulation end up, we'll make whatever adjustments we need either to pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on Basel and the implications of it being soft. And Denis, you mentioned more flexibility on capital deployment, and given the direction of travel on Basel. I mean, how should we be thinking about buyback activity from here? You did $1.5 billion. Is there -- do you feel like there is scope to increase that and potentially bring your payout ratio even closer to 100% of earnings?\n\nDenis P. Coleman\n\nSure. I appreciate the question. We were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital flexibility that we expected, but also pick up on something that David said earlier on the call, which is that we remain very committed to our capital deployment hierarchy, which starts with our client franchise. And some of the activities where historically we've been able to deploy capital have been less active. \r\nAnd so we have a good amount of cushion and flexibility at this point in time. As our clients become more active, the first place that we're going to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities. And then after that, we would, of course, as you know, continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend. And only after that would we think about return of capital.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Earnings Per Share (EPS): Reported $11.58, significantly exceeding the estimated $8.56. Net Income: Reported $4.13 billion, surpassing the estimated $2.95 billion. Revenue: Reported $14.21 billion, outperforming the estimated $12.92 billion. Annualized Return on Equity (ROE): A strong 14.8%, showcasing efficient equity utilization. Segment Growth: Notable revenue increase across all business segments compared to the previous year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) released its first-quarter earnings for 2024 with a remarkable performance that significantly outpaced analyst expectations. The company reported a substantial increase in earnings per share (EPS) at $11.58, which is a striking surge from the estimated $8.56. Net income for the quarter reached $4.13 billion, eclipsing the forecasted $2.95 billion. Total revenue for the quarter stood at $14.21 billion, again surpassing the analyst projections of $12.92 billion.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 CEO says AI is driving more companies to reinvent themselves: \u2018We\u2019re talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented\u2019",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs reported its first-quarter earnings on Monday and surprised analysts with a standout showing. Profits at the Wall Street giant surged 28% from a year ago, bolstered by a 32% rise in investment banking fees. In the company\u2019s follow-up conference call with analysts, CEO David Solomon provided some color about the growth in Goldman\u2019s business\u2014and his comments were likely well received by AI bulls.\n\nHe noted Goldman is already working with clients to discuss how\u2014and when\u2014the new technology will impact their businesses, the labor market, or the regulatory landscape. Solomon also said that over the longer term, he believes there will be significant demand for AI-related reorganizations and infrastructure projects, and therefore financing, which will be a tailwind for Goldman\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cI actually think there\u2019s a very, very constructive runway of opportunity sets for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses\u2014and we\u2019re talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented,\u201d he told analysts. \u201cI think that opportunity is \u2026 not a quarter-to-quarter thing\u2014this is over the next five to 10 years\u2014and we\u2019re very, very focused on it and very engaged.\u201d\n\nSolomon also noted that it\u2019s not just companies driving the rise of AI, as governments are getting involved in a big way, \u201cmaking enormous investments in bringing infrastructure into their locales.\u201d\n\nGovernment spending on AI is something that tech bulls like Erika Klauer, a technology equity portfolio manager at Jennison Associates, previously told Fortune will help boost a few key AI-linked stocks for years to come. \u201c[Nation-states] would like to have their own version of ChatGPT, with training on their own languages \u2026 their own archives, their own cultural nuances,\u201d she explained last month. \u201cAnd so those governments are coming to search out their own AI initiatives\u2014and that is an extraordinary opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe opportunities within AI are so huge\u2014and so widely talked about\u2014that analysts asked Goldman\u2019s Solomon about comparisons to the dotcom era of the late \u201990s and early 2000s on the firm\u2019s conference call Monday.\n\nThe CEO refused to comment on that comparison, but he did note that large tech companies are dominating the AI run so far. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of stock market capitalization that is being driven by big platforms that have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies,\u201d he said.\n\nSolomon also said that Goldman, like most major corporations, is expanding its use of AI in-house. The CEO sees \u201cenormous opportunities\u201d for productivity and efficiency gains at the company resulting from AI, but \u201clike with any emerging technology, a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial,\u201d he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe risks of using AI were also on fellow CEO Walter Bettinger II\u2019s mind as he answered analysts\u2019 questions on Charles Schwab\u2019s conference call Monday. He believes AI is a huge opportunity for the economy, his clients, and his business, but there are serious risks to take into account\u2014like AI\u2019s tendency to hallucinate\u2014and the hype may be a bit overdone.\n\nCompanies, particularly financial companies, will have a lot of work to do with regulators before they can use AI \u201cwithout inherent biases you sometimes see,\u201d according to Bettinger.\n\n\u201cWhen you switch over to something like generative AI, I think it\u2019s going to be a while to watch that technology mature. I know that may not match some of the hype that we hear some speaking of, but I think that technology will need to mature,\u201d he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Stellantis is renaming its new Milano sports utility vehicle as the Junior.\n\nThe change came after Adolfo Urso, Italy\u2019s industry minister, said on Thursday:\n\nA car called Milano cannot be produced in Poland. This is forbidden by Italian law \u2026 This law stipulates that you cannot give indications that mislead consumers. So a car called Milano must be produced in Italy.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Alfa Romeo\u2019s boss, Jean-Philippe Imparato, said today:\n\nWe decided to change the name, even though we know that we are not required to do so, because we want to preserve the positive emotion that our products have always generated and avoid any type of controversy.\n\n05:44 PM BST\n\nWave of retirement is starving UK stocks of pension fund investment, warns Goldman Sachs\n\nBritish businesses risk being starved of investment as pension funds sell off assets to meet a wave of retirement claims, Goldman Sachs has warned. Tim Wallace has the details:\n\nAnalysts at the Wall Street bank have sounded the alarm over investment levels flatlining in the UK after research found final salary schemes are selling almost as many British stocks as other pension funds are buying.\n\nThis has meant that UK-listed companies are receiving just \u00a3500m in net investment from pension funds each year.\n\nGoldman Sachs said defined benefit (DB) schemes \u2013 which pay a fixed income but are largely closed to new savers \u2013 are selling \u00a32.5bn of shares per quarter to pay out pensions to retirees.\n\nAt the same time, defined contribution (DC) pensions \u2013 which do not guarantee a specific income but depend on the performance of financial markets \u2013 are buying \u00a33bn of equities over the same period.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of this net investment is being ploughed into foreign stock markets, with only a quarter being diverted to British stocks.\n\nIn the 1990s, final salary schemes owned half of all UK shares, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nBy comparison, they now hold just 3pc after years of transferring funds to bonds, property and other assets deemed to be lower-risk.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:28 PM BST\n\nSuperdry to push for big rent cuts in restructuring\n\nSuperdry is to push for steep cuts in the rents it pays as it struggles to shore up its shaky finances.\n\nSky News has reported that the fashion retailer is planning to publish a formal restructuring plan this week focused on cutting rents. It is understood that it is not planning to close any shops but that landlords could terminate the leases if they are unhappy with the plan.\n\nSuperdry shares dropped nearly 6pc this afternoon on the news. They have lost more than 90pc of their value over the past year.\n\nSuperdry\u2019s most recently filed accounts reported a loss of \u00a3148.1m on revenues of \u00a3622.5m.\n\nSuperdry said it \u201cconfirms it is in the advanced stages of preparing a restructuring plan which is expected to launch in the coming days. However, there is no certainty that such a restructuring plan will be implemented\u201d.

Eir Nols\u00f8e has more:\n\nThe FTSE 250-listed company on Monday confirmed it had cut 100 jobs since the start of the year, taking the total reduction in its staffing numbers over the past 12 months to 900.\n\nHiring remained muted in the UK, the US and Asia, while it deteriorated further in Continental Europe. The recruiter blamed the slump on bosses and candidates being anxious about taking risks.\n\nNicholas Kirk, chief executive of PageGroup, said: \u201cCandidate and client sentiment remains subdued reflecting the general macroeconomic uncertainty in most of our markets.\u201d\n\n60 jobs were axed in the UK, with profits at its British division plunging by nearly a fifth over the past year to \u00a327.1m.\n\nAfter a heated war for talent coming out of the pandemic, job listings in the UK have fallen significantly over the last year and unemployment has edged up. It has coincided with a rapid rise in interest rates to their highest level in 16 years.\n\nThe UK fell into recession at the end of 2023, though economists believe it is likely to have been a short and shallow downturn.\n\nWhile the hiring downturn is bad news for recruiters, policymakers at the Bank of England are likely to feel pleased.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s rate-setters are closely studying wage growth to judge when they can start bringing down interest rates from a 16-year-high of 5.25pc. Job moves are a key source of pay rises and a tailing off in recruitment will help to soften upward pressure on wages.\n\n03:58 PM BST\n\nGerman airline giant Lufthansa offers \u2018frustrating\u2019 update, says analyst\n\nSusannah Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown, says that the hefty first-quarter at Lufthansa is unexpected:\n\nThe cost of strikes has taken a big toll on Lufthansa, which has recorded a greater underlying loss than expected. Industrial action at the group and its partners dented earnings by around \u20ac350m.\n\nThere will also be disappointment that even though strikes are in the rear-view mirror and normal flight services have resumed, there won\u2019t be a big ramp up in capacity in the second quarter, partly due to efforts to improve punctuality and delays in new aircraft deliveries.\n\nIt\u2019s a frustrating update for shareholders, with the share price falling 3pc.

US-produced West Texas Intermediate slipped by 1.1pc below $85.\n\nMarkets have been relatively unmoved after Iran unleashed more than 300 ballistic and cruise missiles and attack drones late Saturday. Most were repelled by Israel\u2019s air defences.\n\nTehran said the aerial strike was a legitimate response to a deadly attack on an Iranian embassy building in Damascus that it blames on Israel.

Revolut declined to comment on the valuation.\n\nYet it signals an easing of investor concerns about valuations in the sector after a year when multiple start-ups suffered write-downs and share prices among listed companies fell sharply.\n\nNear-zero interest rates caused valuations to balloon as easy access to capital fuelled investments in financial technology businesses. However, investors later grew cold on the sector as rising interest rates weighed on the availability of venture capital funding.

He said:\n\nWe estimate that oil prices already reflect a $5-to-$10-a-barrel risk premium from downside risks to supply.\n\nThe potential Israeli response to Iran\u2019s attack is highly uncertain and will likely determine the extent of threat to regional oil supply.\n\nHe added that Iranian crude production has risen by more than 20pc over the past two years to 3.4m barrels a day, or about 3.3pc of global supply.\n\n\u201cIf the market were to price a higher probability of reduced Iran supply, then this could contribute to a higher geopolitical risk premium,\u201d he added.\n\n07:37 AM BST\n\nOil prices could hit $100 if Israel-Iran conflict escalates, warns City\n\nOil prices could surge above $100 a barrel - a level which could raise petrol prices for drivers - if the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, City analysts have warned.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, has slipped below $90, having initially risen to $91.05 a barrel after Tehran launched drone strikes late on Saturday.\n\nOil prices climbed close to six-week highs last week as markets prepared for a potential retaliation by Iran to a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy in Syria earlier this month.\n\nAnalysts at Citi warned that its base case for the near future is for tensions to remain \u201cextremely high\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nAnalyst Max Layton wrote in a note to clients: \u201cWhat is not priced into the current market, in our view, is a potential continuation of a direct conflict between Iran and Israel, which we estimate could see oil prices trade up to +$100/bbl, depending on the nature of the events.\u201d\n\nA rise in prices to more than $100 a barrel would risk raising petrol prices for drivers.\n\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: \u201cIf the price of oil was to reach $95 a barrel, we could see petrol at the pump go back up to 150p a litre which would be bad news for hard-pressed drivers.\u201d\n\n07:28 AM BST\n\nJapan stocks slump amid Middle East tensions\n\nTokyo stocks closed lower after Iran\u2019s unprecedented missile and drone strikes on Israel raised fears of wider conflict in the region.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 0.7pc, or 290.75 points, to end at 39,232.80, while the broader Topix index gave up 0.2pc, or 6.44 points, to 2,753.20.\n\n07:26 AM BST\n\nInchcape to sell UK car dealerships to US rival\n\nIn corporate news, car dealership firm Inchcape is to sell its UK retail operations for around \u00a3346m.\n\nThe company said it has sealed a deal to sell the operation, which employs 3,600 people across more than 80 sites, to US-based rival Group 1 Automotive.\n\nIt comes after London-listed Inchcape said it was reviewing options for the UK business, including a possible sale, after \u201capproaches from a number of interested parties\u201d.\n\nDuncan Tait, group chief executive of Inchcape, said:\n\nWith our active international expansion into higher value distribution activities, the strategic importance of the UK retail operations has become limited.\n\nThe board has therefore concluded it is the right time for a new owner to take this business forward.\n\n07:21 AM BST\n\nGold near record high after Iran attack on Israel\n\nGold prices rose as traders sought safe havens after Iran\u2019s retaliatory attack on Israel stoked fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThe flight to safety sent gold up more than 0.5pc to $2,356.39 an ounce, close to its record high of $2,369.32.\n\n07:17 AM BST\n\nCameron: It\u2019s right for Israel not to escalate\n\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron said \u201cit is right for Israel not to escalate\u201d after Iran\u2019s unprecedented attack on Israel.\n\nHe told Times Radio:\n\nIsrael has every right to respond as an independent sovereign country being attacked in this way.\n\nBut I think we\u2019re very anxious to avoid escalation and to say to our friends in Israel it\u2019s a time to think with with head as well as heart.\n\nAnd in many ways this is a double defeat for Iran. Not only was their attack an almost total failure, but also the rest of the world can now see what a malign influence they are in the region and understand their true nature.\n\nAnd so I think it is right for Israel not to escalate, but obviously they\u2019re a sovereign, independent country and they\u2019ll make their own decisions.\n\n07:15 AM BST\n\nOil falls despite rising tensions in the Middle East\n\nOil prices have fallen despite the increasing tensions in the Middle East following Iran\u2019s unprecedented attack on Israel.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, has slipped 39 cents but remains above $90, having initially risen to $91.05 a barrel after Tehran launched drone strikes late on Saturday.\n\nOil prices climbed close to six-week highs last week as markets prepared for a potential retaliation by Iran to a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy in Syria earlier this month.\n\nThe attack over the weekend marked the first time Iran had ever launched a military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nStephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile the drone attack has grabbed headlines, its immediate impact on global markets, particularly oil prices and inflation concerns, may be subdued.\n\n\u201cThe precision and limited lethal impact of Iran\u2019s response suggest a strategic approach aimed at minimising damage rather than escalating tensions.\u201d\n\nThe limited reaction of oil prices to Iran\u2019s assault comes as markets had a little over a week to adjust to the potential for rising tensions in the Middle East - and amid diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflict.\n\nIran said its attacks were in response to a suspected Israeli strike on its Syrian embassy which took place on April 1.\n\nUS President Joe Biden was reported to have cautioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \u201ctake the win\u201d and forego a counterattack.\n\nExperts said the limited scope of the attack showed Iran was seeking to make a show of strength with its attack, but without sparking a conflict.\n\nHebe Chen, an analyst at IG Markets, said:\n\nThe muted market response likely stems from the highly intricate sentiment in the market at this stage.\n\nMarket participants are certainly not giving up hope that the past weekend\u2019s events were just a one-off occurrence, while holding their breath for what could happen next.\n\nHelima Croft at RBC Capital Markets said: \u201cThis war may move down the escalation ladder if the Israeli government follows the advice of the White House and forgoes retaliatory action.\u201d\n\n07:07 AM BST\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me. Oil prices have fallen despite Iran ramping up Middle East tensions by launching a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend, fuelling fears of a wider conflict in the volatile region.\n\nWhile Israel called the attack an escalation of hostilities, analysts said there was hope among traders that the crisis could be contained.\n\nThat sliver of optimism helped drag oil prices lower.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Drivers face petrol price rise as Middle East crisis deepens | Cost at the pump could jump to \u00a31.50 a litre within weeks, warns RAC\n\n2) Benefits system \u2018not designed\u2019 for Britain\u2019s 2.3m long-term sick | Reforms announced by Tories will not go far enough, warns Resolution Foundation\n\n3) BAE pushes to delay Royal Navy frigate to prioritise Norway deal | Bid to sell submarine-hunting warships to Norway hinges on Royal Navy accepting delays\n\n4) More than half of heat pump grant cash still unclaimed | Increase in funding to \u00a37,500 per household fails to spark uptake\n\n5) The coming days are critical for Britain\u2019s economic fortunes | Bank of England doesn\u2019t always follow in the Fed\u2019s footsteps, writes Roger Bootle\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nAsian stocks tumbled overnight after Iran ramped up Middle East tensions by launching a barrage of rockets at Israel over the weekend, fuelling fears of a wider conflict in the volatile region.\n\nJapan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 1pc in morning trading to 39,114.19.\n\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.6pc to 7,743.80.

        "title": "First Quarter Bank Earnings Brought The Revival That Wall Street Needed",
        "content": "First Quarter Bank Earnings Brought The Revival That Wall Street Needed\n\nThe first quarter reports officially kicked off with bank earnings, as usual. On Friday, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) opened the season, reporting strong results. On Monday, they were joined by The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) who also posted better than expected earnings due to a rebound in global M&A activity that fueled revenue for its biggest division.\n\nWells Fargo topped estimates with first quarter profit.\n\nWells Fargo reported revenue rose less than 1% YoY to $20.86 billion, but still topped FactSet\u2019s estimates of $20.2 billion. On the other hand, its net income declined 7% YoY to $4.62 billion or $1.20 per share, but also still surpassed analyst estimates of\u00a0$1.06.\u00a0Adjusted profit of $1.26 per share\u00a0also surpassed LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.11. However, Wells Fargo\u2019s legal problem is still pending as at the end of February, the bank that\u00a0spent years trying to extricate itself from its fake accounts scandal, got sued for not doing enough to help harmed customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase surpassed earnings estimates, but one of its key profit metrics declined on a sequential basis.\n\nFor the first quarter,\u00a0JPMorgan reported revenue rose\u00a08% to $42.55 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$41.85 billion\u00a0as interest income\u00a0rose on the back of\u00a0higher rates and larger loan balances.\n\nThanks to its\u00a0takeover of First Republic, JPMorgan recorded a\u00a0profit rise of\u00a06%\u00a0as earnings amounted to\u00a0$13.42 billion, or $4.44 per share, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$4.11.\u00a0Although\u00a0JPMorgan Chase reported\u00a0net interest income rose 11% to $23.2 billion,\u00a0it also contracted\u00a04% on a sequential basis\u00a0due to margin compression and lower deposit balances.\n\nCitigroup wrapped up its organizational simplification\u00a0and started 2024 on a good note.\n\nFor the first quarter, Citigroup posted revenue dropped 2% YoY to\u00a0$21.1 billion,\u00a0surpassing\u00a0Fact Set\u2019s estimate of $20.4 billion. Revenue contracted mostly as the result of last year\u2019s sale of the overseas division. Due to higher expenses and credit costs,\u00a0profit\u00a0also contracted\u00a027%\u00a0YoY\u00a0$3.37 billion, or $1.58 a share. Excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items, adjusted earnings amounted to\u00a0$1.86 per share,\u00a0also surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.23. Most importantly, Citiroup finalized its organizational simplification last month and is now operating under a\u00a0cleaner management structure.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs delivered better-than expected results after a challenging year.\n\nFor the first quarter, Goldman Sachs reported revenues rose 16.3% to $14.21 billion, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s forecasts of\u00a0$12.92 billion\u00a0as investment banking fees rose\u00a032%. The\u00a0Global Banking & Markets division\u00a0that covers\u00a0fixed-income\u00a0trading and M&A activity,\u00a0reported a\u00a0revenue rise\u00a0of\u00a015%, bringing\u00a0as much as\u00a0$9.73 billion\u00a0to the revenue table. According to LSEG data, overall deal volumes\u00a0of global M&A activity\u00a0rose\u00a030%\u00a0YoY during the quarter to\u00a0just over $755 billion.\u00a0Profits rose\u00a028%\u00a0as net income\u00a0amounted to\u00a0$4.1 billion or $11.58 per share, also surpassing FactSet's\u00a0expectation of\u00a0$8.56 per share.\n\nWith the first quarter results, banks kicked off 2024 with some much-needed momentum fueled by\u00a0a\u00a0still-buoyant U.S. economy. But the banking giants also provided a conservative guidance with banking executives emphasizing the uncertainty that lies ahead from macroeconomic, geopolitical, structural, and regulatory challenges despite improved conditions.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "City of London\n\nBritish businesses risk being starved of investment as pension funds sell off assets to meet a wave of retirement claims, Goldman Sachs has warned.\n\nAnalysts at the Wall Street bank have sounded the alarm over investment levels flatlining in the UK after research found final salary schemes are selling almost as many British stocks as other pension funds are buying.\n\nThis has meant that UK-listed companies are receiving just \u00a3500m in net investment from pension funds each year.\n\nGoldman Sachs said defined benefit (DB) schemes \u2013 which pay a fixed income but are largely closed to new savers \u2013 are selling \u00a32.5bn of shares per quarter to pay out pensions to retirees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the same time, defined contribution (DC) pensions \u2013 which do not guarantee a specific income but depend on the performance of financial markets \u2013 are buying \u00a33bn of equities over the same period.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of this net investment is being ploughed into foreign stock markets, with only a quarter being diverted to British stocks.\n\nIn the 1990s, final salary schemes owned half of all UK shares, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nBy comparison, they now hold just 3pc after years of transferring funds to bonds, property and other assets deemed to be lower-risk.\n\nDC schemes, which are growing in number, typically put a greater share of their investments in equities compared to DB schemes, which are shrinking.\n\nHowever, the Goldman Sachs report warned this does not mean British shares should expect a boost in the coming years.\n\nAnalyst Sharon Bell said: \u201cEven if DC funds \u2013 which tend to allocate much more to equity \u2013 become the dominant part of the pension pie, we might still find a lack of [demand] for domestic stocks from this source.\n\n\u201cIncentives to capture these assets for UK investment along with a compelling equity-market growth story would be needed to change this. Of course, this is somewhat circular; there is a need for domestic investors/ownership in order to deepen the capital market and encourage new companies to list.\u201d\n\nThe Government is trying to address this with a range of new policies, including a British ISA that allows savers a bigger tax-free pot if they invest in UK-listed shares.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the ISA\u2019s extra \u00a35,000 allowance will \u201censure that British savers can benefit from the growth of the most promising UK businesses as well as supporting them with the capital to help them expand\u201d.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Goldman Sachs said it saw a double digit rise in its first quarter profits on Monday, lifted broadly by the stock and bond markets' performances in the first months of the year.\n\nThe strong quarter comes after Goldman struggled most of 2023 as higher interest rates put a pause on companies doing deals and mergers. But as executives have adjusted to the new normal and interest rates appear to be heading lower, Goldman has benefitted from the change in attitude.\n\nThe New York-based investment bank posted a profit of $4.13 billion, up 28% from a year earlier. The company earned $11.67 a share for the quarter, well above analysts expectations.\n\nMost of Goldman's underlying businesses had a strong quarterly performance. Investment banking fees were up 32% in the quarter at $2.08 billion. The bank said most of the growth was driven in debt underwriting, likely as a result of higher interest rates requiring companies to refinance their bonds and debt.\n\nTrading in Goldman's fixed income, currencies and commodities department rose 10% in the quarter, with revenues of $4.32 billion. Stock trading revenues were also up 10%.\n\nIn Goldman's asset management business, where the bank manages money for the wealthy and large companies and foundations, revenues were up 18%.\n\nGoldman\u2019s return on equity, a measure how well an investment bank does with its underlying assets, was 14.8% on an annualized basis. Banks like Goldman typically want to keep this metric above 10%.\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs were up more than 3% in morning trading.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) came out with quarterly earnings of $11.58 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.54 per share. This compares to earnings of $8.79 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 35.60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment bank would post earnings of $3.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.48, delivering a surprise of 57.93%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nGoldman , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, posted revenues of $14.21 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $12.22 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nGoldman shares have added about 1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.4%.\n\nWhat's Next for Goldman?\n\nWhile Goldman has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Goldman: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $8.27 on $12.65 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $32.76 on $50.31 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - Investment Bank is currently in the top 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nRaymond James Financial, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $3.1 billion, up 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs profit rose 28% in the first quarter, buoyed by a recovery in debt underwriting and dealmaking that boosted its investment banking unit, it reported on Monday.\n\nProfit rose to $4.13 billion, or $11.58 per share, for the three months ended March 31, compared with $3.23 billion, or $8.79 per share, a year ago.\n\n\"We continue to execute on our strategy, focusing on our core strengths to serve our clients and deliver for our shareholders,\" CEO David Solomon said.\n\nExecutives at rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup cited improving conditions for dealmaking on Friday when the lenders reported profits that beat market expectations.\n\nAs a leading advisor for mergers and acquisitions, Goldman has advised on some of last year's biggest deals, including Exxon Mobil's $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources.\n\nWith corporations regaining some confidence to raise money in capital markets, equity and bond underwriting business rebounded.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has so far managed to steer the economy toward a so-called soft landing, in which it raises interest rates and tames inflation while avoiding a major downturn.\n\nHigher fees from underwriting debt and stock offerings as well as advising on deals lifted Goldman's investment banking fees up 32% to $2.08 billion.\n\nRevenue from trading in fixed income, currencies and commodities rose 10% to $4.32 billion, while equities revenue jumped 10% to $3.31 billion.\n\nGlobal volume of mergers and acquisitions climbed 30% in the first quarter to about $755.1 billion from a year ago, according to data from Dealogic.\n\nPlatform solutions, the unit that houses some of Goldman's consumer operations, garnered 24% higher revenue.\n\nGoldman is slimming down its ill-fated consumer banking operations after they lost billions of dollars. It has already taken big writedowns on GreenSky, a home improvement lender it bought and sold two years later.\n\nCEO Solomon, who once championed the retail push, has drawn criticism for the strategy.\n\nTop proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged shareholders to vote for the bank to split its chairman and CEO roles, both of which are currently held by Solomon. ISS cited his \"missteps and steep losses\" in a report to investors.\n\nGoldman has also scrapped its co-branded credit cards with General Motors, and a similar partnership it has with tech giant Apple is facing an uncertain future.\n\nThe bank's provisions for credit losses jumped to $318 million compared to a net benefit of $171 million a year ago, due to potential defaults in credit cards and wholesale loans.\n\n(Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

Asset and wealth management revenues rose, as did trading.\n\nGoldman's stock rose 3% in premarket trading Monday.\n\nThe improved results follow a year that was the most challenging for Solomon since 2019, his first full year in charge.\n\nDealmaking slowed across Wall Street and he grappled with a costly exit from consumer banking and a series of high-profile departures from the firm. Goldman CEO David Solomon. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe pressure on Solomon hasn\u2019t let up in 2024. Two prominent proxy advisory firms are advising stockholders to cast votes this month that would limit the power of Solomon, with results due to be tallied at the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 24.\n\nThe proposal that garnered a stamp of approval from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Co. would split the CEO and chairman roles, both currently occupied by Solomon. A similar proposal last year did not pass, winning only 16% of votes.\n\nGlass Lewis is separately suggesting that stockholders also vote against Goldman\u2019s executive pay plan due to a \"significant disconnect between pay and performance.\" ISS provided \"cautionary support\" for the executive pay plan.\n\nSolomon\u2019s 2023 compensation rose 24% \u2014 to $31 million \u2014 despite a profit decline of the same amount.\n\nNot only is that up from the $25 million he was awarded in 2022, it is more than his rivals Brian Moynihan, Charles Scharf, and Jane Fraser made at Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C).\n\nOnly JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and outgoing Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman were awarded more for their 2023 performance.\n\nA lot is in flux at Goldman as key executives depart, raising new questions about the race to eventually succeed Solomon.\n\nOne surprise exit in 2024 is Jim Esposito, who had been co-head of Goldman\u2019s global banking and markets division and is leaving after nearly three decades. Esposito had been viewed on Wall Street as among the possible successors to Solomon.\n\nAnother recent departure in March was Stephanie Cohen, global head of its platform solutions division.\n\nEven the board of Goldman is changing. This year, ex-Goldman CFO David Viniar was appointed as the board\u2019s lead director to replace Adebayo Ogunlesi, who announced he would step down after selling his infrastructure investment company to BlackRock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first quarter results could help Solomon as he prepares to face shareholders later this month. The surge in investment banking included a 24% rise in advisory fees, a 38% jump in debt underwriting and a 45% increase in equity underwriting fees.\n\nTrading revenues from fixed income and equities were also both up 10% from a year ago.\n\n\"Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of Goldman Sachs,\" Solomon said in a press release.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Oil prices dipped on Monday following increased tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend. (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nOil (BZ=F, CL=F)\n\nOil prices tracked lower on Monday morning in European trading hours, as markets digest news of Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend. Comments from Israeli officials suggest the conflict is \"not over\" as market watchers wait to see what will happen.\n\nMoney was taken off the table following a near-six month high of $92.18 for Brent crude last week. Crude futures headed 0.9% lower, to trade at $84.87 (\u00a363.08) a barrel, while Brent crude was 0.8% lower and trading at $89.74.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets mixed amid rising tensions in the Middle East\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIran said it had launched drones and missiles towards Israel in retaliation for a 1 April attack on its consulate in Damascus, Syria.

Since then, bitcoin's price has risen from around $42,000 to above $66,300 today.\n\nThe digital asset was trading more than 3% higher by mid-morning on Monday.

        "title": "10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most undervalued value stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and undervalued stocks, then you can check out 5 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAmong the several categories that stocks can be divided into, two categories are value stocks and growth stocks. They stand on the opposite end of the spectrum and cater to investors with different kinds of risk appetite and goals. These stocks are defined primarily through the price to earnings ratio, which measures the premium that the stock market is paying over the firm's ability to make a profit. The higher the ratio is, the more a stock can be said to be a 'growth' stock and vice versa, with the industry in which the value stock or growth stock belongs also playing a crucial role as different sectors often have wildly varying P/E ratios.\n\nInvestors who pile into growth stocks do so to grow their money. A stock with a high P/E ratio shows that the market believes that it will grow its earnings significantly in the future and is therefore willing to bet on this future growth in the present. On the flip side, value stocks are for those investors who just want to place their money in a stable security and just forget about it. As opposed to growth stocks, whose high P/E ratio comes with the risk of significant share price drop in case of an untoward event, value stocks are relatively insulated since investors have not paid a hefty premium over their earnings. One exception to this statement is value traps which are stocks with strong current earnings but negative earnings growth rates. Value traps may look cheap but investors face significant capital destruction risk.\n\nThis fundamental difference between value stocks and growth stocks is most often based on their business models. So say, one example of a value stock, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), is unlikely to be perceived by investors to leave a blazing trail in its wake of pursuing high technology innovation. On the flip side, investors of the eCommerce behemoth Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), rightly have high expectations from the firm when it comes to maintaining a foothold (or stronghold) in the high growth eCommerce market and artificial intelligence. This is also reflected in Amazon's forward and trailing P/E ratios which currently sit at 43.67 and 63.82, respectively. For more on growth stocks, you can check out 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother set of categories that stocks can be divided into are undervalued and overvalued stocks. In fact, stock valuation sits at the heart of an investing philosophy called Value Investing. This set of beliefs has found some highly successful adherents on Wall Street, with two notable ones being Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. At its heart, value investing involves determining the fair or true value of a stock and then comparing it with the market price. If the market price is lower, then an investing decision is made depending on the difference between the two called the margin of safety. The greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels with their decision as it reduces the amount of losses in case of the share price dropping in an untoward event. Stocks that have a fair value that is higher than the market value are called undervalued stocks, and those whose market price is higher are called overvalued stocks - with the market price being the primary determinant of the valuation adjective.\n\nThe next question to ask is, what constitutes a fair value of a stock? Well, one commonly used proxy for this is the analyst share price targets. Sell side financial firms such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) employ analysts whose sole job is to see what the value of a firm's stock can be based on different metrics such as future cash flows. Averaging these price targets aims to remove some of the biases present in a single analyst's analysis and it is often used as a proxy for fair value.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the most undervalued value stocks, we can check to see if investing in undervalued stocks has its merits or not. Well, we don't have to look too far to find a list of undervalued stocks. One such list is Insider Monkey's coverage of 14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now. This list used consensus undervalued stock picks of the financial media and was published in mid September 2023. The average six month share price performance of all the stocks on this list is 19.64% and ranges from 44.64% for Amazon to -22.77% for the lithium provider Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nAlbermarle has suffered amidst a glut in the global lithium industry that has been hurt from oversupply and slow demand, and here's what The London Company had to say about the firm in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nALB underperformed as weak lithium prices drove downward revisions to earnings expectations, and sentiment became more negative regarding demand for electric vehicles. Commodity prices are inherently uncertain, but we continue to view ALB as a winner in this growing industry and favorably positioned on the cost curve. Our long-term view of ALB is not affected by short-term supply-demand dynamics for the commodity.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most undervalued value stocks that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG). 10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued value stocks we first made a list of 40 stocks with P/E ratios under 15 and average analyst percentage share price upside greater than 20%. Then, the 20 stocks with the highest upside were selected, and they were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top stocks were selected.\n\nFor these undervalued value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\n10.

        "content": "In the current market scenario, the one sector that promises significant returns in the coming years is the tech sector. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the tech sector has been thriving, and tech stocks have been hitting new highs over the past few months. There is immense potential in the industry, and according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), AI-related investments will reach $200 billion globally by 2025. As the adoption of AI increases and it penetrates multiple industries, we will see companies report impressive numbers, and now is the time to watch out for AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe companies not adopting or investing in AI could end up losing a lot of business. The success of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is proof of the impact of AI in our world, and it is currently crowned the winner in the AI race. However, there is still a long way to go, and several companies are investing in AI to make the most of the hype. If you missed out on the chance to buy NVDA stock, here are seven AI stocks to buy if you want to make the most of the AI frenzy.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) enjoys an early-mover advantage of having invested in OpenAI and integrated AI into its products and services. It has a comprehensive approach to integrating AI in all the services, allowing for higher revenue and growth in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company has already achieved success with the cloud and is aiming to monetize through Microsoft Copilot. It has a subscription model, and the company has seen a massive rise in the number of subscribers, with over 1 million in October 2023. That will give a revenue boost to the company.\n\nI am certain its quarterly results will be impressive, and if you want to own only one tech stock, it has to be Microsoft. Up 14% year-to-date (YTD), MSFT stock will steadily keep moving higher, and the results could lead to a rally. The stock also pays a dividend and has a modest yield of 0.70%.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) has been making big moves lately and is on an aggressive expansion spree. It is building 100 data centers and launched the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform to offer cloud services to other companies. The company has recently signed a deal with Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) to combine their AI prowess.\n\nThe deal can be game-changing and improve the growth prospects of both companies. It also signed a contract with Nvidia, where both companies will market cloud offerings, AI chips and software. These deals show Oracle\u2019s strength to win the market. It has also reported impressive third-quarter results with a 7% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle also saw a 29% YOY jump in the order backlog. Trading at $123 today, the stock is up 18% YTD and 31% in the year. An established industry player, Oracle has all it takes to succeed in the thriving AI space.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the hottest tech companies right now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) plays a crucial role in expanding the AI industry. It is also a very important industry player for Nvidia since TSM makes most of the chips designed by Nvidia and the chips required to run AI technologies.\n\nThe company recently won $6.6 billion in government funding for chip production. That is aimed at increasing the company\u2019s manufacturing capacity in the U.S. The company will expand its investment in Arizona by $25 billion to $65 billion and is set to add a third plant in the state by 2030.\n\nTSMC\u2019s future looks bright, and the stock is already up 44% YTD. The company also reported the fastest monthly revenue growth since 2022, with sales hitting $6.1 billion in one month, up 34% YOY.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoaring higher than Nvidia, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is up 235% YTD and 785% on the year. Trading for $937 today, the stock might look expensive, but it is worth your money. Directly related to Nvidia, SMCI will grow whenever Nvidia does. It integrates its motherboard designs with Nvidia processors and is one of the best out there right now.\n\nWhile SMCI is heavily dependent on Nvidia, I believe it has one of the best liquid cooling products in the industry and it gets early access to Nvidia\u2019s chips. AI servers require the right cooling servers and that is where Super Micro Computer is set to benefit. It is looking at expanding production, which will help improve the financials.\n\nIt reported impressive financials in the fourth quarter, with net sales hitting $3.66 billion and EPS up 62%, hitting $5.10 per share. Analysts have a high price target for the stock, and the company has to live up to the expectations.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) isn\u2019t making as much noise in the AI industry as its counterparts, it is still gaining momentum. The company is working on an affordable AI chip and still has a strong hold on Google Search and Google Cloud. These are the two highest revenue-generating segments for the company and contribute to the business growth.\n\nOne big reason to invest in Alphabet is its sheer potential to innovate. It is working on the new Arm-based AI CPU, which could be a game changer for the business. Alphabet is a highly stable company with a rich history, and its solid market share makes it one of the best tech stocks to own.\n\nThe stock is up 15% YTD and is trading for $160 right now. It looks highly undervalued to me, and analysts say it could hit $185 very soon. Oppenheimer analysts set a price target of $185 for the stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), is slowly growing its AI products. It launched a series of microchips designed for AI applications and is ready to take on Nvidia.\n\nThe company launched the MI300X microchip, which will be used for servers and data centers. Some of the top tech companies, including Microsoft, have been buying these chips. AMD stock is up 18% YTD and exchanging hands for $170. It is up 80% in the year and could hit $200 very soon.\n\nIf you think Nvidia is too expensive, now is the time to grab AMD before it skyrockets. Considered an industry underdog, the market is highly optimistic about the future of AMD. It is looking for sales of $5.4 billion in the first quarter, and I believe it will report strong fundamentals. AMD has a history of excelling in the industry, and any dip in the stock is a chance to buy.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies has been crushing the market with its AI prowess. Up 35% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $22 and is on a rally. The stock has soared since February after the company reported impressive numbers driven by the artificial intelligence platform (AIP) boot camps.\n\nThe company is making the most of the rising demand for cloud and has integrated AI into its products. It signed 103 deals worth at least $1 million in the fourth quarter and has a backlog of boot camps. Palantir saw a 70% YOY increase in commercial revenue in the quarter and a 55% rise in consumer count.\n\nAs mentioned above, Palantir\u2019s partnership with Oracle is set to benefit the business, as its applications will be available through Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure. I wrote about Palantir earlier and believe it has the potential to double your money. Considering the high demand for AI in the industry, Palantir is set to have an exceptional 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The emergence of artificial intelligence stands as a force ready to transform several prominent industries. Investors looking to seize a rare chance to capitalize on these gains have aimed their efforts at leading semiconductor stocks to quadruple their money. Such a move clearly makes sense.\n\nDemand for high-powered AI chips powering self-driving cars and medical diagnosis continues to soar. This growth isn\u2019t hype \u2014 2024 forecasts unprecedented market expansion. AI demands advanced chip structures for data handling and computations. These stocks enable investors to profit from AI\u2019s explosive growth.\n\nSemiconductors revolutionize modern life. Consider investing in semiconductor stocks in April as long-term bets. These are three of the top players in the sector that I don\u2019t think get enough love. Accordingly, those looking for a more diversified chips portfolio should look at the stocks investors are looking at now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst off the list is the Asian semiconductor company Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The company\u2019s Q1 earnings were recently released, and these numbers impressed investors with Taiwan Semi\u2019s excellent results.\n\nTSMC stock surged as the company reported 16.5% sales growth on a year-over-year basis. The company\u2019s March-quarter sales hit $18.86 billion, easily surpassing estimates of $18.26 billion. Previous-year sales were $16.62 billion, signaling strong growth over time. TSMC\u2019s Q1 revenue rebounded after four quarters of decline. Clients include some of the most prominent names in this space, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAnalyst Charles Shi maintained a buy rating for TSM stock, raising his price target to $168 from R133. He cited TSMC\u2019s strength in AI and said that despite the impact of an earthquake, the company expects to meet its full-year growth target. Shi predicts a Q3 recovery, and I\u2019m in line with this view.\n\nThe company also holds 50% of the contract chip manufacturing market to add to this thesis.\u00a0 It dominates the highest-performing computing sector. Alongside AMD, Nvidia and Broadcom, TSMC also shares the success of AI chips as these companies rely on TSMC. With cutting-edge chip tech like 3nm and upcoming 2nm processes, TSMC drives AI innovation. Bullish forecasts predict over 20% revenue growth in FY24. Expanding with new plants in Germany and Japan, TSMC leads the AI revolution.\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nPredicted to have an upward trajectory until 2027, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a semiconductor stock every investor should have in their portfolio right now. Analysts predict a 25% rise to $1,215 per share by 2025. Progression suggests $1,500 in 2026 and nearly $1,900 by 2027, doubling the current value. ASML\u2019s dominance in chip technology, especially EUV lithograph, which is crucial for AI, supports this potential growth.\n\nBased in the Netherlands, the company revolutionizes semiconductor production for Intel and TSMC using EUV light, creating ultra-thin lines on silicon. Its lithography dominance, shielded by patents, faces challenges from espionage and trade disputes.\n\nASML\u2019s future shines bright, particularly in lithography. Mordor Intelligence forecasts over 11% annual growth for EUV lithography through 2029. Demand for high-performance chips, essential for AI, fuels ASML\u2019s prospects, with Taiwan Semiconductor as a critical client. Moreover, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst\u2019s note highlights favorable risk/reward in ASML, driven by AI momentum.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently upgraded by analysts, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) excels in semiconductor and display equipment, favored by JPMorgan(NYSE:JPM) with a $260 price target. Strategic positioning and tech advancements, like HBM and GAA, position the company well for market share growth in a projected $110 billion market by 2025. Q1 results surpassed forecasts, underlining its market strength and strategic accuracy.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald also upgraded Applied Materials to overweight, raising their price target to $260 per share. Expectations of a strong semiconductor equipment market drove this shift. Applied Materials\u2019 strategic position and tech advancements, including HBM and GAA transistors, fuel optimism for market share growth.\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 GAAP earnings were $2.41 per share, exceeding the non-GAAP $2.13. Despite a slight sales decline from Q1 2023, improved gross and operating margins led to a 19% year-over-year profit increase. Services segment profitability, notably, rose significantly, aiding overall profitability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Could Be a Great Choice",
        "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\n\nGoldman Sachs in Focus\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 3.04% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $2.75 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.77%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.49%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.58%.\n\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $11 is up 4.8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 26.83%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 48%. This means it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nEarnings growth looks solid for GS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $33.13 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 44.86%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Billionaire Leon Cooperman\u2019s Family, Children and Investments",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at billionaire Leon Cooperman's family, children and investments. If you want to skip our detailed overview of one of the most successful billionaires in Wall Street history, then you can skip ahead to Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Family, Children, and Investments: Top 5 Stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to shrewd takes on the stock market, you're unlikely to find too many that lag behind Leon Cooperman's analysis of the stock market and the broader financial environment in the United States. Over the course of his career, the billionaire has seen it all. An octogenarian, Cooperman started his career in 1967 - an era on Wall Street that was yet to be dominated by mega cap technology stocks. Back then, Wall Street investors were facing their own historic environment. While right now folks in the hedge fund and the broader finance industry are adjusting to an era of high interest rates and the 'end of free money' as Mr. Cooperman would put it, in the late 1960s, they were rejoicing on the Federal Reserve's decision to allow a portion of stock purchases to be funded by taking out loans.\n\nNaturally, this meant that more stocks changed hands and the euphoria would continue for the next couple of years until rising costs and dwindling interest led to the government stepping in and helping brokers manage the market. In this turmoil, Cooperman was working for the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) and he would continue to work for the bank until 1991, a period that would see him live through one of the most well known and devastating stock market crashes called Black Monday. A couple of years after Black Monday, Cooperman would leverage the skills he learned while managing stocks for one of the biggest investment banks in the world to try his own hand at wealth and fame by setting up a private investment partnership.\n\nWhile working at Goldman saw the famed investor make his mark on Wall Street by winning laurels, on the personal side, he had already achieved milestones. Characteristic of folks from his generation, even before Cooperman started working for Goldman to set him on a path to becoming one of the richest people in the world, he had already married his wife Toby Cooperman in 1964. Like Cooperman, Mrs. Cooperman also attended New York's Hunter College and graduated in the year of their marriage. During their time in college, the pair were quite close and would take up class positions such as president and vice president.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe start of Cooperman senior's journey at Goldman Sachs was accompanied by his six month old toddler, and today, he has two sons, Wayne Cooperman and Michael Cooperman. Both of these have followed their father into the finance industry, and Wayne Cooperman even has his own hedge fund called Cobalt Capital Management. Michael Cooperman, on the other hand, is more involved in his family's charitable endeavors and has been known to work at the Leon & Toby Cooperman Foundation. Cooperman Sr. is quite charitable too, and like several other well known hedge fund and investment professionals such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Mario Gabelli of GAMCO, he has also signed the giving pledge.\n\nWayne's trysts in the finance industry have also generated their fair share of controversy. One infamous period in Cooperman Sr.'s long and illustrious career on Wall Street was in 2010 when he had yet to shut down his investment firm. Back then, the billionaire's investment firm had held a stake in the oil and gas midstream company Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. Atlas announced a $682 million sale of an asset to the Canadian firm Enbridge, and Cooperman Sr. was accused of improperly profiting from the deal by buying more Atlas Pipeline shares with the inside knowledge that the deal would be announced soon. To make things interesting, the accusations tipped off the SEC to investigate Cooperman, who started to look into the matter purportedly after Wayne Cooperman noticed unusual derivative activity for Atlas shares right when the deal was to be announced.\n\nIn a rather interesting set of events, it appeared as if Cooperman Sr. had raised his son to detest insider trading while all the while trading stocks with inside knowledge himself! The saga lasted for six years, and despite the SEC offering him to settle in return for a five year ban, the investor stood his ground and settled for a fine without admitting to any wrongdoing.\n\nSince then, Cooperman shut down his firm in 2018 after he grew tired of the fast paced and stressful nature of professionally investing in stocks.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Goldman Sachs Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Report",
        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Goldman Sachs Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Report\n\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) is set to release earnings results for its first quarter before the opening bell on April 15, 2024.\n\nAnalysts expect the New York-based investment bank to report quarterly earnings at $8.56 per share, down from $8.79 per share in the year-ago period. Goldman Sachs is projected to report quarterly revenue of $12.92 billion, compared to $12.22 billion in the year-earlier quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nOn April 9, JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan maintained Goldman Sachs Group with a Market Outperform and raised the price target from $440 to $460.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Goldman Sachs, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company\u2019s dividends, too. As of now, Goldman Sachs offers an annual dividend yield of 2.77%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $2.75 per share ($11.00 a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $216,627 or around 545 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $43,325 or around 109 shares.\n\nRead This: Citizens And 2 Other Stocks Under $3 Insiders Are Buying\n\nView more earnings on GS\n\nTo calculate:  Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($11.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $11.00 = 545 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $11.00 = 109 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works:  The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nGS Price Action: Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 0.8% to close at $397.48 on Thursday.\n\nRead More:  Top 3 Health Care Stocks Which Could Rescue Your Portfolio This Quarter\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Goldman Sachs Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "High interest rates are getting more challenging for even the biggest banks",
        "content": "A key revenue source for three giant banks fell during the first three months of the year, showing that even the biggest financial institutions are struggling with the same challenges facing the rest of the industry as interest rates remain elevated.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) all said Friday that their net interest income dropped from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. It was down 4% at JPMorgan, 4% at Wells Fargo, and 2% at Citigroup.\n\nNet interest income is a critical measure for many banks, since it measures the difference between what banks earn on their assets and pay out on their deposits.\n\nSmaller banks have struggled to boost this measure over the last year as interest rates and deposit costs soared. Now there are some signs in the first quarter that high rates are starting to weigh on growth even at the nation\u2019s largest lenders. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJPMorgan said in a press release that its net interest income dropped due to \"deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances.\"\n\nDepositors are seeking out higher yields, as they have at smaller banks, and moving their money into products such as certificates of deposits where JPMorgan has to pay a higher rate.\n\n\"As customers move out of checking and savings, they may choose to go into CDs,\u201d CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters Friday in response to a question from Yahoo Finance. \u201cThat means that the bank is paying more for the internal migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the sort of deposits migration that we\u2019re expecting\u201d for the rest of 2024, he added.\n\nIt is certainly still true that the big banks are better positioned than their rivals to withstand a period of elevated interest rates and that they will still be able to earn plenty of money from lending.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s net interest income in the first quarter, for example, was $1 billion higher than expected, and JPMorgan did boost an estimate of net interest income for all of 2024 to $89 billion, excluding trading, up from a previous estimate of $88 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that was flat when compared to 2023. JPMorgan\u2019s stock dropped by more than 5% Friday as investors absorbed the news.\n\nOverall profits for JPMorgan were still up by 6% from a year ago, to $13.4 billion, beating Wall Street expectations.\n\n'We are a little bit cautious'\n\nBoth Wells Fargo and Citigroup disclosed they are also paying more for their deposits.\n\nWells Fargo's average deposit cost was 1.74%, which was higher than 1.58% in the fourth quarter and 0.83% in the year-ago period. Its overall profits dropped 7% from a year earlier.\n\nAt Citigroup, its average rate paid on deposits rose to 3.70%, up from 3.61% from the previous quarter and 2.72% from the year-ago period. Its overall profits dropped 27% from a year earlier.\n\nCitigroup also provided some updates about an ambitious restructuring of the bank that is resulting in thousands of job losses. It said it eliminated 7,000 positions as part of a target of reducing headcount by 20,000 by 2026.\n\nThe stocks of Wells Fargo and Citigroup were both flat Friday.\n\nThere were also a number of positives in the banks' results Friday. JPMorgan set aside less money for future loan losses and investment banking fees jumped 21% to $2 billion, a sign that a Wall Street revival may be underway.\n\nBut most of that came from debt underwriting, as opposed to advisory work.\n\n\"We are a little bit cautious,\" Barnum said about any pickup in M&A activity.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s boss, Jamie Dimon, also offered more warnings about the road ahead for the US economy, repeating a theme he hammered home in his annual shareholder letter released earlier in the week.\n\n\"Many economic indicators continue to be favorable,\" Dimon said. \"However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces.\"\n\nHe cited wars and geopolitical tensions, \"persistent inflationary pressures\" that \"may likely continue,\" and a campaign of quantitative tightening from the Federal Reserve.\n\nDimon has said he is prepared for rates to go as high as 8%. When asked by Yahoo Finance on Friday about the prospect of rates remaining higher for longer, he said \"rates being higher on their own isn't that important, what is important is why.\"\n\n\"If it is because of stagflation that's obviously negative. If it\u2019s because of, you know, healthy growth, that's actually pretty good.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit\u00a0Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.\n\nThe global bond market experienced continued selling pressure in Asia following the release of higher-than-anticipated US inflation data, reinforcing the perception that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rate stance. Across the region, bond prices declined sharply, leading to significant increases in benchmark 10-year yields in Australia and New Zealand, each rising by over 10 basis points. Similarly, Japanese yields surged to levels not seen since November, reflecting the broader trend of rising yields in response to inflationary concerns. While US Treasuries saw a modest rebound following a selloff on Wednesday, which propelled the 10-year yield above 4.5% for the first time in five months, the overall sentiment remained cautious amid lingering uncertainties surrounding inflation and monetary policy. The escalation in bond yields reflects investors' apprehensions regarding the potential impact of sustained inflation on central bank policies and future interest rate decisions. As market participants continue to monitor inflationary pressures and economic data releases, volatility in bond markets is expected to persist, with implications for broader financial markets.\n\nGoldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) is shifting its investment strategy, opting to cash in on the soaring gains of technology stocks and reallocating funds to more attractively valued sectors, reported Bloomberg. According to Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at GSAM, the firm anticipates mounting pressure on technology shares and favors sectors such as energy and Japanese equities. In Wilson-Elizondo's assessment, while the US economy appears to be headed for a soft landing, there are considerable risks that could alter its course. This shift in investment approach reflects GSAM's proactive stance in navigating potential market headwinds and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. The move underscores a broader trend in the investment landscape, where investors are reassessing their allocations amidst evolving market dynamics. As the technology sector matures, GSAM anticipates a divergence in stock returns within the industry, prompting a strategic reallocation of resources to capitalize on emerging trends and sectors poised for growth. By rebalancing its portfolio and diversifying across sectors, GSAM aims to mitigate risks and enhance potential returns for its clients. This proactive approach highlights GSAM's commitment to optimizing investment outcomes in an ever-changing market environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's consumer prices stagnated, barely registering an increase compared to the previous year, while industrial prices continued their downward trajectory, signaling persistent deflationary pressures that pose challenges to the economy's recovery. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the consumer price index (CPI) in March rose by a mere 0.1% from the same period a year earlier. This figure fell short of economists' expectations, who had anticipated a 0.4% gain. The March inflation rate marked a decline from February's 0.7%, when prices had risen above zero for the first time in six months, primarily driven by spending during the Lunar New Year holiday period. In parallel, producer prices extended their decline for the 18th consecutive month, reflecting ongoing weakness in industrial demand and pricing dynamics. The subdued inflationary environment underscores the challenges facing China's economy, particularly amidst weak domestic demand and external headwinds. The lackluster inflation data may intensify calls for further stimulus measures to bolster economic activity and support growth momentum. As policymakers navigate the delicate balance between stimulating growth and managing inflationary pressures, the latest inflation figures highlight the need for targeted policy interventions to sustain economic recovery and mitigate deflationary risks.\n\nIn financial markets, notable equities such as monday.com Ltd.

Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks\n\n10. Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.51\u00a0(+1.15%)\n\nOn April 8, Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) experienced a noteworthy shift in sentiment as Seaport Global Securities revised its stance on the stock from a Buy to a Neutral rating. Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) shares has surged by 43% year-to-date, comfortably surpassing the previously established price target of $45. The catalyst behind this reevaluation stems partly from recent market activity, notably significant purchases by Chairman and CEO Jim Dolan, which have bolstered the stock's performance. The analyst accompanying the downgrade highlighted the necessity for Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) shares to consolidate after their substantial appreciation. Anticipating a more subdued trajectory in the upcoming quarters compared to the robust gains of the recent past, the analysis underscores the need for a stabilization phase. While acknowledging the potential for long-term growth through initiatives such as international franchise expansion and the development of the Las Vegas Sphere, the analyst cautioned that these endeavors might take time to translate into tangible earnings. Despite the downgrade, Seaport Global Securities remains optimistic about Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) future prospects, particularly regarding the potential of its franchise model, revenue-sharing agreements, and licensing strategies. However, these avenues are perceived as longer-term opportunities that may not yield immediate results. The analyst stressed the importance of gaining clarity on the company's ability to effectively utilize its entertainment venues before reinstating a more positive outlook. Looking ahead, Seaport Global Securities has indicated its intent to continually reassess its position on Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) as new information emerges, particularly regarding the sustainable utilization of the company's assets. Monitoring Sphere Entertainment's stock for indications of enduring growth and capacity optimization will be crucial in informing future ratings adjustments.\n\n09. Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.13\u00a0(+0.95%)\n\nOn April 9, Lake Street Capital Markets shift its stance on Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI) from Buy to Hold, coupled with a newly established price target of $16.00. This recalibration comes in response to the company's disappointing performance in the first quarter, prompting a downward revision of its full-year revenue and AEBITDA forecasts. The downgrade can be attributed to Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI) weaker-than-expected results in search advertising, which have been adversely affected by recent modifications made by Microsoft's Bing (NASDAQ:MSFT). Consequently, Lake Street Capital Markets has adjusted its projections to align with the company's updated guidance. The financial underperformance in the first quarter has prompted a more cautious outlook on the stock, reflected in the shift to a Hold rating. Investors are now eagerly anticipating the company's upcoming earnings per share call scheduled for May 8th before the market opens, seeking clarity on Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI) strategy and expectations for recovery. The revision in both the company's financial outlook and the stock's rating underscores the challenges prevailing in the search advertising sector. The forthcoming EPS call in May is poised to provide additional insights into Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI) path forward. With Lake Street Capital Markets setting a new price target of $16.00, shareholders and potential investors are advised to closely monitor developments, especially in anticipation of the upcoming earnings call, which may offer valuable insights into the company's trajectory.\n\nRichie Capital Group made the following comment about Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPerion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI) (PERI up +56.4%) \u2013 Our investment in the Israeli based ad-tech company has now been a top performer for two quarters in a row. In February, Perion announced full year 2022 earnings which included guidance for 14% revenue and EBITDA growth in 2023. This implies meaningful growth in a challenging environment where their peers continue to struggle. Despite the stock\u2019s strong performance, Perion is still trading at a modest 19x earnings.\n\nIn addition to the optimistic growth outlook, Perion seems to be benefiting from anticipation of Bing\u2019s new ChatGPT driven search engine. Bing is Perion\u2019s largest customer. We, along with Perion\u2019s management, believe that the \u201cnew Bing\u201d offers a meaningful growth opportunity. The more users convert to Bing, the more publishers will advertise on the platform and drive Perion revenue. On Microsoft\u2019s Q4 earnings call, CFO Amy Hood discussed the impact of growing Bing market share: \u201cevery percentage point of share it gains in search equals roughly $2 billion in additional advertising revenue.\u201d It is difficult to envision a scenario where Perion is not a direct beneficiary of Bing\u2019s success\u2026\u201d (Click here to view the full text)\n\n08. Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Downgrade: -5.71\u00a0(-1.25%)\n\nOn April 9, Citi made significant adjustments to its evaluation of Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN), an industrial gas giant, transitioning its rating from \"Buy\" to \"Neutral,\" while concurrently raising the price target to $500 from $475. This decision comes amidst Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) notable stock growth, boasting an approximate 11% increase year-to-date and a staggering 28% surge over the past 12 months. Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\u00a0has garnered recognition for its adeptness in pricing strategies, productivity enhancements, and the promising trajectory of its long-term earnings. However, Citi suggests that the current valuation of Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) shares may have already factored in potential positive financial outcomes for 2024. This anticipation of sustained robust performance poses a risk of the stock underperforming in the forthcoming quarters. With the revised price target now standing at $500, Citi's adjustment signals a cautious optimism. It indicates recognition of the potential for Linde's share value to continue rising, but also advises vigilance, as the current market price may have already incorporated anticipated future gains. This shift by Citi reflects a more conservative near-term outlook for Linde. Despite acknowledging Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) operational prowess, Citi's analysis suggests that the market's current expectations could lead to less favorable results for investors if the company fails to consistently surpass financial projections in the short term. Monitoring Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) performance against these expectations will be crucial for investors navigating the evolving landscape of the industrial gas sector.\n\n07. Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.89\u00a0(-4.90%)\n\nOn April 10, UBS Group issued a research note downgrading Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) from a \"buy\" rating to a \"neutral\" rating, leading to a notable price reaction with shares declining by 4.90% as of midday. Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) operates as a prominent gold producer, boasting reserves and resources across various regions including Chile, South Africa, Ghana, West Africa, Australia, and Peru. Additionally, the company engages in exploration activities for copper deposits, further diversifying its portfolio. Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) holds interests in nine operational mines, along with substantial gold mineral reserves and mineral resources, underpinning its position in the industry. Notably, the company recently announced a semi-annual dividend, which was disbursed on Thursday, March 28. Shareholders of record on Friday, March 15 received a dividend of $0.1717 per share, marking an increase from Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) previous semi-annual dividend of $0.17. This adjustment translates to a yield of 2.5%. The ex-dividend date for this dividend was Thursday, March 14. The downgrade by UBS Group reflects a shift in sentiment regarding Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI), from a more bullish stance to a more neutral one. While the company maintains its status as a key player in the gold production sector, the revised rating suggests a tempered expectation for future performance. Investors may now scrutinize Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) operational strategies and financial outlook more closely in light of this revised assessment.\n\n06. BBB Foods Inc. (NYSE:TBBB)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.08\u00a0(-5.00%)\n\nOn April 10, UBS downgraded the BBB Foods Inc. (NYSE:TBBB) stock from Buy to Neutral while simultaneously raising the price target to $27.00 from the previous $26.00. This decision comes amidst a notable price reaction, with BBB Foods Inc. (NYSE:TBBB) shares declining by 5.00% as of midday, following the announcement. The rationale behind the revision stems from BBB Foods Inc. (NYSE:TBBB) remarkable share price surge of over 30% since its initial public offering (IPO) on February 9. Despite this impressive performance, UBS believes that the stock's current valuation is reasonable considering the company's growth potential. Currently, BBB Foods Inc. (NYSE:TBBB) stock is trading at a multiple that UBS deems fair, standing at 12 times the estimated EV/EBITDA for 2025, adjusted for IFRS16 accounting standards. However, this multiple could potentially increase to 15.8 times when factoring in a projected 49% dilution from BBB Foods' Equity Incentive Plan. The market's current price of $23 per share reflects expectations for an EBITDA compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2025 of 41.3%, slightly below UBS's estimate of 49.2%. With these projections and considering the stock's recent performance, UBS believes that the risks and rewards associated with investing in BBB Foods are now more evenly balanced. UBS's revised rating suggests that while the firm acknowledges BBB Foods Inc. (NYSE:TBBB) strong growth prospects, it perceives limited potential for further stock appreciation at the current levels. The modest increase in the price target reflects UBS's confidence in the company's fundamental value, albeit with a more cautious outlook on the stock's short-term upside potential.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks 11 Best Italian Stocks To Invest In 2024 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:GS) institutional investors lost 3.2% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Goldman Sachs Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 43% of the company Insiders have been selling lately\n\nIf you want to know who really controls The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 69% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nNo shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.2% in value last week. However, the 25% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Goldman Sachs Group, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Goldman Sachs Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Goldman Sachs Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs Group\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$717m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 31% stake in Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Launched on 03/15/2022, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF (GLOV) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the market.\n\nWhat Are Smart Beta ETFs?\n\nFor a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.\n\nMarket cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.\n\nHowever, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.\n\nThis kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.\n\nWhile this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.\n\nFund Sponsor & Index\n\nThe fund is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds. GLOV has been able to amass assets over $865.62 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the GOLDMAN SACHS ACTBT WORLD LW VL PL EQ ID before fees and expenses.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity Index delivers exposure to large and mid-capitalization equity securities of developed market issuers, including the United States.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.91%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 3.31% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 13.96% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nThe ETF has gained about 6.39% so far this year and was up about 17.76% in the last one year (as of 04/10/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $38.70 and $47.02.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.75 and standard deviation of 13.84% for the trailing three-year period. With about 391 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\n\nIShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $19.49 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $35.79 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Bad debt write offs are expected to surge by 76% and new provisions set aside to cover future loan losses are expected to jump 31%.\n\nMuch of the increase in write-offs will likely come from souring credit card loans, according to David Fanger, a senior vice president with Moody's Investor Service.\n\nBut investors may be more interested in the rest of 2024 than the first quarter. So far this year they have been rewarding the biggest banks at the expense of smaller rivals.\n\nThe stocks of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Bank of America have climbed 20%, 17%, 16% and 112% so far this year \u2014 outperforming major indexes.\n\nWhat could help drive those stocks higher is if the banks predict more profits for the rest of the year due to changing expectations of how many rate cuts are expected this year from the Fed.\n\nTraders now expect one or two cuts, instead of the six they predicted at the beginning of the year, due to hot economic data and signs of persistent inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nFewer cuts actually benefit the giant banks because it allows them to charge more for their loans while keeping funding costs relatively low, boosting a key measure of profits known as net interest income. That dynamic helped them churn out profits for much of 2023.\n\n\u201cEvery time the number of rate cuts and timing is pushed out, the street is updating their expectations of what net interest income could look like this year,\" Ebrahim Poonawala, a large bank analyst for BofA Securities, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGerard Cassidy, a large bank analyst for RBC said in a research note Monday that as 2024 progresses \u201cwe could see upward revisions to EPS estimates driven by better-than-expected net interest income growth and outperformance on credit quality.\u201d\n\nWhat could also help the stocks of big banks is more optimism about dealmaking and trading for the rest of 2024. That issue will be of particular interest to stockholders of Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), two Wall Street-reliant institutions that report Monday and Tuesday.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nThe big banks are expected to report that first-quarter revenues from underwriting bonds and IPOs rose while advising on mergers and acquisitions still lags \u2014 extending a problem that challenged banks for much for 2023 and 2022.\n\n\"What you\u2019ve seen is the debt underwriting business picking up significantly,\" said BofA's Poonawala, who also pointed out that regulatory scrutiny hasn't been conducive to big deals.\n\nM&A recovery also just takes longer, according to Moody's Fanger.\n\n\"What's being completed in this quarter were deals that were agreed to in Q2 or Q3 of last year,\" he said.\n\nTrading revenues are expected to be down across the board from last year, although Bank of America could buck the trend, according to analyst estimates.\n\nInvestors may not be as kind to regional banks as they begin reporting results in the coming weeks. Mid-sized lenders are expected to struggle more if the Fed does in fact keep rates higher for longer, since they have been paying much more than giant lenders to keep their deposits intact.\n\nRegional banks also face more exposure to some commercial real estate loans that have lost value and need to be refinanced, an emerging source of problems for some institutions such as New York Community Bancorp (NYCB).\n\n\"Bigger banks\u2019 revenues are more diversified and they don't have as much commercial real estate exposure,\" Chris McGratty, a regional bank analyst and head of US bank research for KBW, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor all of 2024, KBW expects big bank profits to rise 4%. Regional and smaller lenders will see a 9-10% drop in their net income for the same period.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "3 High-Growth Biotech Stocks Investors Shouldn\u2019t Sleep On in April",
        "content": "It\u2019s been a volatile start to the second quarter for many sectors. However, investors continue to seek out undervalued biotech stocks for robust returns over the long term. Plenty of options exist in various niches within the biotech sector. That said, investor focus remains on key sectors, including weight-loss drugs, Parkinson\u2019s treatments and drugs aimed at Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that biotech stocks are among some of the higher-risk options in the market. These companies\u2019 massive capital spending budgets with uncertain future revenue streams make most stocks very speculative bets by their inherent nature.\n\nBut some stalwarts in key spaces are worth considering for the long haul. Aging demographics and other tailwinds in key areas make these three stocks worth buying.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) continues to capitalize on the booming weight loss drug market with Zepbound, targeting the obesity epidemic. Zepbound\u2019s injectable solution is proven to yield significant weight loss for patients, with analysts projecting potential annual revenue of more than $25 billion.\n\nEli Lilly has also partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pharmacy to distribute medications, including Zepbound. LillyDirect offers telehealth consultations for prescriptions and home delivery. The move targets weight-loss drug demand, competing with traditional pharmacies. LillyDirect currently offers 14 medications, with growth plans to expand this assortment.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s demand for its drug has led to significant Zepbound shortages, which are expected to be seen through the end of this month. This could lead to underwhelming results, given where expectations are for the company\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nThat said, I think the company\u2019s strong demand for its core weight-loss drug offerings is a sign of immense value creation over the long-term. Those seeking a true winner in the biotech space should consider this stock on any significant dips.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter receiving their approval for their gene therapy project, pharmaceutical giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is raising capital to start production. The company\u2019s pipeline includes a revolutionary cystic fibrosis treatment with a combination of its drugs, Kalydeco and Trikafta. The company anticipates FDA approval for VX-548, expanding the indications beyond cystic fibrosis to other ailments.\n\nVertex has surged over the past year, with a 41% move higher in 2023 alone. Many analysts expect this trend to continue, with the stock\u2019s rise tied to Vertex\u2019s solid financials and a robust drug pipeline. Since its IPO, VRTX stock has outperformed the S&P 500, offering rewarding upside to investors who bought into the company\u2019s innovative drugs and strategic partnerships in its key business segments.\n\nStory continues\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals launched the late-stage phase II/III AMPLITUDE study on inaxaplin for APOL1-mediated kidney disease. The study now includes adolescents. It aims to assess kidney function improvement compared to placebo. An interim analysis at week 48 may prompt FDA accelerated approval.\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPioneering some of the most innovative therapies with the help of advanced genetics, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is undoubtedly a biotech stock worth paying attention to. The company has grown drastically since 1980, providing relatively steady growth in this sector. This has allowed Amgen to be among the few biotech stocks to pay dividends, with a 3.3% yield at the time of writing. So, this stock is more than just a growth story \u2013 there\u2019s also an income component to consider.\n\nWith a valuation of roughly $145 billion at the time of writing, investors in Amgen benefit from the company\u2019s size and scale. Amgen is another player exploring obesity drugs, with its MariTide offering similar to those provided by its peers (monthly injections). Should Amgen generate significant traction in this market, it could be an under-appreciated stock. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) seems to think so, rendering a conviction buy rating on AMGN stock.\n\nAlthough Amgen faces growth challenges similar to other large-cap pharma names, the company has weathered the storm relatively well. The stock has traded roughly flat over the past year, providing an intriguing entry point for long-term growth and dividend investors to get in right now. The company also fortifies its portfolio against biosimilars with a robust pipeline and international presence. So, for those seeking long-term upside in this sector, this is a company to put on your watch list now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Crypto Trader\u2019s Criminal Trial Tests \u2018Code Is Law\u2019 Claim",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A jailed trader accused of stealing $110 million on the Mango Markets exchange faces a criminal trial this week that will test the reach of a US crackdown on cryptocurrencies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrumpism Is Emptying Churches Why India\u2019s South Rejects Modi \u2014 And Why It Matters RBC Fires CFO Ahn After Probe Into Personal Relationship Yellen Implores China to Rethink Economic Growth Strategy The Odds of $100 Oil Are Rising as Supply Shocks Convulse the Market\n\nProsecutors charged Avraham Eisenberg with manipulating Mango Markets futures contracts on Oct. 11, 2022, to boost the price of swaps by 1,300% in 20 minutes. He then \u201cborrowed\u201d from the exchange against the inflated value of those contracts, a move the government claims was a theft.\n\nJury selection began Monday in New York federal court, where groundbreaking crypto cases have played out. FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced there last month to 25 years in prison for orchestrating a multibillion-dollar scheme, while Terraform Labs Pte. and co-founder Do Kwon were found liable Friday for fraud in civil trial over the firm\u2019s 2022 collapse, which wiped out $40 billion in investor assets.\n\nEisenberg, a self-described \u201capplied game theorist,\u201d claims his actions weren\u2019t theft at all. Rather, he says, he legally exploited a weakness in the decentralized finance application. The trial will apparently be the first time a US criminal jury will weigh what type of \u201cDeFi\u201d transactions are legal.\n\nIn the crypto world, where digital blockchains govern who owns what, the virtual ecosystem is built around the notion that \u201ccode is law.\u201d It means that if something isn\u2019t explicitly forbidden by terms of a crypto platform, then government can\u2019t intercede. But prosecutors say those rules can\u2019t protect traders against possible criminal charges for market manipulation or fraud.\n\n\u201cIt touches on the big argument within crypto \u2014 is code law?\u201d said Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at TRM Labs. \u201cIf the code allows somebody to do that, does the actual law? Obviously, the government took a different approach that code is not law. Just because there is an opportunity to exploit it does not mean that it\u2019s legal.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEisenberg targeted Mango Markets, a decentralized autonomous organization that lets people borrow, lend and trade cryptocurrencies and sets its own rules for participants. The theft alleged by prosecutors in this week\u2019s trial is one of the largest in criminal cases involving a DAO.\n\nFour days after his transactions on the exchange, Eisenberg posted on Twitter: \u201cI was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week.\u201d He also said he believed \u201call of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed.\u201d\n\nIn a deal with the Mango DAO, Eisenberg agreed to return $67 million of what he\u2019d gotten from depositors in exchange for them agreeing to release him from legal claims and not pursuing his prosecution.\n\nEisenberg left Puerto Rico, where he was living, the day after his Mango trades and flew to Israel. When he returned to Puerto Rico on Dec. 26, 2022, US agents arrested him. He\u2019s been in jail ever since, as a judge ruled he poses a risk of fleeing before trial. He was indicted on charges of commodities fraud, commodities manipulation and wire fraud. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also sued Eisenberg, as did Mango Labs LLC, which claimed his deal with depositors was unenforceable and made under duress. All of those civil lawsuits are on hold pending the criminal trial before US District Judge Arun Subramanian.\n\nIn screening potential jurors, Subramanian dismissed one woman who said she had \u201cvery negative views of crypto.\u201d The judge has scheduled opening statements for Tuesday.\n\nJurors will have to digest a complex set of facts about crypto trading, market manipulation and decentralized finance protocol.\n\nAnonymous Accounts\n\nProsecutors allege Eisenberg deceptively used two anonymous accounts at Mango markets to buy and sell himself futures contracts. Those contracts were based on the relative value of Mango\u2019s token, known as MNGO, and a stablecoin called USDC. The price of the futures sales was set by computer programs, known as oracles, that looked at exchange rates on various crypto platforms.\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 11, 2022, Eisenberg funded each of his anonymous accounts with $5 million in USDC, prosecutors allege. He used one account to sell MNGO futures contracts, and another to buy them. He then bought a large number of MNGO tokens, which boosted their value relative to USDC, sending the futures contracts up by 1,300%.\n\nEisenberg then exploited a feature of the exchange that allowed participants to \u201cborrow\u201d against their holdings, withdrawing $110 million in cryptocurrencies from Mango Markets, but he had \u201cno intention of repaying them,\u201d the US charges. The price of MNGO futures contracts immediately collapsed.\n\nAn attorney for Eisenberg and a spokesman for federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nEisenberg, who grew up in Suffern, New York, had a bail hearing in Puerto Rico in December 2022. The lawyer said Eisenberg was a \u201cvery bright\u201d crypto trader who was a math major at Yeshiva University.\n\n\u201cHe specializes in game theory and these cryptocurrency markets are a lot about that,\u201d said his attorney at the time, Manuel San Juan Demartino. Eisenberg, who lived in Puerto Rico, flew to Israel the day after the alleged theft, a prosecutor said. Eisenberg, a US citizen, also got Israeli citizenship before returning to Puerto Rico, the prosecutor said.\n\nThe criminal case is US v. Eisenberg, 23-cr-00010, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\n\n--With assistance from Olga Kharif.\n\n(Updates with jury selection beginning, opening statements set for Tuesday.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs (GS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Goldman Sachs (GS) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 15, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $12.94 billion, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.84% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goldman?\n\nFor Goldman, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.24%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Goldman will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goldman would post earnings of $3.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.48, delivering a surprise of +57.93%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nGoldman appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The whole tech rebound, following a significant downturn the year before, was enough to question the validity of value equities, which historically have shown better performances over the long term, according to analysts. Value stocks are mainly well-established companies that despite having stable business models and sustainable dividends, typically trade at lower prices compared to their intrinsic value, presenting an opportunity for investors to purchase them at a discount. Professor-turned-money manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing expert David Dreman truly believed the \u2018tortoise beats the hare\u2019 approach in investing. Their research suggested that value investing tends to outperform growth about 70% of the time, irrespective of company size. Through meticulous studies covering companies of varying sizes, they found that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year compared to growth stocks over extended time frames.\n\nWhile value stocks may not have performed as well as growth stocks last year, analysts are highlighting the potential buying opportunities within this space. Morningstar chief US marketing strategist Dave Sekera has given a positive stance on value investing in 2024. Here are some comments from the analysts:\n\n\u201cWe see much better long-term investment opportunities within the value category and think investors should consider paring those growth stocks that have become overvalued and overextended. Now may be a good time to begin allocating to those contrarian plays that have underperformed, are unloved, and, most importantly, are undervalued.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Franklin Templeton have also expressed optimism regarding the performance of value stocks this year. Despite a period where value lagged behind growth on a global scale, the firm predicts a promising outlook ahead due to favorable global stock valuations, indicating potential for positive long-term returns. Moreover, the firm anticipates increased investment in value-oriented sectors and segments of the market, driven by ongoing consumer spending and recent government initiatives. The normalization of monetary policy is also expected to enhance the appeal of interest rate-sensitive and dividend-paying sectors to investors.\n\nAs we mentioned above, value stocks are often recognized for their dividends. Moreover, these equities offer higher dividend yields and have strong fundamental ratios when compared with growth stocks. Dividend growth is one of the most important factors when it comes to dividend investing. In this regard, The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index is used as a benchmark for dividend-focused strategies. The index seeks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. In 30 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts, we referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices which revealed that investment strategies aimed at generating income often show value characteristics. Stocks that offer high dividend yields and trade at lower prices often grab investors\u2019 attention. We also revealed that the dividend aristocrat index possesses a combination a combination of both growth and value attributes, rather than exhibiting a strong preference for one style over the other. A detailed analysis of the index from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown, indicating an average exposure of 59.04% to value stocks and 40.94% to growth stocks during this time period.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "content": "David Solomon endured his most challenging year as CEO in 2023, and the pressure on the Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO is not letting up in 2024.\n\nTwo prominent proxy advisory firms are advising stockholders to cast votes this month that would limit the power of Solomon, with results due to be tallied at the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 24.\n\nThe proposal that garnered a stamp of approval from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Company would split the CEO and chairman roles, both currently occupied by Solomon. A similar proposal last year did not pass, winning only 16% of votes. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. Photo: REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Reuters / Reuters)\n\n\"Shareholders would benefit from more independent oversight,\" ISS wrote in a report, citing \"missteps and steep losses\u201d associated with a push into consumer banking that \"seem to have trickled into further human capital issues.\"\n\nGlass, Lewis is separately suggesting that stockholders also vote against Goldman\u2019s executive pay plan due to a \"significant disconnect between pay and performance.\" ISS provided \"cautionary support\" for the executive pay plan.\n\nSolomon\u2019s 2023 compensation rose 24% \u2014 to $31 million \u2014 despite a profit decline of the same amount.\n\nNot only is that up from the $25 million he was awarded in 2022, it is more than his rivals Brian Moynihan, Charles Scharf and Jane Fraser made at Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C).\n\nOnly JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and outgoing Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman were awarded more for their 2023 performance.\n\nOther top executives at Goldman, including chief operating officer John Waldron, also saw their pay rise. Waldron\u2019s cash bonus went up 30% to $11.26 million.\n\nRecommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis carry a lot of weight with some stockholders, although many of the largest investors in American companies have their own teams that evaluate such proposals.\n\nGoldman's largest stockholders are Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK) and State Street (STT).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe compensation increase for Solomon was a sign that board support for Solomon had perhaps solidified after he spent much of 2023 attempting a tricky retrenchment from consumer lending while focusing the firm on its core strengths of trading, asset management, and investment banking.\n\nIts full-year net income of $8.52 billion was the worst mark for Goldman since 2019, Solomon's first full year in charge, as dealmaking also slowed across Wall Street. The firm did, however, post a sizable gain in the fourth quarter as equities trading and wealth management rose.\n\nA lot is in flux at Goldman as key executives depart, raising new questions about the race to eventually succeed Solomon.\n\nOne surprise exit in 2024 is Jim Esposito, who had been co-head of Goldman\u2019s global banking and markets division and is leaving after nearly three decades. Esposito had been viewed on Wall Street as among the possible successors to Solomon.\n\nAnother recent departure in March was Stephanie Cohen, global head of its platform solutions division.\n\nEven the board of Goldman is changing. This year ex-Goldman CFO David Viniar was appointed as the board\u2019s lead director to replace Adebayo Ogunlesi, who announced he would step down after selling his infrastructure investment company to BlackRock.\n\nSolomon has one more chance before the company\u2019s annual meeting to show investors he is turning things around. Goldman will report its first-quarter earnings on April 15.\n\nYear to date, the stock is by roughly 5%. Since Solomon was named CEO in October 2018, its stock has risen 83%.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court said former ViacomCBS investors may sue Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks that underwrote two stock offerings for the media company, upholding a ruling that banks fear could upend capital markets.\n\nThursday's decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan came one week after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Goldman and Morgan Stanley by investors in ViacomCBS and other stocks once held by Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management.\n\nInvestors said the banks hid their role as counterparties in total return swaps for Archegos, and dumped their shares to avoid losses in March 2021 as Archegos, with about $20 billion of ViacomCBS exposure, missed margin calls and swiftly imploded.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoldman and Morgan Stanley, which were two of Archegos' prime brokers, said banks already followed a slew of procedures to avert conflicts of interest, protect client confidences and prevent insider trading.\n\nThey said the \"sweeping expansion\" of disclosures ordered by a trial judge last year would \"pull the rug out\" from under countless banks, including by requiring them to predict how their stock holdings would affect markets.\n\nBut the five-judge appeals court said ViacomCBS' banks had a duty to disclose transactions that \"affect\" the stock price, and that saying in offering documents they \"may\" conduct such transactions could be misleading if they were already planned.\n\nThe court also said the banks wouldn't have to reveal confidential information about clients, and could have simply disclosed their intent to sell ViacomCBS shares without mentioning Archegos.\n\nKannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who argued the appeal for Goldman and Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.\n\nThe lawsuit concerned offerings of ViacomCBS common and preferred stock in March 2021.\n\nInvestors were led by the Camelot Event Driven Fund and the Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday's decision largely upheld a February 2023 ruling by Justice Andrew Borrok of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.\n\nIn the federal ruling, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said investors in Archegos' stocks did not adequately allege that Goldman and Morgan Stanley conducted insider trading, or breached any fiduciary duty to the individual companies.\n\nHwang and former Archegos Chief Financial Officer Patrick Halligan face a scheduled May 8 criminal trial in Manhattan over their roles in Archegos' collapse.\n\nThe case is Camelot Event Driven Fund et al v Morgan Stanley & Co et al, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1st Department, No. 2023-00983.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs got a mixed report card in an annual look at how much it pays women in the U.K. The bank, which has a big international hub in London and runs a retail arm in the U.K., has experienced an exodus of senior women executives, many of whom have encountered challenges moving into the company's highest ranks and who have found better opportunities elsewhere. Goldman showed a 54% gap between what it pays men and women at its main U.K. unit in 2023, based on average hourly pay, and 28.5% by median pay. \"This gender pay gap report does not account for pay in similar role or tenure, but we know that we need to do more to increase representation of women at the senior-most levels of the firm,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\nContinue reading",

        "title": "XLE ETF: Energy Stocks are Heating Up Again",
        "content": "Don\u2019t look now, but the energy sector is heating up again, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE) is quietly up 16% year-to-date, pushing past a new 52-week high.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on XLE based on the momentum in the energy sector, its portfolio of highly-rated energy stocks, and the relatively cheap valuation of these holdings, even after accounting for this strong 2024 performance. I\u2019m also a fan of XLE because of its cost-effective expense ratio and its 3% dividend yield.\n\nFavorable Setup for Energy Prices?\n\nCrude oil prices are quietly up 18.6% year-to-date currently, buoying the energy stocks that extract, refine, and sell the commodity. And many analysts believe that oil prices could have more room to run. Russia is in the process of reducing production, which would reduce supply.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expect commodities, in general, including oil, to post strong gains over the course of 2024 based on lower interest rates, a recovery in manufacturing, and persistent geopolitical risks.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs analysts aren\u2019t alone, as Goldman\u2019s former head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, now with Carlyle Group, also believes this is a favorable setup for oil prices. Currie believes that oil prices could rise \u201cwell above\u201d the norm of $70-90 per barrel if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the months ahead.\n\nBeyond the machinations of the Fed, Currie points to additional factors like China moving to bolster manufacturing and Europe working to rebuild its energy reserves as further catalysts, telling Bloomberg TV, \u201cI want to be long oil and the rest of the commodity complex in this environment,\u201d and, \u201cThe upside here is significant.\u201d\n\nXLE\u2019s Strategy\n\nXLE invests in an index that, according to the fund, \u201cseeks to provide an effective representation of the energy sector\u201d of the S&P 500 (SPX). XLE aims to give investors \u201cprecise exposure to companies in the oil, gas and consumable fuel, energy equipment and services industries.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors can use XLE to \u201ctake strategic or tactical positions at a more targeted level than traditional style based investing.\u201d\n\nThe ETF launched all the way back in 1998 and is by far the largest and most popular energy-themed ETF in today\u2019s market, with $39.3 billion of assets under management (AUM),\u00a0making it nearly four times the size of its next-largest competitor, the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSEARCA:VDE) which has $8.7 billion in AUM.\n\nHighly-Rated Top Holdings\n\nXLE holds just 24 stocks. Its top 10 holdings make up 76.2% of the portfolio, and top holdings ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have large weightings of 22.8% and 16.5%, respectively, so it has to be said that this isn\u2019t a very diversified ETF. However, as a directional bet on U.S. energy stocks, it gets the job done and is a good representation of the sector.\n\nBelow is a look at XLE\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nFurthermore, while there isn\u2019t a lot of diversification, some of the stocks that XLE owns boast fantastic Smart Scores.\n\nThe Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nSix out of XLE\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. Chevron tops the list with a \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 rating, while ExxonMobil, Phillips66 (NYSE:PSX), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), and Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) all sport impressive Smart Scores of 9 out of 10.\n\nXLE itself boasts an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nWhile these holdings score highly based on the Smart Score system and have performed well in 2024, for the most part, their valuations are still undemanding. In fact, as of April 2, the fund\u2019s average price-to-earnings ratio is just 13.6x, representing a significant discount to the S&P 500, which currently has a much higher average price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6.\n\nXLE\u2019s top holding, ExxonMobil, trades at just 13x 2024 consensus earnings estimates, while the second-largest holding, Chevron, trades at a similarly modest 12.5x 2024 earnings estimates.\n\nWhile energy stocks have performed well so far this year, their valuations are still attractive, and there\u2019s little to suggest that they are tapped out from a valuation perspective.\n\nXLE\u2019s Attractive and Reliable Dividend\n\nEnergy stocks have long been known for their durable and above-average dividends, so it\u2019s no surprise that XLE is a dividend payer. The ETF currently yields 3%. Its yield has been higher in the past, but it has gone down as the ETF\u2019s price has gone up, which is a tradeoff most holders will be happy with. Plus, while the 3% yield may not be eye-popping, it\u2019s still more than double the yield of the S&P 500. Furthermore, XLE is as consistent as they come, paying dividends for 24 consecutive years.\n\nWhat Is XLE\u2019s Expense Ratio?\n\nWith an expense ratio of just 0.09%, XLE is super cheap. This 0.09% expense ratio means that if an investor allocates $10,000 into XLE, they will pay just $9 in fees over the course of the year.\n\nAssuming that XLE maintains this current expense ratio and returns 5% per year, this same investor would pay just $115 in fees over a 10-year time horizon, making XLE a very cost-effective ETF.\n\nIs XLE Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, XLE earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average XLE stock price target of $101.57 implies 6.2% upside potential.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nXLE is off to a nice start in 2024, and there\u2019s plenty to like about it, going forward. I\u2019m bullish on this popular energy ETF based on the potentially favorable climate for oil prices, XLE\u2019s highly-rated group of energy stocks with strong Smart Scores, the relatively inexpensive valuation of these holdings, and XLE\u2019s attractive 3% dividend yield. XLE\u2019s favorable expense ratio also makes it a great way to invest in the space.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "\u2018We\u2019re not believers\u2019: Goldman Sachs doubles down on crypto skepticism despite Wall Street embracing Bitcoin ETFs",
        "content": "Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Wealth Management, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview this week that despite all the recent hype around Bitcoin ETFs her firm isn\u2019t buying into it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not believers in crypto,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not think it is an investment asset class.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you cannot assign a value, then how can you be bullish or bearish?\u201d she added. The crux of her disdain for cryptocurrencies is the difficult task of valuing them, as they don\u2019t produce earnings, dividends, or cash flow, the Journal reported.\n\nHaving guided thousands of wealth advisors, clients, and traders over the past 23 years in her role at the high-profile investment bank, she told the newspaper that clients are aware of the company\u2019s anti-crypto stance and refrain from seeking counsel for investing in the space, despite Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $73,737 last month, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nMossavar-Rahmani said she sees crypto as simply a speculative investment and doesn\u2019t see merit in unregulated markets: \u201cThe rule of law and systems of checks and balances matter.\u201d\n\nBut Mossavar-Rahmani\u2019s stance is at odds with others in traditional finance, who are incorporating\u2014albeit slowly\u2014crypto into their offerings, and in contradiction to rumors that Goldman could be more crypto-friendly behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cThough Goldman Sachs might not have a developed view of Bitcoin or digital assets as long-term investments in portfolios, they are certainly engaging with the ecosystem from an infrastructure perspective,\u201d said Matt Ballensweig, managing director and head of BitGo\u2019s Go Network, in reference to the bank\u2019s digital asset research unit.\n\nThe bank\u2019s global head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott, told Reuters in December that he expects a \u201csignificant uptick\u201d in trading volume of blockchain-based assets within the next year or two, and has also seen increasing client interest in crypto derivatives trading.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cRegardless of view, large banks are going to have to service their client needs, and we\u2019re seeing that unfold now,\u201d added Ballensweig.\n\nElsewhere on the street\n\nSince the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, two of the trading products have been issued by big-name asset managers on Wall Street: BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).\n\nGiven the issuers\u2019 access to mainstream investors and an established customer base, both funds are leading the fiercely competitive Bitcoin ETF race, with the funds amassing almost $60 billion in assets under management so far, according to BitMEX data as of Monday. Of this, IBIT and FBTC have accumulated over $17 billion and $10 billion, respectively\u2014with the latter being the fastest ETF in history to reach this milestone.\n\nMoreover, while Mossavar-Rahmani may publicly condemn investing in crypto, in January CoinDesk reported that Goldman Sachs was in talks to be an authorized participant (AP) for Grayscale and BlackRock ETFs, a role that involves creating and redeeming ETF shares to ensure the products trade closely aligned with their underlying assets.\n\nOther Wall Street players have lined up to fill this role.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s AP roster includes quantitative high-speed trader Jane Street and JPMorgan, SEC filings show. Fellow ETF issuer Valkyrie has also teamed up with Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald to fulfill AP roles, another filing shows.\n\nMeanwhile, that same month, the Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE Arca all filed 19b-4s for SEC approval to allow for the trading of related options, according to notices on their websites.\u00a0On top of this, in February, CoinDesk reported that investment bank Morgan Stanley is allegedly looking into adding spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage platform. The Wall Street behemoth is said to be carrying out due diligence on the products, according to sources close to the matter. If approved, Morgan Stanley would be the first among large registered investment advisor (RIA) networks and broker-dealer platforms to list the ETFs, potentially opening the floodgates for the likes of Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo to turbocharge inflows.\n\n\u201cThese networks and platforms are the addressable market for Bitcoin that the ETFs were always supposed to open up. We know of other big wire houses or advisor platforms that have approved some of these ETFs for trading already,\u201d Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart told Fortune. \u201cI think eventually the vast majority of platforms, if not all, will approve these things.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Towards the end of the just completed first quarter, U.S.-based hedge funds began dumping American equities and shifting capital into European stocks. In an analysis, investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) found that hedge funds \u201chave bought EU equities in nearly 70% of the trading sessions\u201d since the European stock market began to rally in January of this year. Hedge fund exposure to Europe has grown from below 17% at the end of 2023 to roughly 19% at the end of Q1 this year, says Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe move into European stocks comes amid growing concerns that U.S. equities have become too expensive and are in overbought territory. Europe\u2019s main STOXX 600 index is up 7% so far this year, lagging the 10% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index in the U.S. The S&P 500 index currently trades at 21 times forward earnings estimates, while European equities trade at 14 times, according to data from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nIn a recent note to clients, investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said that \u201cEurope has room to catch up with the U.S.\u201d as the discount between both is the deepest it has ever been. Here is hedge fund favorites: three European stocks attracting significant U.S. investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoros Fund, the hedge fund controlled by billionaire investor George Soros, began loading up on shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) last autumn, buying 1.5 million shares worth $138.8 million. Soros Fund is one of several hedge funds that have been buying up stock of the company that makes the popular weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Soaring demand for the weight loss medications has NVO stock up 60% in the last 12 months, including a 25% gain so far in 2024.\n\nHuge demand for its weight loss drugs and rising stock price has made Novo Nordisk Europe\u2019s largest publicly traded company with a current market capitalization of $437.25 billion. Hedge funds have been buying up NVO stock on expectations of strong future earnings and as the company develops a weight loss pill to replace the current injections that are used to administer the medications. A pill is forecast to be a gamechanger for the burgeoning market for weight loss prescriptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nDutch semiconductor company ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is owned by so many hedge funds that in February of this year, Morgan Stanley put out a report stating that ASML is one of Europe\u2019s most \u201cover-owned\u201d stocks. The company specializes in the development and manufacturing of photolithography machines that are essential to the production of computer microchips. Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling demand for ASML\u2019s technology, sending the stock up nearly 40% this year alone.\n\nAppaloosa Management is a hedge funds that\u2019s been betting big on ASML stock since the second half of last year, run by famed investor David Tepper. Appaloosa first opened a position in ASML Holdings stock last August, buying $58 million worth of shares. The hedge fund has steadily increased its stake since then. ASML Holding is growing its role in the global semiconductor market, particularly in China, as AI technologies fuel a renaissance in the sector.\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (SBLK) A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San Francisco\n\nSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) is a lesser known European company and stock. Based in Greece, Star Bulk Carriers is a global shipping company. It operates a fleet of carrier vessels that transports iron ore, coal, and grain between Europe, North America and Asia. SBLK stock gets little attention, but has proven to be a very good investment. It has risen 14% in the last 12 months and 222% in the past five years. The stock also trades at only 13 times future earnings estimates.\n\nSBLK stock pays a hefty quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share, giving it a yield of 6%. So which hedge fund titans own Star Bulk Carriers? None other than Michael Burry, the famed investor profiled in the book and film The Big Short. Burry owns 250,000 shares of the company currently valued at just under $6 million.

        "content": "Making its debut on 06/28/2017, smart beta exchange traded fund Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC) provides investors broad exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend category of the market.\n\nWhat Are Smart Beta ETFs?\n\nFor a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.\n\nMarket cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.\n\nBut, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.\n\nBy attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.\n\nThis area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.\n\nFund Sponsor & Index\n\nThe fund is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds, and has been able to amass over $507.23 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Blend. GSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.20%.\n\nIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.32%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.\n\nRepresenting 20.70% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector; Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.\n\nWhen you look at individual holdings, Dec 23 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYZ3) accounts for about 2.07% of the fund's total assets, followed by Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) and Applied Industrial Technologies Inc (AIT).\n\nGSSC's top 10 holdings account for about 5.59% of its total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nThe ETF has gained about 3.34% and is up roughly 18.70% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 04/02/2024), respectively. GSSC has traded between $51.83 and $65.55 during this last 52-week period.\n\nThe fund has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 21.16% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1318 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\n\nIShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) tracks Russell 2000 Index and the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) tracks S&P SmallCap 600 Index. IShares Russell 2000 ETF has $64.66 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF has $79.40 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Blend.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This article takes a look at the worst places to retire if you have no savings. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retirement uncertainties, you may go to 5 Worst Places to Retire if You Have No Savings.\n\nOn Retirement Uncertainties\n\nAmericans aren\u2019t feeling great about their financial futures. Everything from the pandemic, to the inflation, and market volatility, has significantly dampened their morale. According to a BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) Read on Retirement Survey, only about half of workplace savers feel that they are on track to retire with the lifestyle they desire. This percentage was 68% back in 2021 but dropped to a mere 56% in 2023. So what is hampering retirement confidence for workers around the USA? BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) highlights four key stressors. According to them, increased market volatility, high levels of inflation, recessionary fear, and a lack of retirement income are forcing individuals to delay their retirement plans. While these concerns weigh heavily on savers, the flip side of the coin doesn't yield contrasting findings. The BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) Read on Retirement Report highlights that plan sponsors are just as worried, with 3 out of 4 revealing their concerns about inflation eroding their participants\u2019 retirement savings.\n\nAdding to the complexity are the myriad financial responsibilities, with retirees struggling with a financial vortex assumingly at play, notes The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). This financial vortex is inhibiting savers from adequately saving for their retirement years. Moreover, a survey from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans now believe they need at least $1.8 million in savings to retire comfortably anyway. Sadly, the median retirement savings for baby boomers stands at $202,000 only. The substantial disparity between retirement savings and the ideal retirement threshold, as highlighted by the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey, is further eroded by the financial challenges identified as a vortex by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). In essence, this points to a stark reality: retirees are inevitably faced with the need to scale down their lifestyles during retirement. This is what a majority of retirees are doing anyway, according to reports by U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) and Hire a Helper.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), the top growth states for 2023 were Texas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. These are the best places to retire with no money, considering the various financial advantages they bring to their residents.\n\n\u201cWhile one-way transactions in 2023 remained below the record-breaking levels we witnessed immediately following the pandemic, we continued to see many of the same geographical trends from U-Haul customers moving between states\u201d.\n\n- John \u201cJ.T.\u201d Taylor, U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) International president.\n\nFor states like Texas and Florida, the advantages are pretty clear. These are one of the few states that don\u2019t tax retirement income,  so all income to the residents goes tax-free at the state level. Add in the advantages of low cost of living and pleasant weather, and these states present themselves as ideal candidates for retirement. Since a majority of retirees largely depend on Social Security benefits only, they may choose to retire to any of the states that don\u2019t tax Social Security benefits, depending on other factors such as proximity to family, healthcare, and other factors important to them. Rightly so, taxes shouldn\u2019t be the only factor to consider for potential retirees making a move.\n\n\u201cWhether you're a retiree, a remote worker, or just looking for a change of scenery, the idea of pulling up stakes for purportedly greener pastures isn't that unusual these days. However, the tax implications can be profound, so it's smart to take a hard look before you break out the packing tape\u201d.\n\n-Hayden Adams, director of tax and financial planning at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) Center for Financial Research.\n\nIn conclusion, it is safe to say that potential retirees are largely interested in retiring to places that can give them the best bang for their buck. We already have crafted a list of the best places to retire if you have no savings, here is a list of worst places to steer clear of. 15 Worst Places to Retire If You Have No Savings\n\nf11photo/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of worst places to retire if you have no savings, we began by listing out the worst states to retire on social security and the worst states to retire in 2024. Next, we picked out several retirement destinations that are ideal for retirees in terms of amenities, climate, and healthcare but have been getting expensive over the years. Next, we scored them on their cost of living, median home prices, and rents to come up with a final Insider Monkey score. Places were ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores. Median home prices mentioned are from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) and Realtor, while rents are sourced from websites such as Zillow and Zumper.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the worst places to retire if you have no savings:\n\n15. Austin, Texas\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 119.1\n\nMedian Home Price: $639,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $1,718\n\nThe first pick for our list of worst places to retire if you have no savings is Austin, Texas. While Texas is a favorite state amongst retirees, not every destination is ideal for those on tight budgets. The cost of living in this city is 19% higher than the national average, while the average rent for a one-bedroom is a tad bit shy of the average Social Security amount retirees are getting this year.\n\n14. Portland, Maine\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 8\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 116.8\n\nMedian Home Price: $720,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,025\n\nExcellent infrastructure, magnificent surroundings, and good access to healthcare means many retirees find Portland well worth every penny. Unfortunately, its high cost of living also means it\u2019s one of the worst places to retire if you have no savings. The median price of a home is $720,000, clearly out of reach of those on a fixed income. Moreover, the average rent of a one-bedroom apartment is $2,025.\n\n13. Miami, Florida\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 18\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 119.9\n\nMedian Home Price: $675,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,499\n\nThe next expensive retirement destination on our list is a pick from the Sunshine State. Since everyone wants to retire to this state because of the climate, taxes, and cost of living, it is slowly getting overcrowded and expensive. In particular, Miami recently made it to our list of Florida cities that are getting too expensive for retirees. According to Redfin, home prices in the past five years have skyrocketed by a whopping 55.6%.\n\n12. Ocean City, New Jersey\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 18\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 119.4\n\nMedian Home Price: $916,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,200\n\nNext up on our list of worst places to retire if you have no savings is Ocean City, New Jersey. The cost of living in this expensive city is 19.4% higher than the national average. The median home price is close to a million, while the rent is expensive enough that it easily exceeds the amount of an average Social Security check.\n\n11. Seattle, Washington\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 19\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 151.6\n\nMedian Home Price: $845,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,017\n\nSeniors who worship art and beauty will find Seattle to be a breathtaking retirement destination. However, the cost of living here is a whopping 51.6% higher than the national average. Home prices and rents are beyond the affordability of the average retiree, which is why those who have small or no nest eggs must steer clear of this destination.\n\n10. Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 21\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 174.9\n\nMedian Home Price: $720,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,030\n\nHawaii may not tax your Social Security income, but that doesn't mean it's a retirement-friendly state. After all, the cost of living is way higher than what an average retiree can afford to pay. The city of Honolulu, in particular, has a cost of living that is 74.9% higher than the national average. The median home price and rent are also expensive for an average retiree. Only those who have fat nest eggs should consider retiring here, otherwise, it is one of the worst places to retire if you have no savings.\n\n9. Washington, D.C.\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 21\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 149.5\n\nMedian Home Price: $590,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,572\n\nEverything from healthcare to housing, food and entertainment, and even rent, is expensive in Washington DC. While it may have all the modern amenities, culture, and healthcare services that a retiree would want in their ideal retirement destination, the price isn't quite affordable for everyone.\n\n8. San Diego, California\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 22\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 148.5\n\nMedian Home Price: $940,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,380\n\nSan Diego ranks eighth on our list of worst places to retire if you have no savings. Overall, the cost of living in this city is 48.5% higher than the national average. The median home price is shy of a million, and rents are outrageously high as well.\n\n7. Boston, Massachusetts\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 26\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 149.4\n\nMedian Home Price:\u00a0 $735,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $2,971\n\nBoston may be a good destination to retire, but it's going to quickly drain all your retirement savings considering the cost of living is almost 50% higher than the national average. Retirees can enjoy world-class healthcare, abundant outdoor spaces, and an extensive transportation network here, all at the cost of their life's worth of savings.\n\n6. New York City, New York\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 28\n\nIM Cost of Living Index: 149.3\n\nMedian Home Price: $825,000\n\nAverage Rent (1-bedroom): $4,167\n\nNew York City may be a dream for many retirees, but it's probably best to keep it that way. Almost everyone knows how expensive living in NYC can be, let alone someone who is on a fixed income. According to our numbers, the cost of living here is 49.3% higher than the national average. Homes are expensive, while rents are outrageously high as well.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Worst Places to Retire If You Have No Savings.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n41 States That Won\u2019t Tax Social Security Income in 2024 20 High Quality Best Foot Creams for Cracked Heels 30 Countries With the Lowest GDP Per Capita in the World\n\nDisclosure: none. 15 Worst Places to Retire If You Have No Savings originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 highest paid CEOs in the US and their college degrees. We have also discussed the relevance of college degrees with CEOs. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees.\n\nIn a dataset of 2,600 CEOs, 8% lacked a college degree, a surprising finding given the rising demand for academic qualifications in the job market. Currently, one-third of positions that previously mandated only a high-school diploma now require a four-year college degree, with one in four roles that once sought a bachelor\u2019s degree now demanding a master\u2019s. Concurrently, 75% of Americans perceive higher education as financially unattainable.\n\nCEOs without degrees get to leadership roles through different avenues. Firstly, many arose from within their respective industries or companies, possessing specialized knowledge and extensive experience in their niche domains. Secondly, they demonstrate exceptional performance, particularly prevalent in sectors like sales where achievements are quantifiable and conspicuous. Lastly, they excel in assembling talented teams, relying on their insights and expertise to drive success.\n\nThe relationship between undergraduate degrees and CEO success varies across industries. While tech sectors often require specialized education, other industries show a broader range of educational backgrounds among CEOs. The significance of pursuing a BA, BS, or BBA in attaining CEO positions remains unclear beyond industry-specific norms.\n\nIn analyzing the educational backgrounds of Fortune 100 CEOs, it's evident that undergraduate degrees play an important role in shaping career trajectories. The most common degrees among CEOs are Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), with 53% holding one of these degrees, while 47% have Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees. Notably, 45% of those with BS degrees pursued business-related fields rather than traditional science or engineering disciplines.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that among the 2023 Fortune 100 CEOs, merely 11.8% obtained undergraduate degrees from Ivy League schools, with even fewer holding Ivy League MBAs. The success stories of CEOs like Doug McMillon of Walmart, who graduated from the University of Arkansas, confirm the value of performance over prestige in the corporate world. Furthermore, the prevalence of CEOs from public universities, such as Tim Cook of Apple Inc (NASDSAQ:AAPL) and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, highlights the accessibility of success beyond Ivy League corridors.\n\nNevertheless, tech industry CEOs predominantly hold undergraduate degrees directly related to engineering. Examples include Tim Cook's degree in industrial engineering and Larry Page's in computer engineering. However, exceptions exist, such as CEOs like Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, who hold degrees in history despite leading financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), let\u2019s look at their latest financial performance.\n\nIn the annual report for the year 2023, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) demonstrated strong financial performance across its business segments. The firm's Global Banking & Markets segment retained its leadership, achieving milestones such as maintaining the top rank in advisory net revenues for the 21st consecutive year and securing prominent positions in equity and debt underwriting. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) excelled in Equities and FICC, achieving its second-highest net revenue year since 2010. This performance translated into tangible growth, with financing revenues across FICC and Equities witnessing a 15% compounded annual growth rate since 2019, reaching nearly $8 billion in 2023.\n\nFor investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) showcased impressive returns over the past five years. Book value per share increased by approximately 50 percent, outperforming peers, while the stock price increased by around 130 percent, compared to an average of approximately 60 percent among peers. Furthermore, the quarterly dividend more than tripled during this period.\u00a0 Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024 and beyond, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) remains focused on key priorities outlined by its leadership, including serving clients with excellence, being an employer of choice, and delivering strong shareholder returns.\n\nOn the other hand, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) faced a downturn in profits, primarily due to $3.7 billion in one-time charges and a decline in interest income as it invested more to retain customer deposits. Despite this setback, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives remain optimistic about the US economic landscape, highlighting consumer resilience.\n\nThe financial performance of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) garnered mixed reactions from analysts. While the bank managed to exceed estimates by reporting a profit of 70 cents per share, excluding one-off charges, some analysts noted its underperformance compared to peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Despite challenges in this domain, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) exhibited strength in other areas, such as trading and investment banking.\n\nLooking ahead, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) anticipates modest growth in loans, expecting a low-to-mid single-digit percentage increase in 2024. However, the bank foresees continued challenges in net interest income, projecting a decline in the first and second quarters before a potential recovery in the latter half of the year. 20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees\n\nA successful CEO in a modern office with a sweeping view of the financial district.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the highest paid CEOs in the US, we relied on data compiled by the AFL-CIO Executive paywatch about annual compensation of CEOs in the US. We then looked at the individual profiles of these CEO\u2019s through their business websites or official linkedin to identify their college degrees. Please note that we excluded two names from our list i.e, Austin Russell and Tomer Weingarten. Austin Russell was a college drop out and Tomer Weingarten didn\u2019t attend college after high school.\n\nPlease note that Elon Musk was not in the original list by AFL-CIO, probably because Musk doesn't have a traditional salary and his salary is often tied with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s financial performance. However, we have added Musk to the list, given his consistently high compensation packages which have also sparked debates recently.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "3 Cheap Bank Stocks You\u2019ll Regret Not Buying in 2024",
        "content": "The banking sector is a cornerstone of a healthy economy, and cheap bank stocks present an enticing opportunity for discerning investors. However, with numerous players in the field, choosing the right ones for your portfolio requires careful consideration.\n\nWhile the failure of some regional banks has cast a shadow over the industry, several key players are trading at attractive valuations. These cheap bank stocks offer the potential for significant growth with strong balance sheets and improving fundamentals. With improving macroeconomic factors in the economy, these three bank titans are set to outperform over the next decade.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the top three cheap bank stocks to buy now!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lettering on a corporate office in New York City.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stands tall as the largest bank in the U.S. by assets. The company boasts a diversified stream of revenues encompassing commercial banking, consumer banking, investment banking, and asset management.\n\nJPMorgan Chase benefits from a global presence, strong brand recognition, and a history of consistent profitability. In the last two years, the company benefited from higher interest rates, translating into significant net interest income expansion. Additionally, they capitalized on the regional banking crisis after acquiring First Republic\u2019s consumer loan assets at a steep discount.\n\nLooking out to the end of 2024, the company is not expected to see significant growth as interest rates come down. But they are in a great position financially and will continue growing as the banking industry and economy recovers. Strong consumer spending is a healthy sign that JPM will be able to manage capital efficiently and grow its net interest income and EPS. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) of 12, JPM is one of the best cheap bank stocks to snap up in March.\n\nBank of America (BAC) bank of america stock\n\nSource: PL Gould / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is the second largest bank in the United States, with total assets of approximately $3.18 trillion. While the macroeconomic backdrop did not favor BAC nearly as much as its opposition, they\u2019re set to benefit from an improving economy.\n\nBank of America is up nearly 10% year-to-date as Wall Street digests the possibility of rate cuts in the back half of this year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell reiterated at the latest FOMC meeting that three rate cuts are on the horizon. Ultimately, this is bullish for large banks where risk appetite will likely increase over the coming years. But this is not the only reason to take a closer look at the stock.\n\nIn fourth quarter, average loans and leases increased 4% YOY to $313 billion. Furthermore, they\u2019re beginning to see an uptick in client activity through their consumer banking and global wealth management divisions. Presently, BAC boasts a trailing P/E of 12 with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Although the banking sector has largely been avoided over the past couple of years, their valuation is certainly compelling for long-term investors.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) The Goldman Sachs logo is displayed on a smartphone in front of a multi-color background.\n\nSource: Volodymyr Plysiuk / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a titan in the world of investment banking, with a long history of advising corporations and governments on mergers, acquisitions and capital market transactions. The past two years have been slow but investors are looking past it with strengthening macroeconomic tailwinds.\n\nGoldman Sachs revenue was down 2% in fiscal 2023, largely driven by weaker growth in their global banking and markets division. Industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions were down substantially, as higher interest rates severed business confidence and deal flow. Furthermore, revenue from advisory fees fell significantly and it didn\u2019t help that operating expenses rose 11% YOY.\n\nHowever, Goldman\u2019s asset and wealth management division saw continued strength, which is likely to continue in 2024. Net revenues were up 4% from 2022, partially led by higher net deposit spreads and balances. Goldman Sachs also has a healthy dividend yield of 2.70%, and they have grown their dividend at a 20% compounded annual growth rate over the last decade. As investors look forward to the prospect of lower interest rates in 2024, GS is among the top cheap bank stocks to keep on your radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Indian oil refiners, Russia\u2019s largest customers after China since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, won\u2019t accept tankers owned by Russia\u2019s state-run Sovcomflot PJSC due to sanctions risks, hampering flows.\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, continued drone strikes by Kyiv are crimping Moscow\u2019s crude-refining capabilities. In addition, a terrorist attack in the capital over the weekend left more than 130 dead. The assault was claimed by Islamic State, although President Vladimir Putin and Kremlin officials hinted at Ukrainian involvement.\n\nCrude is headed for a third monthly gain as OPEC+ presses on with output curbs. While China\u2019s tough outlook has been a headwind, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said Beijing was stepping up policy support to spur growth, and that systemic risks were being addressed. Reflecting the bullish mood, money managers\u2019 net-long positions on Brent have risen to the highest in more than a year.\n\nTo get Bloomberg\u2019s Energy Daily newsletter into your inbox, click here.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "Should Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
        "content": "Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/17/2015.\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $12.60 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.\n\nBlend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.\n\nCosts\n\nCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.25%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.30% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.49% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 26.33% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nGSLC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of large-capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF return is roughly 10.77% so far this year and is up about 32.39% in the last one year (as of 03/22/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $78.22 and $103.91.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 17.03% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 452 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSLC is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.\n\nThe iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $450.81 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $532.63 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.\n\nBottom-Line\n\nPassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) shareholders have earned a 19% CAGR over the last five years",
        "content": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) share price has soared 109% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. We note the stock price is up 1.1% in the last seven days.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Goldman Sachs Group actually saw its EPS drop 2.1% per year.\n\nBy glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.\n\nOn the other hand, Goldman Sachs Group's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 6.9% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.\n\nThe company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nGoldman Sachs Group is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Goldman Sachs Group in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Goldman Sachs Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 136%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nGoldman Sachs Group shareholders have received returns of 30% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 19% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Goldman Sachs Group is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently trimmed by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to\u00a0Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 surged to an unprecedented milestone, closing at an historic 5,200 level following signals from the Federal Reserve regarding potential interest rate cuts in 2024. This significant move in the market reflects Wall Street traders' optimism about the prospect of the Fed adjusting its monetary policy in response to economic conditions. The Federal Reserve's indication of a potential shift in its approach to interest rates prompted a rally in short-term bonds, as investors reacted to the reassurance of forthcoming cuts. The central bank's communication, including the 'dot plot' which confirmed expectations of three rate cuts within the year, provided clarity to market participants and fueled confidence in future economic stability. This development comes amid ongoing global economic shifts, including challenges within China's property market, as highlighted by Bain Capital's assessment that there is no immediate solution to the issues faced. Despite these broader economic concerns, the Fed's decision to maintain rates unchanged while signaling potential cuts has injected optimism into financial markets. The rally in equities was widespread, with various sectors experiencing gains, particularly those that had previously underperformed, such as small-cap stocks. This suggests a broad-based confidence in the resilience of corporate profits, bolstered by the anticipated supportive monetary policy. Moreover, the outperformance of short-term Treasury bonds underscores the shifting sentiment among traders, who now anticipate the possibility of the Fed's initial rate adjustment occurring as early as June. This heightened expectation reflects a dynamic market response to evolving economic signals and central bank communications. Overall, the surge in the S&P 500 and the broader market rally signal investor confidence in the Federal Reserve's commitment to navigating economic challenges and supporting continued growth through strategic monetary policy adjustments.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to CNBC, the Bank of England is anticipated to maintain its interest rates at 5.25% amid recent economic data showing a decline in headline inflation to 3.4% in February, the lowest level since September 2021. This drop, along with weaker labor market indicators, has fueled speculation about potential rate cuts. With the UK economy slipping into a technical recession at the end of 2023 due to various factors including a gas supply shock following the Ukraine crisis, the Bank of England is under pressure to support economic recovery. Economists are divided on the timing of rate cuts, with some suggesting a possible reduction as early as June, aligning with market expectations. Despite the encouraging inflation figures, policymakers remain cautious, with uncertainties surrounding the extent and timing of rate adjustments. The Bank's decision may hinge on further data, particularly on wage growth and services inflation, with some analysts suggesting a more prudent approach towards rate cuts, possibly in August. While the possibility of rate cuts signals a shift towards a less stringent monetary policy, uncertainties persist regarding the exact timing and extent of such measures. The Bank of England continues to monitor economic indicators closely as it navigates the path towards sustainable economic recovery.\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on stocks such as U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADVM) by lowering their price targets. For a comprehensive overview of these and other stocks affected by such adjustments, delve into the full article to explore the intricacies of the changes made to their price targets. Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks\n\nPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash\n\n10. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.88 (+2.26%)\n\nOn March 18, BMO Capital Markets reevaluated its perspective on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), a key player in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite reducing the price target to $45 from the previous $55, the market responded positively, with the United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) stock price rising by 2.26% to $39.74 on the closing bell of March 19. BMO Capital Markets maintained a Market Perform rating on the stock amidst its revised outlook. The decision to lower the price target stemmed from a comprehensive analysis of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) first-quarter performance, particularly focusing on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).

The revised target reflects a cautious approach towards United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) ongoing strategic projects and potential risks associated with its transactions. While the company's strategic initiatives are reportedly progressing as planned, the lack of recent updates on its future outlook, particularly regarding the transaction with Nippon, raised concerns. Additionally, heightened political pressure further contributed to the decision to lower the price target.\n\n09. NIKE, Inc.

(NYSE:NKE) of change of strategy: Fast forward a few years and Nike has had a change of strategy that was an Exocet to shoe industry retailers. Nike (who do not sell on Amazon) decided (accurately) that they had the hot product and wanted to drive sales through their own (mostly online) channels. They wanted to capture the retail margin.\n\nNike used to have 30,000 wholesale arrangements (retailers who sold their product). They cut this number sharply, down to 3000 and told people they were going to 1800. Small shoe retailers lost their core brand. Many failed\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n08.

It has amassed assets over $492.26 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Small Cap Blend\n\nWith more potential comes more risk, and small cap companies, with market capitalization below $2 billion, epitomizes this way of thinking.\n\nTypically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.\n\nCosts\n\nWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.33%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing.

Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Dec 23 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYZ3) accounts for about 2.07% of total assets, followed by Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) and Applied Industrial Technologies Inc (AIT).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 5.59% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nGSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF has lost about -0.02% so far this year and it's up approximately 19.80% in the last one year (as of 03/20/2024).

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia said a lawsuit Goldman Sachs Group Inc. initiated amid festering disagreement involving the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal gives the country a chance to review a contentious settlement it had previously struck with the bank.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago\u2019s Most Elite Neighborhood What Happens If Trump Can\u2019t Post His $454 Million Bond\n\nSecond Finance Minister Amir Hamzah Azizan told the country\u2019s parliament on Tuesday that the arbitration suit Goldman filed last year in the UK court \u201creopens pathways\u201d for parties to take another look at the deal, and \u201cstep up efforts to recover assets related to 1MDB.\u201d\n\nLooting of the 1MDB investment fund by officials in Malaysia after Goldman helped it raise money spawned a multibillion-dollar scandal and probes across continents. Months after its initial agreement with Malaysia, Goldman admitted to its role in the biggest foreign bribery case in US enforcement history, reaching multiple international settlements exceeding $5 billion.\n\nAs part of a 2020 settlement with Malaysia, Goldman was required to make an interim payment of $250 million if Malaysia didn\u2019t receive at least $500 million of 1MDB assets and proceeds by August 2022, according to Goldman. The US bank has said in public filings that it doesn\u2019t believe an interim payment is required \u2014 a position that the Malaysian government disputes, prompting Goldman to initiate the lawsuit.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said last year he wants to renegotiate the settlement terms and the bank has not been forthcoming.

        "title": "Cash bonuses are down across Wall Street. But not for some top execs.",
        "content": "Cash bonuses fell across Wall Street during a challenging 2023, according to a new report, but some bosses were able to buck that trend.\n\nCash payouts for New York City securities employees dropped by an average of 2% to $176,500, according to estimates released Tuesday by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. He attributed that caution to \"market volatility\" and an influx of younger workers who pulled down the average.\n\nThe caution didn\u2019t suppress cash amounts that went to some top executives at Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks. Those bonuses were up for the CEOs of Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), according to recent filings.\n\nTwo exceptions were JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who had a cash bonus of $5 million that was unchanged, and Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, who didn\u2019t receive his bonus in cash. Dimon\u2019s overall compensation rose, while Moynihan\u2019s dropped.\n\nOther top bank executives saw their cash bonuses increase. They include three of CEO David Solomon's top lieutenants at Goldman Sachs, including chief operating officer John Waldron. His cash bonus rose 30%, to $11.26 million. John Waldron, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe past year was a challenging one across all of Wall Street as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy. In fact, it was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nA lot is riding on a Wall Street revival that sticks in 2024. That's because banks expect to see their traditional lending income drop as demand falls and margins get squeezed.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeals are picking up significantly compared to this time last year after a string of major deals announced in the US, including credit card lender Capital One (COF) saying it would acquire rival Discover Financial Services (DFS) for roughly $35 billion.\n\nThese pacts could mean hundreds of millions in new fees for some of the biggest banks. Morgan Stanley, Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup all had a hand in at least one of the transactions thus far in 2024.\n\nThe fortunes of these firms contribute mightily to the fortunes of New York state and New York City, DiNapoli\u2019s office said Tuesday.\n\nThe securities industry employed 198,500 workers last year in New York City, a 3.6% increase from 2022. Bonuses accounted for 7% of total tax collections for New York City in the city\u2019s 2023 fiscal year.\n\nWhile the city remains the hub of finance in the US, its share of the industry\u2019s jobs has been declining over time, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The peak was 2000, and employment is now 1.3% lower than it was that year.\n\nOther parts of the US, particularly Texas, have emerged in recent decades as huge employment centers for the finance industry. In December, Texas actually employed more finance workers than New York State, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nThe comptroller told reporters Tuesday that lower bonuses mean lower tax revenues for the state and New York City but \"there's no negative drag\" given that both government offices had anticipated larger declines in their budgets.\n\nWall Street's total cash bonus pool of $33.8 billion for 2023 was up slightly by $100 million from a year ago but down 21% from 2021 and 9% from 2020.\n\n\"We need New York to continue to be the global capital for finance because we all benefit from Wall Street when it is profitable,\" DiNapoli added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

If you want to see our discussion on the US and international economies, head directly to Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy.\n\nIn the beginning of 2023, investors were cautiously optimistic about inflation cooling down and anticipated interest rate cuts, while also keeping an eye out for signs of an economic recession and lower corporate earnings. However, the economy outperformed these expectations, driven by higher-than-expected consumer savings, increased fiscal spending, and looser financial conditions. This led to a 25% increase in the S&P 500 Index in 2023, bringing the benchmark close to its record high from January 2022. The enthusiastic market rally at the end of 2023 has resulted in overvalued stocks, particularly as investors were encouraged by the Federal Reserve's indication in December that rate cuts could be imminent.\n\nLooking ahead, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Global Investment Committee suggests that investors should adopt a more cautious approach, as 2024 is more likely to be an average year for markets rather than another year of double-digit growth. Analysts are predicting 2024 US corporate earnings to be around $242 per share, assuming that companies will continue to expand their profit margins. However, this estimate may be overly optimistic, considering that US economic growth is expected to taper off from last year's rapid pace of about 7% to around 4% this year. This slowdown could lead to a decrease in sales volume and pricing power for companies. Additionally, corporations may have already realized the benefits of lower manufacturing costs and declining oil and raw material prices, which may not contribute as significantly to improved margins in the future. Morgan Stanley believes that 2024 should be a time for balance, both for investors' expectations and their portfolios.\n\nLooking at the international landscape, economists predict that the European economy is poised for a year of transition after a turbulent 2023, with key challenges like high inflation and increasing interest rates expected to diminish. CNBCnoted that despite the challenging economic conditions in the Eurozone, the pan-European Stoxx 600 stock index ended the year 12.6% higher, driven by optimism about potential monetary policy changes in 2024 by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Stock markets in Europe and globally have started 2024 on a more uncertain note, awaiting new data and signals from central banks. Global markets saw a rally in the final months of 2023, as bond yields retreated on hopes that the Fed and ECB would start cutting interest rates early in 2024. However, the ECB has not yet indicated any immediate easing of policy, despite market expectations for a rate cut in March. Jari Stehn, Chief European Economist at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhile wage growth is still firm and the labour market remains resilient, we expect both to soften in 2024 and look for core inflation to reach 2% year-on-year in [the fourth quarter of 2024], much earlier than projected by the ECB. As a result, we see earlier and faster policy rate cuts than implied by the Governing Council\u2019s recent communication.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Chinese economy in 2023 faced challenges as it emerged from COVID lockdown. Initially, there was a surge in business activity, especially in the services sector. However, this boost was short-lived, and the property market's troubles intensified. The distress faced by Country Garden Services Holdings Company Limited, one of China's major private developers, had a ripple effect, shaking business and investor confidence. The property market woes spilled over into consumer sentiment and strained local government finances. To address these issues, policymakers took steps such as policy rate cuts and fiscal support. These measures helped soften the economic impact but did not lead to a significant uptick in economic activity. As we enter 2024, there are known challenges ahead, but uncertainty remains about the future. While policymakers have outlined their goals and plans, there are doubts about how these will be implemented and their effectiveness.\n\nIn South Asia, India's $4 trillion stock market is attracting significant investments from both domestic and foreign investors, positioning itself as a rapidly growing alternative to China. Despite concerns about overpriced shares, upcoming elections, and regulatory uncertainties, investors are showing confidence in India's market potential. The NSE Nifty 50 Index has surged by a third in the past months, with foreign inflows reaching $20 billion in 2023, according to India's national depository data. In 2024, India's appeal is increasing as global investors seek alternatives to Chinese markets. There is also growing anticipation that the national elections this year will result in Prime Minister Narendra Modi securing a third term, further bolstering investor confidence in India's economic prospects.\n\nSimilarly, the Japanese stock market had a remarkable 2023, with the Nikkei 225 Index posting its fastest gain in a decade, reaching its highest level since the end of Japan's bubble economy in 1989. The Tokyo Stock Price Index also saw a rise, marking its fourth-best annual performance since 2001 by mid-November 2023 in local currency terms. As perForbes, the positive trend in Japanese equities is expected to continue in 2024, supported by favorable market conditions and regulatory environment, along with backing from influential investors. Despite global challenges such as high interest rates, sluggish economic growth, and persistent inflation, major institutional investors like BlackRock remain optimistic about Japan's prospects. BlackRock announced in September 2023 that it would increase its investment in the world's second-largest economy. The BlackRock Institute stated:\n\n\u201cWe turn even more positive on Japanese equities, going overweight due to strong earnings, share buy backs and other shareholder-friendly corporate reforms.\u201d\n\nThis article discusses some of the best performing sector and international ETFs that provide investors with access to stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and ATI Inc.

Diversified Stock Portfolio: 11 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy\n\nA portfolio manager in an open-plan trading floor, demonstrating the company's financial agility.\n\nDiversified Stock Portfolio: Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy\n\n11. SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 44.02%\n\nThe SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ) aims to mirror the total return performance of the EURO STOXX 50 Index, which represents some of the largest companies in the 20 EURO STOXX Supersector Indexes. Launched on October 15, 2002, the ETF has assets under management totaling $3.28 billion as of March 14, 2024, with its portfolio comprising 50 stocks. The fund has a gross expense ratio of 0.29% as of March 17, 2024.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is the top holding of the SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ). The company specializes in the development, production, marketing, sale, and maintenance of advanced semiconductor equipment systems used by semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), up from 57 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in the company, with 4.97 million shares valued at $3.76 billion.\n\nIn addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and ATI Inc. (NYSE:ATI), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best stocks to add to your stock portfolio.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world\u2019s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.\u201d\n\n10. BNY Mellon International Equity ETF (NYSE:BKIE)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 46.57%\n\nThe BNY Mellon International Equity ETF (NYSE:BKIE) aims to mirror the performance of the Solactive GBS Developed Markets ex United States Large & Mid Cap Index NTR. It offers investors exposure to global stocks through a passively managed, low-cost index strategy with full portfolio transparency, making it a good pick for investors\u2019 stock portfolio. Launched on April 22, 2020, the fund has amassed net assets amounting to $616.37 million as of March 15, 2024, with an expense ratio of 0.04%.

On March 7, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)'s stock reached a record peak, with shares climbing as much as 7.5% following positive outcomes from an initial clinical study of its new oral weight-loss medication, Amycretin.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), compared to 51 funds in the previous quarter. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 14.13 million shares worth $1.46 billion.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAs we discussed in last quarter\u2019s commentary, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a newer addition to the strategy. Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company\u2019s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.\u201d\n\n9.

We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.\u201d\n\n7.

Though we do not currently own it in the Portfolio, Taiwan Semiconductor was one of the larger relative detractors from performance during the quarter due to its strong performance and comparatively greater index weight.\u201d\n\n6. iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (BATS:IEO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 79.11%\n\nThe iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (BATS:IEO) aims to reflect the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index, which consists of US stocks in the oil and gas exploration and production sector.

The company has an extensive resource base of high-quality drilling inventory in the U.S. and various international locations as well as a growing liquified natural gas business. In our view, the depth and quality of ConocoPhillips\u2019s inventory is a competitive differentiator that is not fully captured in today\u2019s share price. Over the next 10 years, we believe ConocoPhillips will be able to return more than 100% of its current market cap to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while growing its production at a mid-single-digit annual pace. We believe ConocoPhillips is also among the best managed companies in the oil and gas industry and we are impressed by its history of accretive capital allocation under CEO Ryan Lance. The stock has meaningfully underperformed the broader market year-to-date and is an attractive addition to our portfolio.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now 11 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now 11 Oversold Biotech Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Stephanie Cohen, one of the most powerful women at Goldman Sachs, is leaving the storied investment bank after nearly 25 years to join the IT company Cloudflare as chief strategy officer.\n\nWith her departure, Cohen will become the latest key executive to exit Goldman since the start of the year. In January, the bank said Jim Esposito, co-head of banking and markets, would leave after nearly 30 years, while Julian Salisbury, a long-time executive and most recently CIO of asset and wealth management, joined Sixth Street Partners as a partner and co-CIO.\n\nCohen, who joined Goldman in 1999 as an analyst in the mergers and acquisitions group, was named a partner in 2014 and became chief strategy officer in 2018. In September 2020, Cohen and Tucker York were tapped to co-lead Goldman\u2019s consumer and wealth management business, which included Marcus, the firm\u2019s ill-fated foray into consumer banking.\n\nIn late 2022, Goldman reorganized and narrowed its ambition related to consumer banking. It moved Marcus into its asset and wealth-management business and put Cohen in charge of Platform Solutions, which is considered Goldman\u2019s fintech unit. Last summer, Cohen went on personal leave and was not expected to return.\n\nCohen had been one of two women to run a revenue-generating business at Goldman. The other is Beth Hammack, co-head of the global financing group, but she\u2019s retiring after more than 30 years at the bank.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Monday, Cohen called Goldman an astonishing institution made up of incredible individuals. \u201cMore than anything else I want to do something that matters with world-class people and in an environment that fosters learning and creativity. I have had the privilege of doing that these last 25 years at Goldman Sachs and cannot wait for what lies ahead!\u201d Cohen wrote.\n\nCohen is expected to start at Cloudflare in the coming weeks, a person familiar with the situation told Fortune.\n\nMatthew Prince, Cloudflare\u2019s cofounder and CEO, said Cohen had her choice of potential suitors.\n\n\"Some of the best and brightest executives in the world see Cloudflare as the next iconic tech company, and they\u2019re betting their careers on that,\u201d Prince said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to working with Stephanie, and welcoming her to the team in our pursuit of building the next iconic tech company.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Goldman (GS) Closes GreenSky Sale in Pivot From Consumer Finance",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS has completed the sale of GreenSky, its home-improvement lending platform, to a consortium that includes KKR, Bayview Asset Management and CardWorks, and is led by investment firm Sixth Street Partners.\n\nGreenSky offers point-of-sale (POS) technology to connect home improvement contractors with consumers for loan originations.\n\nGreenSky was acquired by GS in 2022 for $1.7 billion. However, in October 2023, the company announced intentions to dispose of the business in a major business restructuring initiative.\n\nWhen the sale was announced, David Solomon, chairman and CEO of Goldman, stated, \u201cThis transaction demonstrates our continued progress in narrowing the focus of our consumer business. While GreenSky is an attractive business, we are focused on advancing the strategy we laid out for our two core franchises. In Global Banking & Markets, we\u2019ve improved our wallet share and are demonstrating strong growth in financing activities; and across our Asset & Wealth Management platform, we are making very strong progress towards both our fundraising and management fee targets.\u201d\n\nIn fourth-quarter 2023, the company completed the sale of a majority of the GreenSky installment loan portfolio. It also entered an agreement with General Motors GM to transition GM\u2019s credit card program to another issuer to be chosen by GM.\n\nGS will now focus on its two core businesses \u2014 the Global Banking and Markets segment, and the Asset and Wealth Management segment.\n\nIn 2023, Goldman was ranked in the top position in worldwide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&As), equity and equity-related offerings, and common stock offerings. This likely gives it an edge over its peers. Strong M&A activities drove record investment banking (IB) revenues in 2021 on the back of stellar performances in financial advisory, equity underwriting and debt underwriting activities. However, IB revenues declined in 2022 and 2023 due to muted global M&A deal value and volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nNonetheless, Goldman witnessed strong improvement in its M&A backlog in fourth-quarter 2023. It expects various initial public offerings in 2024. We believe that robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, signs of growing M&A and underwriting pipelines, and the company\u2019s decent IB backlog will support IB revenues in the upcoming period. We expect IB fees to rise 8.8% and 3.4% year over year in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 12.8% in the past six months, outperforming the\u00a0industry\u2019s growth of 11.8%.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 51 best cities to retire on $3,500 a month. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the struggle of American workers, you may go to 10 Best Cities to Retire on $3,500 a Month.\n\nThe Struggle of American Workers in an Unstable Financial Landscape\n\nAccording to retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, the retirement system in the United States of America has left behind the bottom 90% of workers. Unable to support themselves on Social Security benefits and savings, these people often find themselves working into old age. Credit Karma, a financial services firm, reveals that an estimated 27% of people aged 59 or older have no retirement savings at all, further reinforcing the need to work post-retirement to support themselves. These findings are noteworthy considering the Social Security trust fund is all set to be depleted by 2034, resulting in a cut in benefits for the millions of Americans who depend on it.\n\nOf the 67 million retirees depending on Social Security, a depleted trust fund implies that each beneficiary ought to receive only 77 cents for every $1 in benefits- with the poorest Americans being affected the most. However, it\u2019s not that Americans don\u2019t want to save for retirement, but rather that they don't have an option otherwise. As noted by a retirement survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), a growing number of US workers are finding it hard to save for retirement altogether. As of 2022, 47% of the respondents in the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey revealed that they believed they were \"very likely\" to reach their retirement goals. However, this percentage went down to 37% in a year.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) accurately captures this phenomenon in what they consider to be a \u201cfinancial vortex\u201d. Due to this financial vortex, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) warns that workers fail to understand what to prioritize, and this is in turn pushing back their retirement by many years. This is true despite many Americans having improved their level of savings in the past year. However, the complex financial landscape, characterized by competing responsibilities like credit card debt, saving for college, and providing financial support to family members, has disrupted savings strategies. This has resulted in a delay in retirement plans by four or more years for 21% of respondents, according to a Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) retirement report.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"While retirement sentiment improved over last year, the financial vortex remains a huge problem for many workers and retirees. Its challenges are largely immune to improvement in markets and the economy and will continue to impact new generations of retirement savers\u201d.\n\n-Chris Ceder, senior retirement strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)\n\nWhile the above scenario may be true for the bottom 90% of American workers, Empower, a financial services company, reveals that more than half of Americans may be in the job market post-retirement and open to work \u201cindefinitely\u201d. This report implies that while a majority of workers do work for the money after retirement, many more do so for reasons such as personal fulfillment \\. Nevertheless, one reality for a large portion of retirees in the US is that they live on fixed incomes. For this reason, they must learn to live on either their social security benefits or an amount that includes their minimal savings. For a certain portion of retirees, this figure is near about $3,500. Having covered lists for the best places to retire on $3,000 a month, best places to retire on $2,000 a month, and even best places to retire on $1,500 a month, let\u2019s see what the best places to retire on $3,500 a month are. 51 Best Cities to Retire on $3,500 a Month\n\nCopyright: sepavo / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of best cities to retire on $3,500 a month, we updated our previous list of best places to retire on $3,500 a month.

The overshooting commitment, by which the BOJ commits to increasing the monetary base, is likely to be scrapped too, he said.\n\nIn a survey of 50 economists published by Bloomberg News last week, a slim majority had forecast the BOJ would end the world\u2019s last negative rate in April. After that survey, Japan\u2019s largest union group announced stronger-than-expected annual wage deals, fueling speculation of a March move.\n\nWinners and Losers From Ueda Ditching Negative Rates in Japan\n\nThe central bank has long pursued a goal of achieving sustainable 2% inflation.

        "title": "3 Incredibly Cheap Bank Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "The market has rallied impressively over the past several months, with the S&P 500 index reaching all-time highs that confirm a new bull market is underway in stocks. With this recent rally, some stock valuations may be stretched, making it harder to find deals. Good news for you: There are still plenty of deals to be had in the market today.\n\nBank stocks have been slow to recover amid the high interest rate environment, which has been a headwind to businesses. However, there are at least three bank stocks that still trade at incredibly cheap valuations and could be poised to take off. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Citigroup\n\nCitigroup(NYSE: C) is one of the largest banks in the U.S. but has struggled in recent years as its wide-ranging worldwide business endeavors has spread it too thin. Not only that, but a few years ago, the bank was fined $400 million for deficiencies in internal controls, risk management, and data governance. As a result, Citigroup's performance struggled compared with that of its banking peers. C Total Return Level data by YCharts\n\nBecause of its recent history of underperformance, Citigroup trades at a dirt cheap 33% discount to its tangible book value. In comparison, Bank of America and Wells Fargo trade at a 44% and 54% premium to book value, respectively.\n\nCitigroup's cheap valuation is one aspect that makes it appealing. However, the guidance of CEO Jane Fraser, if implemented, could give Citigroup a higher valuation. Fraser took over as CEO in 2021 and laid out plans to eliminate less profitable operations while leaning into those that will boost its efficiency. As part of this move, it announced it would wind down 13 global consumer franchises, reduce its workforce, consolidate operations, and streamline its business.\n\nSome analysts are quite optimistic about its strategy. For example, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo believes Citi's stock price could reach $100 over the next three years. While Citigroup has its work cut out for it, its cheap valuation provides some margin of safety and makes it look like a good value stock to buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Goldman Sachs\n\nRising interest rates have dampened investment banking activity over the past several years, impacting Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS), one of the largest investment banks in the world.\n\nIn 2022, rising interest rates created an air of uncertainty around markets, including those for initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions, both bread-and-butter businesses for investment bankers. According to the consulting firm PwC, the IPO markets over the last two years were some of the lowest-volume years in the U.S. In total, there were 175 IPOs in the past two years, well below 2021, which saw a whopping 951 IPOs.\n\nGoldman Sachs' investment banking revenue plummeted 56% over two years ending in 2023. It has also made other moves to consolidate its operations, like winding down its consumer business, which has been struggling for the past several years. The difficult environment has made it tough to be optimistic about Goldman Sachs. Today, the investment bank trades at 16.8 times earnings and just 9.9 times one-year forward earnings.\n\nHowever, IPO markets are showing signs of life, with Reddit, Stripe, and Klarna being some of the most anticipated IPOs that could happen later in the year. If they launch successfully, it could be a good sign that risk appetite is back. If that's the case, Goldman Sachs looks like an excellent bargain stock to pick up today before we see a further pickup in activity.\n\n3. Lending Club\n\nLending Club(NYSE: LC) is a consumer-focused lender that helps consumers refinance their debt and roll it up into personal loans. With credit card debt topping $1.13 trillion, consumers have racked up debt at a time when credit card interest rates are near an all-time high.\n\nThis rising consumer debt could create a massive opportunity for Lending Club. The company started as a peer-to-peer lending platform in 2006 but has transformed into a consumer lender and a bank following its acquisition of Radius Bancorp in 2021. As a result, it holds about 15% to 25% of its highest-quality loans on its books, which can generate net interest income in addition to the revenue it earns for originating and selling its remaining loans to the market.\n\nLendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn told investors, \"We've been preparing our personal loans franchise to meet the historic refinance opportunity ahead.\" To do so, Lending Club is developing products that allow members to sweep credit card balances into payment plans. In other words, customers can \"top up\" an existing personal loan, making it easy to manage their debt balance.\n\nConsumers may consolidate their loans, especially if interest rates fall, benefiting LendingClub's core business. If that's the case, now could be an excellent time to scoop up shares, which are cheaply priced at an 18% discount to tangible book value and 11 times forward earnings, ahead of this historic refinancing opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Citigroup right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Citigroup, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Citigroup wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds details on compensation including directors' pay, paragraphs 2, 5-8)\n\nNEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - The pay of Goldman Sachs' top three executives jumped by an average of nearly 24% in 2023, the Wall Street investment banking company disclosed in a filing on Friday, even as its profit fell last year.\n\nThe compensation committee determined the pay based on factors such as decisive leadership that recognized the need to simplify the firm's strategy and a series of actions that narrowed the focus of the firm.\n\nSince 2022, CEO David Solomon has significantly scaled back Goldman's consumer ambitions by selling assets such as financial technology lender GreenSky at a loss. He also shut down unsecured lending.\n\nLast year Solomon earned $31 million, 24% higher than the previous year. President John Waldron earned $30 million, an increase of nearly 28% over the prior year, and CFO Denis Coleman earned $20 million, up 18% from the previous year.\n\nThe bank's profit fell 24% to $8.52 billion in 2023.\n\nCompensation for top executives had fallen in 2022 after a sharp decline in dealmaking and losses on consumer banking.\n\nThe compensation for Goldman's top directors also went up in 2023.\n\nThe highest paid was Peter Oppenheimer, who received $565,683 in 2023, compared with $515,461 in 2022, the statement said.

        "content": "Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon warned Friday that inflation may prove more difficult to conquer than previously expected after back-to-back reports showed that price pressures within the U.S. economy rebounded at the start of the year.\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders, Solomon said he is optimistic about this year as his firm stands to benefit from a rebound in capital-markets activity, even though prices could remain abnormally high for some time.\n\n\"After years of easy monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, economic conditions tightened at the fastest rate in 40 years, and yet there was not a recession,\" he wrote. \"The U.S. economy has proven more resilient than expected, and markets are predicting rate cuts, though I think inflation may prove stickier than many anticipate.\"\n\nJANET YELLEN WARNS INFLATION DECLINE MIGHT NOT BE 'SMOOTH' David Solomon, chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., during a Bloomberg Television at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference in New York on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2022.\n\nPrices for everything including groceries, new cars and health insurance surged in 2021 and 2022 as the result of rampant inflation, which was caused by COVID-19 pandemic-induced disruptions in the global supply chain, an extremely tight labor market and increased consumer demand fueled in part by stimulus cash.\n\nWhile inflation has fallen considerably from a peak of 9.1% notched during June 2022, it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal. And when compared with January 2021, shortly before the inflation crisis began, prices are up a stunning 18.49%.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nWHY ARE GROCERIES STILL SO EXPENSIVE?\n\nHigh inflation has created severe financial pressures for most U.S. households, which are forced to pay more for everyday necessities like food and rent. The burden is disproportionately borne by low-income Americans, whose already-stretched paychecks are heavily affected by price fluctuations. People shop at a home improvement store in Brooklyn on Jan. 25, 2024, in New York City.\n\nBut progress on inflation has largely flatlined since June, with the consumer price index hovering at or above 3% for the past nine months, stoking concerns on Wall Street over the possibility of \"stagflation.\" Stagflation is the combination of economic stagnation and high inflation, characterized by soaring consumer prices as well as high unemployment.\n\nStory continues\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON\u00a0THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSolomon said that CEOs of multinational corporations have told him that economic conditions, particularly for lower-income consumers, have deteriorated, and they are seeing \"behavioral changes\" as a result.\n\n\"But the Fed now has room to ease if economic conditions start to deteriorate,\" he said.\n\nSolomon also called 2023 a \"year of execution\" for Goldman \u2013 which began with the bank laying off about 3,200 employees, one of the deepest rounds of job cuts ever for the company.\n\n\"We took swift, decisive action to refocus the firm\u2019s strategy while at the same time strengthening our core businesses, and I\u2019m proud of the progress we made,\" he said. \"We put the firm in a stronger position for 2024 and beyond.\"\n\nOriginal article source:Goldman Sachs CEO warns inflation may prove 'stickier' than expected",

        "content": "(Adds details from GSAM executives in paras 9-11, context in paras 2-3)\n\nBy Iain Withers\n\nCANNES, France, March 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Asset Management will resume \"actively investing\" in U.S. commercial real estate this year because the market is bottoming out, the co-head of its real estate business said on Wednesday.\n\nPrices of U.S. offices and other commercial properties such as multi-family apartment blocks have fallen sharply in the face of higher interest rates and for vacancy rates for offices that have soared far more than elsewhere since the pandemic.\n\nThe plunge in prices has rattled confidence in U.S. regional banks with large exposure. Investors gathered in Cannes this week for a property conference said the office sector could struggle to recover, with a Brookfield Asset Management executive calling the U.S. the world's most\n\noversupplied market\n\n.\n\nJim Garman, GSAM's co-head of real estate, said he saw a buying opportunity.\n\n\"The reason is a combination of interest rates coming down, we feel like the market is bottoming out, and because we're starting to see a floor in prices set by buyers who are in the market,\" Garman told Reuters in an interview at the MIPIM conference.\n\nGarman said GSAM, the asset management arm of Goldman Sachs , had begun to deploy more cash in real estate in Europe and Japan over the past three months, without quantifying its investment.\n\nThe underlying strength of the U.S. economy should support a rebound in the U.S. market too, although he cautioned about the speed of a recovery.\n\n\"We don't think its going to be a very sharp V-shaped recovery \u2013 we think we're going to bump along the bottom for a while, as a lot of these over-levered situations in the asset class get worked through,\" he said.\n\nToday's property market downturn is not like the 2008-09 global financial crisis, in part because banks are in better shape and \"have the capital cushion to take action\", Richard Spencer, managing director in GSAM's Real Estate Principal Investments Area, said in Cannes.\n\n\"We're expecting an extended period of deleveraging, rather than a blanket 'extend and pretend' approach or blanket resolutions by lenders. It\u2019s just going to take time to resolve,\" he said.\n\nThe need to green building has also set off a \"capital expenditure supercycle relating to sustainability\", Spencer added.

Made up of the hardest-hit Dow stocks, which also pay out hefty dividend yields, you buy the Dogs at the start of the year, and cash out at the end of the year with hopeful wins in hand.\n\nIn 2023, the Dogs of the Dow returned about 10.1%, as compared to the 14.4% gains on the overall Dow Jones Industrial Average.The 2022 Dogs of the Dow did beat the major indices. In fact, while the Dogs of the Dow stocks fell 1.6% on the year, once you add in the dividend payouts, the Dogs returned 2% on the year. While 2% may not sound like a big win, consider that, in 2022, one of the worst years on record since 2008, the Dow Jones lost about 9%.\n\nAs for 2024, here\u2019s how the Dogs of the Dow have done year to date:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ran from about $380 to $387, and yields 2.84% Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ran from $156 to $159.52, and yields 2.98% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been about flat at $59, yielding 3.26% Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) fell from $285 to a low of $273.75, and yields 3.29% Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) fell from about $50 to $49.50, yielding 3.23% IBM (NYSE:IBM) jumped from about $160 to $195.95, yielding 3.39% Chevron (NYSE:CVX) ran from about $148 to $149.88, yielding 4.35% Dow (NYSE:DOW) ran from about $54 to $56.61, yielding 4.95% 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) fell from about $107 to $93.90, yielding 6.43% Verizon (NYSE:VZ) ran from $37.10 to $39.51, yielding 6.73%\n\nOf those, we expect these three top Dogs of the Dow of 2024 to run even more.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

Helping, the company\u2019s WatsonX AI platform is its newest AI and data platform that allows, \u201cAI builders to train, test and deploy generative AI capabilities powered by foundation models,\u201d according to TechTarget.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetter, IBM is seeing massive improvements to productivity thanks to the AI boom. And, as IBM noted late last year, \u201cIf you leverage AI correctly, there\u2019s probably $10 trillion of productivity that will be reaped by companies and governments over the next 10 years,\u201d\u00a0as quoted by CNBC.\n\nEven better, the company just forecast full-year revenue growth in the mid-single digits, which is higher than expectations for 2.8%. It also guided for stronger free cash flow of $12 billion for the year, driven by higher profitability.\n\n\u201cInvestment firm BofA labeled the company\u2019s free cash flow guide as \u2018the standout metric\u2019, comfortably beating its expectations of $11 billion \u2013 $11.5 billion. For UBS, the company\u2019s full-year free cash flow outlook was a positive surprise compared to its estimate of $11 billion,\u201d\u00a0as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon started the year off well but from here, I\u2019d initially like to see VZ challenge $43 again. Helping, Verizon just\u00a0declared a 66.5 cent quarterly dividend, which is payable May 1 to shareholders of record as of April 10.\n\nThat dividend also appears to be safe. Late last year, company CEO Hans Erik Vestberg said Verizon\u2019s \u201cdividend coverage is very healthy. Year-to-date our free cash flow dividend payout ratio is approximately 56%, a significant improvement from a year ago,\u201d as\u00a0quoted by Barron\u2019s.\n\nThe company also just forecast an adjusted EPS range of $4.50 to $4.70 for the full-year. That\u2019s higher than expectations, and is being supported by an impressive increase in wireless subscribers with net additions up about 400,000 in the fourth quarter. Even better, its free cash flow (FCF) is on the rise, with its FCF up to $18.7 billion for 2023 from $14.1 billion in 2022.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) An image of an old red and rusted fridge door with a metal \"Coca-Cola\" logo handle and white embroidered text that reads \"Drink\" in a small font and \"Coca-Cola\" below in a very large font.\n\nSource: phloxii / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the year began, Coca-Cola has been trading sideways, bouncing around in a tight channel between $59 and $61. Now at the lower range of the channel, I expect for the stock to again pivot higher immediate term. Longer term, I\u2019d like to see KO to break above resistance around $62, with a potential test of $64.\n\nHelping, the company just\u00a0raised its dividend to 48.5 cents, which is payable on Apr. 1 to shareholders of record as of Mar. 15.\n\nTwo,\u00a0KO is still one of Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite stocks. Three, even though it\u2019s been forced to raise prices, its sales are still strong. It fourth quarter EPS of 49 cents came in in-line. Revenue of $10.88 billion \u2014 up about 7% year over year \u2014 beat by $150 million.

        "title": "The AI arms race between the US and China is heating up",
        "content": "Tech billionaires aren\u2019t the only ones fighting for control of AI. The US and China are too.\n\nThe two world superpowers are competing with each other for everything from the intellectual know-how to design AI hardware and software to the raw materials that power artificial intelligence systems. Both are also using government subsidies to spur new advancements.\n\nWhere the US holds a commanding lead at the moment is the development of generative AI systems such as large language models (LLMs), according to Frank Long with Goldman Sachs' (GS) office of applied innovation. These models hoover up existing data and use it as the basis for chatbots like Open AI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnother advantage for the US is that it can place export restrictions on high-performance semiconductors designed by companies like Nvidia (NVDA) that are in intense demand across the AI world. That, for now, is keeping development of the most sophisticated LLMs out of China\u2019s reach, Long said. Nvidia is now one of the world's most valuable companies due to soaring demand for AI computing power. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nChina, however, is countering with its own maneuvers. It is restricting the export of chipmaking metals gallium and germanium to the US while also reportedly amassing a new $27 billion chip fund to back its own major projects.\n\nThe fierce competition for AI talent between the two countries turned up a notch this past week when the US Justice Department unsealed an indictment charging a Chinese national and former Google (GOOG, GOOGL) AI software developer with stealing 500 files of confidential code that the tech giant uses for its supercomputing data centers to train LLMs.\n\nThe government alleged that after stealing the intellectual property the defendant began simultaneously working for rival companies in China.\n\nThe charges \u201care the latest illustration of the lengths affiliates of companies based in the People\u2019s Republic of China are willing to go to steal American innovation,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.\n\n'Horse race'\n\nThe fight for global supremacy of AI was a hot topic of discussion earlier this month at the Web Summit\u2019s annual technology conference in Doha, Qatar, an event that attracted investors and tech executives from around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI leaders from the public and private sectors acknowledged that the US and China currently have the edge. The countries currently rank No. 1 and No. 2 in Tortoise Media'sGlobal AI Index, which measures nations based on AI investment, innovation, and implementation.\n\nBut the leaders also said at the summit that it's too soon to know which countries over time will leverage the technology to the greatest economic and societal advantage. Singapore, for example, is now No. 3 in Tortoise's index after moving up rapidly in recent years. Singapore is climbing the ranks of AI powers. (Photo by Roslan RAHMAN / AFP) (Photo credit should read ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it's not going to be as straightforward of a horse race \u2014 this person or that person, this country or that country,\" Long said. \"It's going to be a full stack with participants in competition\" for the energy, computing power, data, and models needed for AI systems.\n\nLong and his team at Goldman said in a recent white paper they suspect certain geopolitical \u201cswing states\u201d \u2014 like the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea \u2014 may be best positioned to tap the technology and form AI alliances.\n\nOther Asian countries beyond China already have several advantages. Taiwan is home to a cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which produces 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors and 68% of semiconductors worldwide. Engineers work in a cleanroom at the Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute in Hsinchu, Taiwan. (Ann Wang/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJapan and South Korea are also home to leading semiconductor manufacturing and design firms, and they are setting aside more government funds to drive AI advancement.\n\nJapan allocated $13 billion to the technology in its 2023 budget, up from $8.6 billion in 2022, while South Korea committed $470 billion over the next 23 years to create the world\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nOther potential AI hubs could emerge in Europe and the Middle East. The Netherlands \u2014 home to ASML (ASML) \u2014 is already the world\u2019s sole manufacturer of ultraviolet lithography machines, required to fabricate leading-edge semiconductors.

(EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP via Getty Images) (EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images)\n\nThe UAE has a $10 billion fund to invest in late-state technologies, while Israel has also attracted billions in private AI investments.\n\nGlobal power will shift towards nations that produce versus solely consume AI technology, according to Alaa Abdulaal, head of digital foresight for the Riyadh-based multilateral foundation Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO). The group's mission is to recommend government policies that promote access to technology.\n\n\"It cannot be only done by government itself,\" Abdulaal said. \"It needs to take a cooperative approach, where we have at the same table the private sector, public sector, civil society \u2014 all of them sitting together to come up with the right set of frameworks for AI.\"\n\n'Getting much closer'\n\nToday, most countries have adopted, at minimum, a national strategy to develop and protect against the potential risks of AI. And some have cleared the way for regulations, though none have been tested against market forces.\n\nIn March, the EU is expected to adopt new legal restraints around AI. Earlier this year the bloc's member states signaled their agreement with the AI Act, the world\u2019s first comprehensive legislation to regulate the technology.\n\nFederal laws specific to AI don\u2019t exist yet in the US or UK, and it\u2019s unknown whether that will happen.\n\nIn October, President Biden issued an executive order to encourage safe AI development, including privacy protections. More than a dozen US states have adopted multiple AI-related laws. President Joe Biden speaks about government regulations on artificial intelligence systems during an event in the East Room of the White House last year. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe UK, for its part, rolled out a \u201cNational AI Strategy\u201d in 2022 and committed roughly $4 billion in chip development subsidies. The nation has also attracted the third-largest level of private investment in AI, behind the US and China.\n\nState subsidies and export bans may not hold sway forever as nations compete, said Jihad Tayara, CEO of Evoteq, a Dubai-based company that facilitates public-private collaborations to build AI into public infrastructure.\n\n\"It's getting much closer,\" Tayara said of the digital divide, noting that most nations have access to high-speed 5G data capabilities.\n\nAnd human capital, along with access to open-source models, will matter too.\n\n\"Today we're seeing open-source models emerging that are in many use cases equivalent in capability to the absolute most frontier models,\" Long said.\n\nNations that prepare their workforces to develop and implement AI models will gain a considerable edge, Abdulaal said.\n\n\"This opportunity cannot be seen unless we have the right people in place.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 29 US cities where you can retire on $2000 a month. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of social security realities and financial strategies, you may go to 10 US Cities Where You Can Retire on $2000 a Month.\n\nSocial Security Realities and Financial Strategies in 2024\n\nWhat does $1,907 buy in a month? Considering this is the amount on average that a retiree gets from Social Security in 2024, chances are not much. The Bureau of Labor Statistics crunched out the exact figures, stating that the average spending for those aged 65 or older was $4,345 monthly as of 2021. For 44% of these seniors, food costs were the fastest-growing expense for the year, and only 48% of those surveyed managed to keep their overall expenses under $2,000. While numerous retirees aim to minimize their expenses in anticipation of unforeseen costs in the future, for a substantial portion of retirees, this is not a matter of choice. Data from the Federal Reserve further sheds light on this, quoting that 43% of those aged 55- to 64 had no retirement savings at all as of 2022. Their only hope? Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nHowever, saving money for retirement isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea . Many get caught up in a \u201cfinancial vortex\u201d, as revealed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).\n\n\u201cOnly 36% of US workers have three months of income or more saved for emergencies. Unplanned and often unpredictable financial challenges push too many of us off track, and catching up may be difficult. Saving for retirement must remain a top priority\u201d.\n\n- Chris Ceder, Senior Retirement Strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).\n\nWhile saving for retirement is an absolute must, there are three key risks associated with these savings. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) notes that savers are faced with a \u201ccomplex financial backdrop\u201d when saving up money for retirement. More so, there are risks associated with these savings. These are inflation, longevity, and market decline. There is always the risk of rising inflation that will eventually erode the value of your nest egg, the risk that you'll outlive your savings, and even the danger of a downturn that could eventually compromise long-term savings.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo Social Security benefits are the only reliable money that is going to be there for you. Sadly, they are not enough. More importantly, they are all set to be depleted by 2034, leaving potential retirees wondering whether these benefits are even going to be there for them or not. According to the Social Security Administration, even if trust funds do get depleted, some benefits could still be paid. This is because even in the scenario of complete reserve depletion, the anticipated annual income from the trust funds is expected to cover approximately 79% of the program's total cost.\n\n\"What I tell clients is, 'It will be there for you\u2014but there may be some changes. That could mean later retirement dates for future recipients, reduced benefits for retirees who can afford it, or increases to the Social Security payroll tax in order to raise more money\".\n\n- Robert Aruldoss, a senior financial planning analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)\n\nFurther, this is what Mike Townsend from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has to say about the future of Social Security:\n\n\u201cFrom a beneficiary's perspective, any proposed solution likely would be phased in over many years\u2014and people approaching or already in retirement would almost certainly be exempt. After all, many Americans have been planning their retirement with certain assumptions around Social Security in mind, and it would be unfair to upend those assumptions without adequate time to adjust\".\n\n-Mike Townsend, managing director of legislative and regulatory affairs at Schwab from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)\n\nConsidering the above financial landscape for retirees, it's only wise for them to learn how to live comfortably on as little as they can. This figure, considering rent, groceries, and utilities are accounted for, comes down to approximately $2,000 a month. So for those wondering is $2,000 a month good for retirement? The answer largely depends on where you end up retiring to. 29 US Cities Where You Can Retire on $2000 a Month\n\nNagel Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of 29 US cities where you can retire on $2000 a month, we updated our previous list on 25 US cities where you can retire on $2000 a month.

        "title": "15 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "Investing in the stock market comes in all flavors and sizes. Typically, most investors focus on a firm's fundamentals, i.e. its income statement and balance sheet. So for instance, if a company's top and bottom line income grows significantly, then its shares also witness a corresponding increase in valuation. We don't have to look for this principle as the artificial intelligence stock NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s successive earnings reports have demonstrated triple digit growth on several fronts and its shares are at all time high levels.\n\nAnother investing approach is looking at the technical indicators to determine if any favorable market 'winds' are blowing to allow the investor to align their sails for smooth trading. These indicators include historic share price averages, the volume of shares traded, and metrics that determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. Another such indicator is seasonality, which checks to see if any stock market sectors deliver returns by the season.\n\nWhen we talk about seasonality, then since spring has just started, it's best to see which Spring stocks are seeing interest from hedge funds. But before that, a look to see which stock market sectors perform well in spring. On this front, some research from CNBC and StockCharts can help guide us. Since the latter segregates stock indexes by their monthly performance, it makes sense to start our brief look at spring stock market performance by starting from it.\n\nTaking a look at the flagship S&P 500, the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite, and the NYSE Primary, then the first three months of spring offer strong returns across all of these. Considering data for the twelve months of the year between 2005 to 2024, the S&P 500 closed higher in April 84% of the time - the highest for any month during the year. This is also the case for the NYSE's performance, with the same percentage for the same month.\n\nFinally, when we look at how stocks on the NASDAQ Composite perform during spring months, then March and April saw the index close higher 68% of the time, each - for the second highest figure after its performance during July and November. Finally, spring's a good time for stocks especially when we consider that for the S&P and NYSE, May offers the third highest odds for a higher monthly close. Performance in May is particularly interesting when we remember a stock market 'proverb' that calls on investors to 'Sell in May and Go Away', referring to portfolio adjustments before the holidays. Combining this with the data, perhaps one reason why stocks do well in May is due to low liquidity also affecting prices through volatility.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next step in our analysis of the best spring stocks is to see which sectors perform well. On this front, CNBC did some research and determined that the best spring stocks often include companies that operate in the financial services and energy industry. To quote the publication:\n\nCNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.\n\nSo, how are these sectors doing right now? Well, the finance industry remains one of the most dynamic ones in the market. Banks were given a scare earlier this year after the shares of New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) dropped after it reported a surprise loss for the fourth quarter and made allocations for potential turmoil in the commercial real estate industry. The real estate sector's troubles have been exacerbated by record high interest rates, which also led to the fall of several U.S. banks during last year's regional banking crisis in the U.S.\n\nSo, with spring with us, we decided to take a look at some top spring stocks to buy. 15 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best spring stocks, we picked out the financial services and energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors during Q4 2023.\n\nFor these best spring stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now\n\n15.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 oil stocks with the biggest upside. If you want to skip our overview of the oil sector and some recent news, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nWhen we talk about investing in major sectors of the stock market, such as oil stocks, the number of equities that are available for trading on major indexes runs into the hundreds. This means that selecting the right stocks to invest in becomes a tedious process that requires an investor to patiently work through copious amounts of financial data to see whether a share price is justified by a firm's underlying models.\n\nNaturally, this is why the finance industry exists, with the sell side sector hiring teams to analyze stocks and write recommendations. Some such firms include banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). These banks issue hundreds of stock notes each year, and often formulate lists of top firms in sectors such as oil to narrow down potential star stock performers.\n\nOil stocks in particular have been at the center of news coverage for the past couple of years, and despite significant demand up and downswings in the sector, their long term returns still resemble those that are characteristic of stable sectors. For instance, when we look at the five year performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index, the index is up by 16%, a growth that discounts the effects of dividends in providing investors a larger bang for their buck.\n\nIn fact for the oil industry, even though 2023 was a boon in terms of revenue and high profits due to elevated gas prices stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it saw a sector that was still reeling from the effects of post pandemic global shutdowns and travel restrictions. These had ensured that the demand for oil was cut down significantly, and as the implications became clear, the same S&P oil index that is up by 16% over the past five years dropped by more than 30% over the course of a single summer month.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust before this turmoil hit, i.e. in June 2022, Goldman Sachs had started to share its favored oil stocks which the bank's analyst Neil Mehta outlined had the potential for the greatest share price upside. The list was accompanied by a note that identified companies slated to benefit from a boom in global commodity demand and prices right when the global energy industry was undergoing a significant re shift on the supply side and fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) boomed as an alternative to cheap Russian gas.\n\nMehta explained that the list of companies his teams had identified carried the potential of generating strong cash flows and potentially experiencing significant upside revisions down the road. He added that in case of long term crude oil prices hovering around $90, the top oil stocks could provide attractive valuations and end up being important components of a beta barbell investing strategy that allows an investor to focus on high and low risk stocks to strike an adequate balance between hedging a portfolio and seeking return.\n\nSince then, Goldman Sachs has mostly stuck with its oil price forecast, which is important since the high cash flow companies that the analyst identified are said to be capable of using stable prices to generate high cash flow. Cash flow is the actual money that is available to a firm for its operations and investor returns, and the bank's latest oil price forecast sits at $87 after a $2 raise in February 2024.\n\nWith the outlook of oil still rosy despite a slow Chinese recovery, we decided to look at the top oil stocks with the biggest upside. Some notable picks are Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD). 13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\nAn oil derrick in the North Sea, revealing the scope of the company's drilling operations.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the oil stocks with the highest upside, we ranked Goldman Sachs's top oil stock picks in 2022 and 2024 by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in 2023's December quarter. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund shareholders were chosen as the oil stocks with the highest upside. For the oil stocks from 2022, the share price performance from March 2022 is shared.\n\nFor these oil stocks with the largest upside, we used we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\n13. Magnolia Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:MGY)\n\nNumber of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25\n\nShare Price Performance Since March 2022: -4.22%\n\nMagnolia Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:MGY) is a small American oil exploration firm headquartered in Houston, Texas.

(NYSE:OVV) produces oil in several American states and Canadian provinces. While the stock was quick to recover most of its 2022 losses in the next couple of months, a sell off that took place in July 2023 after it announced a $250 million asset sale is yet to reverse itself.\n\nInsider Monkey scoured through 933 hedge fund holdings for last year's fourth quarter and found that 35 had invested in Ovintiv Inc.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best hot stocks to buy for March. If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Hot Stocks to Buy For March.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is dominated by one key theme. If you haven't been following us regularly, then you'd have missed out on the fact that artificial intelligence, powered by the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the key factor on investors' minds when they look at major indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech focused NASDAQ Composite. No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half.\n\nThis surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The two are worth $1.8 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively, while NVIDIA's 64% rise year to date fueled by the firm's latest earnings release means that its latest market capitalization now sits at $1.97 trillion with trailing and forward price to earnings ratios of 66 and 33, respectively.\n\nYet, even though NVIDIA's shares take off and have no signs of looking back, the broader macroeconomic trends that shaped the stock market discourse in 2022 and 2023 are nevertheless still in play. Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) merits a mention. Goldman was one of the few voices on Wall Street that bucked the trend in late 2022 and argued that avoiding a recession might be avoidable despite rapid central bank interest rate hikes. Now, the bank shares that during the week that ended on February 2023, hedge funds sold technology stocks at some of the highest rates for the past five years. It believes that software stocks were among the biggest losers, while bullish bets such as call options for NVIDIA's shares remain in play and suggest a hesitancy to completely go against technology stocks.\n\nSo, with Q1 2024 shaping up to be quite interesting, we decided to take a look at some hot stocks to buy. A couple of these are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). 12 Best Hot Stocks to Buy For March\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best hot stocks to buy for March, we ranked the 50 best performing stocks of the S&P 500 over the past 30 days by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end.

        "title": "Big banks are getting what they want from Washington",
        "content": "Big banks have been pressing US regulators to reconsider a controversial rule requiring them to hold greater buffers against future losses, and this week they got what they wanted.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jay Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg both said Thursday they anticipate changes to the rule following pushback from lenders, community groups, Republicans and even some Democrats.\n\nPowell told Senate lawmakers that \"I expect there will be material and broad changes,\" and \"we won\u2019t hesitate\" to re-propose the rule if that makes sense \u2014 repeating a point he made to House lawmakers Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate committee Thursday. REUTERS/Tom Brenner (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGruenberg told reporters separately that \"I certainly think we anticipate making changes in the final rule based on the extensive comments that we've received.\"\n\nThe concerns about the capital rule \u2014 the most aggressive change to how banks are regulated since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 range from harm it could do to the US economy to ways in which it would reduce access to mortgages for disadvantaged home buyers.\n\nThe willingness of regulators to change what they already proposed highlights the increased sway that big banks have in Washington, a sharp contrast to the harsh political scrutiny they received in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"We also see this as potentially marking an important inflection point whereby the regulatory burden levied on the largest banks\" after the 2008 crisis \"could be nearing a peak,\" Ebrahim Poonawala, a bank analyst for Bank of America, said in a note this week.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday accused Powell of flip-flopping on tougher capital rules after pledging last year to be more aggressive with supervision following the failures of several mid-sized lenders such as Silicon Valley Bank. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\n\"You have gone weak kneed on this,\" she told Powell during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.\n\nPowell said the capital rule \u2014 known as Basel 3 \u2014 is not directly related to what happened to Silicon Valley Bank and that the Fed is taking other steps to heighten supervision of specific banks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou will see I am doing exactly what I said I would do,\u201d Powell said.\n\nAt issue are higher capital requirements that were unveiled last summer by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr. Those requirements focused on the amount of capital that banks must have in reserve to protect themselves from insolvency.\n\nRegulators have said the proposal would result in a 16% increase in capital levels and a 20% increase in risk-weighted assets for big banks.\n\nIn the months since, the banks have launched a campaign to roll back the new rules \u2014 or scrap them entirely. Many banks submitted letters to the Fed listing the many problems they have with the rules ahead of a deadline for those comments that ended Tuesday.\n\nThe banks have contemplated suing if the rules don\u2019t get changed. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum openly discussed that possibility with reporters in January.\n\nSuing the bank\u2019s own regulator \"is never a preferred option,\" he said, but \"it can\u2019t be taken off the table.\"\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute, a trade group representing JPMorgan and other big banks, has reportedly hired a lawyer to prepare a lawsuit if the rules don\u2019t get changed, according to a report by Semafor.\n\nOne big bank lobbyist, Financial Services Forum President and CEO Kevin Fromer, said he was \"encouraged\" by Powell\u2019s assurances this week.\n\n\"We agree, broad and material changes are needed to the proposal to avoid significant harm to the economy, businesses of every size and American households,\" he said.\n\n\"To achieve that, we continue to believe that a re-proposal is the best approach to giving the public a well-justified and data-based rule that is consistent with the plans of other jurisdictions.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "In this article, we will list the 25 most indebted companies in the world in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion about interest rates and corporate debt, go to the 9 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2024.\n\nInterest rates are expected to go down this year, but the Federal Reserve recently indicated that it will be a while before that happens. The Fed President, Raphael Bostic recently highlighted that the risk of inflation may get stuck above the central bank's 2.1% target. He said that it will likely be appropriate for the Fed to approve two quarter-point rate cuts by the end of this year. Currently, interest rates in the United States are at a twenty-year high of 5.25%-5.50%.\n\nThe interest rates were increased as a response to rising prices post-Covid. By doing this, the Fed controls the money supply in the economy, thereby gaining some control over inflation. However, the high interest rates are bad news for corporate America.\n\nMany fast-growing companies prefer to use debt to support their higher growth rather than equity. Debt is arguably less expensive for these companies as the rate of growth of business equity value is often greater than the borrowing cost of debt. However, as the interest rates get higher, the gap between the borrowing cost and the rate of growth of equity becomes narrower. Many fast-growing companies also prefer debt because loans do not provide an ownership stake. It also prevents the dilution of the owner's equity position in the business.\n\nFast-growing companies, however, are not the only businesses that use debt. Many businesses use debt for their leverage. Debt provides a way to consistently build equity value for the shareholders. In addition, interest payments on loans are treated as expenses and deducted from revenue, thereby resulting in lower taxes.\n\nDespite all the benefits of debt, the most indebted companies in the world are financial institutions. We saw a similar trend in our companies with the most cash reserves article, where an overwhelming majority were financial institutions. These institutions, particularly banks, rely on borrowing money as their business model. The bank's spread (the difference between the rate at which it borrows and lends) is an essential tool for its profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the high-interest rates, there is still significant borrowing in the US. There seems to be an endless demand for top-rated corporate debt in the country, which has created an unease among some investors. There is also a concern that liquidity conditions could worsen this year, as so far this year, investment-grade US companies have raised a record amount of debt.\n\nAccording to S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) corporate debt defaults increased by 80% in 2023. There is a strong likelihood that defaults will remain high this year too. As per S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) the number of companies that failed to make required payments on their debt totaled 153 for 2023, up from 85 in 2022. In 2024, S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) expects further debt deterioration globally, predominantly at the lower end of the ranking scale.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 25 most indebted companies in the world in 2024.  25 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2024\n\nAn entrepreneur meeting with a financial advisor discussing venture debt opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the most indebted companies in the world in 2024, we looked at the latest debt figures on the balance sheet of companies. We used trusted sources for our research. Companies are ranked according to their debt, the higher their debt, the higher they rank on our list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "In this piece, we are going to shed light on the 20 Largest Banks in The World by Market Cap. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector, you can go directly to 5 Largest Banks in The World by Market Cap.\n\nThe global banking industry is on the rise, with a bright future ahead. Despite economic challenges like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the industry is set at $614.62 billion in 2023 and is expected to climb to a whopping $1,231.49 billion market size by 2027. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of digital banking, as more customers crave personalized and flexible services. Companies are also embracing cloud-native architecture to enhance their offerings. Oracle, for example, is leading the way with innovative cloud-native banking services. All in all, the industry is evolving to meet the changing needs of customers and is poised for continuous growth.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the global banking industry is in for some twists and turns. A slowdown in the global economy, along with a mix of economic uncertainties, will keep banks on their toes. While efforts to tackle inflation are showing progress in some places, other issues like supply chain disruptions, shifting trade dynamics, and geopolitical tensions are complicating matters. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects cautious global economic growth of around 3.0% in 2024, with advanced economies like the US, Euro area, Japan, UK, and Canada expected to see modest growth.\n\nOn the bright side, many emerging economies, fueled by strong consumer demand and favorable trade balances, are likely to outpace the pack. India, in particular, is poised for robust growth at 6.3%. However, China is facing some challenges with sluggish consumer demand and a shaky property market, which could have ripple effects globally. Efforts to boost confidence in China's economy could impact other Asian countries as well. Inflation is also a hot topic, with expectations of a decrease to 5.2% in 2024. Central banks will be busy adjusting their monetary policies to navigate these choppy waters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US Federal Reserve might tweak interest rates, while the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of England, and Bank of Canada are also expected to make moves in response to changing economic conditions. Overall, central banks are gearing up to manage global money supply more closely as we head towards 2024.

        "title": "12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best single digit stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our coverage of affordable stocks and how they, like all other stocks such as small cap and large cap stocks, benefit and suffer from the broader macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In.\n\nStocks can broadly be classified into three categories based on their market capitalization. Each of these represents firms whose shares operate with different dynamics within the broader market climate. The three primary stock categories are small, mid, and large caps, with the passage of time that has seen trillion dollar valuations the likes of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also created new categories commonly called mega cap stocks.\n\nSimilarly, the proliferation of computing products across the financial industry has made stock trading easier, leading to thousands of firms in categories such as micro and nano cap stocks. These stocks, which include firms whose shares trade in the single digits, are on the more 'affordable' end of the spectrum in literal terms. Single digit stocks are a small upgrade over the broader category of well known stocks that are called penny stocks. Typically, these stocks refer to firms whose shares trade below $5, and when we consider the general benefits and drawbacks of investing, single digit stocks, and penny stocks follow the same rules.\n\nBoth offer a higher potential for larger percentage returns via share price appreciation. Similarly, since penny stocks and single digit stocks belong to companies that receive little media coverage, the potential of scammers exploiting unwitting investors is high. This is because during the initial stage of a 'pump' during a typical scam, the shares of a single digit or penny stock appreciate much faster than the media can respond to determine if the performance is driven by underlying fundamentals or other legitimate tailwinds. Then, as more investors pile on, should the price drop, then most people end up losing their money.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, where there's risk there's a reward, and one key advantage that single digit stocks have over penny stocks is that since they also include firms whose shares trade between $5 and $10, the opportunities from profiting also increase with the growing comfort of a heftier share price. Additionally, another key benefit that is rather exclusive to single digit stocks is that they can often involve the shares of well established and sizeable foreign entities who also make their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) available for trading on American stock markets.\n\nThis trend is present predominantly in the banking sector, with foreign or ex-US banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG), Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG), and Banco Santander, S.A. (NYSE:SAN) being apt examples. Each of these is a major player in the financial systems of their countries, with a role similar to U.S. banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).\n\nTherefore, investing in single digit stocks offers a chance of stability as well as profit taking. Continuing with our example of single digit banking stocks, MUFJ's shares are up by a respectable 16% year to date, despite the fact that Japan's economy, like other developed peers such as the United Kingdom and Germany, is not performing well. Similarly, even though Britain is officially in recession territory, Lloyd's stock has shed just 6% over the past twelve months and had the shares not dropped in January, then just like the British economy, the stock would also be nearly flat in growth terms.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best single digit stocks, it's important to also keep in mind recent stock market and economic news. With NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s blockbuster earnings out of the way, investors will now focus on interest rates and U.S. GDP growth - both of which are quite interlinked. Starting with the latter, S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), ahead of its flagship S&P 500 crossing the coveted 5,000 point barrier and setting a new record, also upgraded its forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2024. The ratings agency now believes that the American economy will grow by 2.4% in 2024, for a significant upward revision over the previous estimate of 1.5%. As this would hint on its own, the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes also show that the central bank is worried about cutting rates too soon rather than too late.\n\nSo, with single digit stocks offering the promise of returns and stability, we decided to look at what stocks hedge funds are buying. Some notable picks are Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG). 12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\nA close up of hands counting a vast stack of money in a bank vault.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best single digit stocks to buy, we ranked the 60 most valuable single digit stocks in terms of market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of December 2023. Out of these, the single digit stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were chosen.\n\nFor these best single digit stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\n12. Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 32\n\nGarrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX) is an American car parts manufacturer that sells performance products like turbos for cars and air compressors for industrial use.

The largest Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)\u00a0 shareholder in our database is Howard Marks's Oaktree Capital Management courtesy of its $426 million stake.\n\nAlong with, Warner Bros.

(NASDAQ:MQ)'s top line to grow by 20%.\n\nBy the end of 2023's December quarter, 32 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Marqeta, Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ).

It's one of the more interesting stocks on our list of the best single digit stocks since while the shares soared after BGC Group, Inc.

        "title": "Wells Fargo slowly starts to shed the problems of its past",
        "content": "Wells Fargo's stock (WFC) is up 12% this year, outperforming all big bank rivals and within sight of an all-time high.\n\nOne big reason: Investors believe the San Francisco lending giant is slowly starting to shed some of the problems of its past.\n\nIt received a big boost last month when regulators with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency lifted a consent order tied to a 2016 fake accounts scandal.\n\nThe move was a victory for CEO Charles Scharf, who said when he took over the top job in 2019 that his \"first priority\" was to clean up the messes left by his predecessors. Charles Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo, testifies before a Senate committee last December. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nScharf is now looking to go on the offensive as he tries to make Wells Fargo into a major investment banking player, edging deeper into a hyper-competitive business where it lags behind Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nAnother push in that direction came this past week when Wells Fargo announced the hiring of M&A veteran Doug Braunstein, an executive Scharf knows from his days at JPMorgan when both Scharf and Braunstein were top lieutenants of Jamie Dimon in the tumultuous years following the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBraunstein knows what it's like to receive scrutiny from Washington. When he was CFO of JPMorgan during the \"London Whale\" trading debacle, he had to testify before Senate lawmakers in 2013. At Wells Fargo, Braunstein will report directly to the CEO as vice chairman.\n\n\"Doug is a world-class banker,\" Scharf said in a press release, noting that his \"expertise and business relationships reflect our continued commitment to strengthen\" Wells Fargo's Wall Street unit. Doug Braunstein, right, testified before a Senate committee in 2013 following sizable trading losses at JPMorgan, where he was CFO. REUTERS/Gary Cameron (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNot a 'light switch moment'\n\nThe CEO of the nation\u2019s fourth-largest bank is not out of the woods with regulators, however. Even though Scharf has ticked off six consent orders that regulators had in place when he became boss, Scharf still has eight to go \u2014 including two added during his tenure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big one is a cap on the size of Wells Fargo imposed by the Federal Reserve. It can\u2019t go past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017 unless regulators say so. The Fed imposed the broad restriction in 2018, citing \"widespread consumer abuses\" at Wells Fargo.\n\nLifting that cap would allow Wells Fargo to boost activity in its capital-intensive markets business, CFO Mike Santomassimo said last Monday at a UBS conference in Florida.\n\n\"I would just caution that when it does happen, it\u2019s not this kind of light switch moment,\" Santomassimo said, but \"we do believe that there'll be some opportunity there.\" At the moment, \"our focus is really to solve the risk and regulatory work first. ... We can't lose sight of that.\"\n\nSeveral analysts who follow the bank said Wells Fargo is taking steps in the right direction, and they do expect the Fed to eventually take the bank out of the penalty box.\n\n\"They\u2019ve done a tremendous amount under these highly idiosyncratic restrictions,\" said Scott Siefers, an analyst for Piper Sandler who has covered the bank over nearly two decades. \"To reach the company's full potential, they will certainly need more freedom over some period of time,\" he added.\n\nThe timing for when the Fed removes Wells Fargo's balance sheet limit remains \"hard to predict,\" according to Jefferies bank analyst Ken Usdin.\n\nEven after this asset cap is removed, a second third-party review is required to assess the bank's improvements.\n\nCross-selling\n\nThe irony of Wells Fargo\u2019s regulatory predicament is that there was a time not that long ago when it faced fewer constraints than its peers.\n\nIt was able to dodge many of the problems that hobbled other big banks during the 2008 financial crisis and became a coast-to-coast giant with its purchase that year of Wachovia, a big Charlotte lender weakened by a national mortgage meltdown.\n\nThe bank emerged from the crisis with a reputation for being conservative, not taking a lot of risks, and relying on a plain-vanilla, old-fashioned strategy of boosting revenue by cross-selling various products to existing customers.\n\nBut that strength turned into a weakness after it became clear in the second half of last decade that the bank had opened millions of bank and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge as employees raced to meet their sales goals.\n\nCEO John Stumpf, who had been with the bank for three decades, resigned and was later barred by regulators from the banking industry. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee in 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHis successor Tim Sloan left in 2019. He is now suing the bank in a California state court for $34 million, claiming the bank canceled stock grants and that Sloan was used as a \"scapegoat\" for the sales practices scandal.\n\nThe bank has said that it stands by its decisions and that \"compensation decisions are based on performance.\"\n\nThe search for a replacement landed Scharf, who had been in charge of JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank while working for Dimon and then became the CEO of credit card giant Visa (V) and custody bank Bank of New York Mellon (BK). Former Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan testifies before a House committee in 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n'A different company today'\n\nHis own overhaul has not been without surprises, including a $3.7 billion pact in December 2022 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to resolve allegations that it illegally overcharged customers on their auto loans and mortgages. The actions at issue took place as recently as 2022.\n\nScharf has also significantly reduced the bank\u2019s workforce. Since peaking during the pandemic in 2020 with 276,000 employees, Wells has eliminated roughly 18% of its headcount \u2014 or 50,000 employees. The bank\u2019s CFO said this past week that Wells Fargo may also trim more real estate as a cost-cutting move.\n\nThere was also a new reminder this past week that the sales-practice scandal is still not totally behind the bank.\n\nThe company was sued in a San Francisco federal court by customers claiming the lender was not doing enough to assist those who were harmed by being signed up for products they didn't want.\n\nThe bank sent out letters asking for people to contact Wells Fargo if they had been enrolled in such products, but the lawsuit claims the letter burdens the customer to take action.\n\nWells Fargo tries \"to avoid, reduce, and delay its ultimate liability and sweep under the rug its long-standing, intentional misconduct,\" lawyers representing the bank's customers stated.\n\nThe bank said it is still reviewing the legal claims. \"Wells Fargo is a different company today, with new people, structure, processes, controls, and culture in place, and we have placed heavy emphasis on remediating customers for past practices,\" a spokeswoman for the bank added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. (NYSE:GSBD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 29, 2024\n\nGoldman Sachs BDC, Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nAustin Neri: Good morning. This is Austin Neri, a member of the Investor Relations team for Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc., and I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that all participants will be in a listen-only mode until the end of the call when we will open up the line for questions. Before we begin today's call, I would like to remind our listeners that today's remarks may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the Company's control. The Company's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in the Company's SEC filings.\n\nThis audio cast is copyrighted material of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Yesterday, after the market close, the Company issued an earnings press release and posted a supplemental earnings presentation, both of which can be found on the homepage of our website at www.goldmansachsbdc.com under the Investor Resources section, and, which include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These documents should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K filed yesterday with the SEC. This conference call is being recorded today, Thursday, February 29, 2024, for replay purposes. I will now turn the call over to Alex Chi, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.\n\nStory continues A financial trader actively managing a portfolio of stocks on a high-definition LED touchscreen.\n\nAlex Chi: Thank you, Austin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and 2023 fiscal year-end earnings conference call. I'm here today with David Miller, our Co-Chief Executive Officer; Tucker Greene, our Chief Operating Officer; and Stan Matuszewski, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call by providing an update on the Goldman Sachs private credit platform before providing a brief overview of our fourth quarter results and then discuss the current market environment in more detail. I'll then turn the call over to David and Tucker to describe our portfolio activity and performance before handing it off to Stan, to take us through our financial results. And then finally, we'll open the line for Q&A.\n\nSo with that, I'd like to provide a brief update of the Goldman Sachs private credit platform and the positive impact on GSBD of being part of it. We are proud to announce that next week marks the second anniversary of our platform integration process. This endeavor brought all of Goldman Sachs' private credit origination and underwriting capabilities as well as various pools of capital with track records that stretch back over 28 years under a single roof within our asset management business. As you may recall, historically, our BDC complex, including GSBD, operated as a separate and distinct platform on the public side of the house that was walled off from the rest of the firm and could not take full advantage of being part of the Goldman Sachs ecosystem.\n\nIn these two short years, GSBD has been able to take advantage of the full origination capabilities of the broader private credit platform and its scale, enhance our infrastructure and improve upon our underwriting capabilities. I'd like to highlight a few examples. Amidst the volatile market and muted deal environment, the Goldman Sachs private credit platform remained active deploying $12 billion in 2023. The Direct Lending Americas platform comprised the majority of activity with over $6 billion deployed. Furthermore, taking advantage of the broader scale and origination capabilities, GSBD served as agent or lead lender and well above the majority of its new deals in 2023. Second, the team has spent the past two years actively upgrading GSBD's portfolio quality.\n\nSee also 30 Worst Countries for Women\u2019s Rights and 16 Best Mountain Towns for Retirement.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nOn February 28, 2024, Goldman Sachs BDC Inc (NYSE:GSBD) released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, along with its 8-K filing. GSBD, a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company, focuses on lending to middle-market companies to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. The company primarily invests in secured and unsecured debt and is managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. Goldman Sachs BDC Inc (GSBD) Reports Mixed Q4 Results; Declares $0.45 Dividend\n\nFinancial Performance and Portfolio Activity\n\nGSBD's investment portfolio saw a slight decrease in fair value, down to $3,414.3 million from $3,438.7 million in the previous quarter. Total debt outstanding also decreased to $1,832.2 million from $1,884.5 million. Despite a marginal increase in net assets, the company's net asset value per share remained relatively stable at $14.62.\n\nThe company's total investment income for Q4 decreased to $115.4 million, primarily due to lower repayments and accretion of discounted positions. Net investment income after taxes also saw a decrease, falling to $61.8 million from $72.9 million in the previous quarter. Adjusted net investment income after taxes, which excludes purchase discount amortization, was $60.7 million, down from $69.7 million in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nGSBD's net realized and unrealized losses improved, with adjusted net losses of $(10.1) million compared to $(18.1) million in the third quarter. The company's investment activity during the quarter included $166.2 million in new investment commitments across fourteen new and four existing portfolio companies, while sales and repayments totaled $224.0 million, driven by full repayments and exits from seven portfolio companies.\n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Portfolio Health\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, GSBD had $1,832.2 million in total debt outstanding with a combined weighted average interest rate of 5.45% for the quarter. The company's liquidity position included $724.1 million of availability under its Revolving Credit Facility and $52.4 million in cash. The ending net debt to equity leverage ratio improved slightly to 1.11x.\n\nThe health of GSBD's investment portfolio is reflected in the 99.9% of performing debt bearing a floating rate and a weighted average yield on debt and income-producing investments at fair value of 13.8%. However, investments on non-accrual status represented 2.3% of the total investment portfolio at fair value, indicating some areas of concern.\n\nOutlook and Conference Call\n\nGSBD will host an earnings conference call to discuss the quarterly results and provide further insights into the company's performance and strategies. Investors and interested parties are encouraged to participate or access the archived replay on the company's website.\n\nGoldman Sachs BDC Inc's latest earnings report presents a mixed picture, with stable net asset value and maintained dividends but decreased investment income and net investment income.

        "content": "Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.55 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.57 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.65 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.51%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this specialty finance company would post earnings of $0.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of 12.28%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nGoldman Sachs BDC , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry industry, posted revenues of $115.4 million for the quarter ended December 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $106.5 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nGoldman Sachs BDC shares have added about 6.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Goldman Sachs BDC?\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs BDC has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Goldman Sachs BDC: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.57 on $117.07 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.22 on $461.97 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - SBIC & Commercial Industry is currently in the bottom 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Fidus Investment (FDUS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 29.\n\nThis closed-end investment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFidus Investment's revenues are expected to be $32.83 million, up 19.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) closed the most recent trading day at $393.18, moving +0.61% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.17%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.06%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.55%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the investment bank had gained 1.02% over the past month, lagging the Finance sector's gain of 2.86% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.98% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Goldman Sachs in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Goldman Sachs to post earnings of $8.62 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.93%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $13.05 billion, showing a 6.75% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $32.66 per share and a revenue of $50.49 billion, signifying shifts of +42.81% and +9.16%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.43% increase. Goldman Sachs presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the context of valuation, Goldman Sachs is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 11.97. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 16.9 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that GS currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.37. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. Financial - Investment Bank stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.13 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 40, putting it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The gradual exit would help prevent drastic selloffs, the people said.\n\nThe guidance curbs the popular trade that helped quant funds boost returns in a tough market in 2023, but also exacerbated the stock rout in China this year that has forced regulators to step in to boost markets. Such products stood at as much as 200 billion yuan ($27.8 billion) at the start of the year, according to estimates by hedge fund Shanghai Banxia Investment Management Center.\n\nThe guidance was given over the past few days and may change, said the people.\n\nThe CSRC didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nQuants that use DMA for proprietary trades can continue with the strategy, though their leverage will be capped at one time the investment, the people said.

        "content": "Mergers and acquisitions are seeing a resurgence so far in 2024, but some of the top bankers on Wall Street are being careful not to overhype the dealmaking revival.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said Tuesday at a UBS financial services conference that \"it's gotten better\" compared with \"super anemic\" activity during parts of 2022 and 2023.\n\nHowever, Solomon does not expect investment banking to climb back to historical averages over the last decade. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum also poured some cold water on dealmaking expectations, acknowledging \"some momentum\" while also citing headwinds from lingering geopolitical uncertainty and aggressive antitrust scrutiny from Washington.\n\n\"Not the most conducive\" M&A environment, he said at the same UBS financial services conference in Key Biscayne, Fla.\n\nBig banks have been waiting two years for M&A to pick back up again. Last year was supposed to be the year things turned around; instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nA lot is riding on a Wall Street revival that sticks in 2024. That's because banks expect to see their traditional lending income drop as demand falls and margins get squeezed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates at some point this year, and that could hurt the giant banks that were able to charge a lot more for their loans when rates were higher.\n\nDeals are picking up significantly compared to this time last year, according to data provider Dealogic. The volume of US mergers is up 134% so far this quarter as of Tuesday morning compared to the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat surge includes a string of major deals announced in the US, including three last week amounting to $53 billion. The headliner was credit card lender Capital One (COF) saying it would acquire rival Discover Financial Services (DFS) for roughly $35 billion. Capital One headquarters in McLean, Va. (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\n\nThese pacts could mean hundreds of millions in new fees for some of the biggest banks. Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC), and Citigroup (C) all had a hand in at least one of the transactions.\n\nNo firm stands to benefit more from a revival more than Goldman. Profits were down 24% in 2023 due to the dealmaking slowdown and costs associated with the company's high-profile exit from consumer lending.\n\nIts full-year net income of $8.52 billion was the worst mark for Goldman since 2019, Solomon's first full year in charge. The firm did, however, post a sizable gain in the fourth quarter as equities trading and wealth management rose.\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman\u2019s board of directors awarded Solomon a 24% pay increase despite the challenging year. Solomon took home $31 million.\n\n\"I think we're gonna see a better operating environment for our core business. That doesn't mean every quarter, every minute, but I I think we've seen it already,\" said Solomon.\n\n\"I feel great about the way that the firm\u2019s positioned. I feel great about our client franchise and I think we're going to continue to deliver good returns for shareholders,\" he added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

The companies will jointly invest $1 billion in private credit deals in multiple Asia-Pacific markets with a particular focus on India.\n\nThe funds will be deployed through a separately managed account, which will be managed by GS through its dedicated on-ground team in Asia and a global private credit team.\n\nA number of financial institutions have been making efforts to enter into the $1.7 trillion global private credit market, given attractive opportunities and high demand in the space. Mubadala has been investing in private debt opportunities since 2009, mostly in the North America and Europe markets, but it has been recently focusing attention toward the Asia market.\n\nOmar Eraiqat, the co-head of the credit investment unit at Mubadala stated, \"The diverse and rapidly growing economies, as well as the increasing private-equity deal volumes, are significantly driving demand in Asia Pacific for customized credit solutions from non-traditional lenders.\"\n\nFurther, Greg Olafson, global head of private credit at Goldman said, \"The opportunity in private credit in Asia-Pacific is expansive.\"\n\nPer Preqin\u2019s data, private credit market in the region has grown 3.5 times in the last 10 years. Notably, in 2022, the market size in the region reached $81.3 billion and is further expected to touch $100 billion by 2027.\n\nThe partnership is similar to the one Goldman made with Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System in September 2023 to co-invest in private credit transactions in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe expansion into the private credit space will likely drive Goldman\u2019s revenue growth amid efforts to scale back its consumer banking business and focusing on its core strengths of investment banking, trading and asset management.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman\u2019s shares have gained 20% in the past six months compared with the\u00a0industry\u2019s growth of 12%.

Meanwhile, companies are increasingly turning to this fundraising channel amid scaled-back bank lending and the need for flexible financing solutions.\n\n\"The diverse and rapidly growing economies, as well as the increasing private equity deal volumes, are significantly driving demand in Asia-Pacific for customised credit solutions from non-traditional lenders,\" said Omar Eraiqat, deputy CEO of diversified investments at Mubadala.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This partnership with Goldman Sachs complements our aspirations to grow our private credit exposure in [Asia-Pacific], a region that is central to Mubadala's strategic growth initiatives.\"\n\nMubadala has a US$276 billion portfolio that spans six continents, with interests in multiple sectors and asset classes as it continues to diversify the economy of the United Arab Emirates following its government's lead. As a result, China has been a focal point amid its warming ties with the Middle East.\n\nWith an eye on such opportunities, international banks too are expanding in the Middle East and North Africa region. Last year, Goldman opened an office in Abu Dhabi Global Market, the international financial centre of the UAE's capital.\n\nGoldman will manage the latest US$1 billion partnership via on-the-ground teams in Asia and a global private credit team comprising 165 credit investment professionals and US$110 billion in assets under management.\n\nIt follows a similar pact Goldman struck with the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System last September to invest in Asian private credit.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The cartel and its allies including Russia are widely expected to prolong their current cutbacks into the next quarter at their meeting early next month.\n\n\u201cWe still expect OPEC+ to extend cuts through the second quarter of 2024, and to only gradually and partially phase out the latest package starting in the third quarter,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Daan Struyven said in a note.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has clinched $1 billion from Mubadala Investment Co. to scour for more private credit deals in Asia.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBYD Unveils $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Zelenskiy Says 31,000 Troops Killed as Ukraine Seeks US Aid Decision Within Month Norwegian Cruise Ship Halted at Mauritius Due to Outbreak Buffett Says \u2018Eye-Popping\u2019 Results Unlikely With Record Cash Risk Models Behind World\u2019s Best Hedge Fund Strategy Are Getting a Lot Harder to Crack\n\nThe Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund and Goldman\u2019s asset-management arm struck a partnership to invest alongside each other in the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on India. The pact follows a similar mandate the New York-based firm received from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System in September.\n\n\u201cSome of the investors might be underpenetrated across private credit in general and they are looking at getting more exposure across this asset class,\u201d James Reynolds, the head of direct lending at Goldman\u2019s money management unit, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s where partnering with these powerful institutions creates a win-win.\u201d\n\nThe $1.7 trillion private credit market has more than doubled in size over the past five years as investors flocked to the asset class seeking higher returns. It\u2019s quickly established itself as a permanent investment bucket for pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds and become a major source of funding for companies and private equity firms.\n\nRead more: Why Is Private Credit Booming? How Long Can It Last?: QuickTake\n\nFor years, investors across the Middle East showed little interest in private debt: the asset class offered yields that were too low for their return targets. Yet higher interest rates and the market\u2019s overall growth have recently led to a shift in sentiment.\n\nInstitutions like Mubadala and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority have struck partnerships to strengthen their presence in the market and managers including Blue Owl Capital Inc. and Hayfin Capital Management have expanded their presence in the region to drum up business.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile North America and Europe have gotten crowded with dozens of private credit firms looking to lend money directly to companies \u2014 mostly in the context of leveraged buyouts \u2014 the market is significantly less developed in Asia Pacific. Goldman is among the few private credit titans making a big push into the region. Som Krishna helps run the asset management unit\u2019s credit business in Asia.\n\n\u201cWhat these markets need is a blossoming, growing private equity industry,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe want to partner up with investors who want to have Asia exposure and they want to go with a platform that has experience and track record.\u201d\n\nRead more: Blue Owl Eyes More Middle East Money With Plans for New Office\n\nPrivate credit tie-ups have been on an upswing in the Middle East over the past year.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 easiest and best paying jobs of 2024. We have also discussed the industrial and sectoral growth in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Easiest and Best Paying Jobs of 2024.\n\nIn January 2024, the US job market exceeded expectations, adding 353,000 jobs, maintaining a strong labor market with an unemployment rate of 3.7%. This marked the continuation of a trend, as revisions showed that the previous year's job growth was even stronger than initially reported, totaling 3.1 million new jobs. Economists were surprised by the resilience of the labor market despite aggressive interest rate increases, attributing it to factors such as rising consumer sentiment and easing inflation.\n\nThe unexpected job growth in January mirrors the strength seen in gross domestic product measurements for the fourth quarter of 2023, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's patient approach to interest rates. While January's gains were broad-based, particularly in professional and business services and healthcare, analysts cautioned against overinterpretation due to potential survey anomalies and temporary factors like weather disruptions.\n\nDespite some sectors experiencing growth slowdowns, the overall outlook for the US economy remains positive, with strong wage growth, high consumer confidence, and a tight labor market persisting. However, uncertainties persist, including potential short-lived surges in job creation and fluctuations in specific industries. Nonetheless, the economy's resilience and the continuation of positive trends suggest a promising start to the year for American workers and businesses alike.\n\nJob openings in various industries have seen major shifts as some are experiencing a decline, relieving the pressures of labor shortages, while others continue to grapple with the challenge. The easing of worker scarcity coincides with the gradual abatement of the pandemic, marking a turning point in the employment landscape. Sectors like retail have witnessed a complete elimination of labor shortages, while industries such as healthcare persistently struggle to fill vacancies, exemplifying the divergent trajectories across different sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also interesting to note that measuring the tightness of the labor market involves various indicators, including the share of unfilled job openings and the number of unemployed workers per opening. For instance, in industries like financial activities and government, the share of unfilled job openings ranges from 32.5% to 63.5%, with minimal unemployed workers per opening, hovering around 0.2 to 0.39. Meanwhile, sectors like construction and retail exhibit different figures, with negative shares of unfilled openings indicating more hires than vacancies and higher ratios of unemployed workers per opening, indicating looser market conditions. To read more about industries hiring, see Top Industries That Are Hiring Right Now.\n\nAs manufacturing is one of the prime industries in the US which is also currently hiring, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is partnering with Jacksonville Job Corps to address a manufacturing shortage, investing $200,000 in a training center at the campus.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 30 highest paying jobs in the world in the future. We have also discussed the future of jobs and some prominent trends. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paying Jobs In The World In The Future.\n\nThe future of jobs is intricately intertwined with technological developments, demographic changes, and global economic dynamics. Forecasts suggest that automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) will largely alter the outlook of employment. By 2030, these technologies could redefine job roles, with projections indicating that up to 800 million jobs could be automated globally. Moreover, studies show that a large portion of tasks \u2014 up to 30% \u2014could be automated, potentially leading to a prodigious job displacement. To read about AI-proof jobs, see 20 Jobs Artificial Intelligence Can\u2019t Replace.\n\nIn addition, the shift in global economic power will influence job markets worldwide. Emerging and developing countries with a strong focus on innovation and education may gain significant advantages, while developed countries can face challenges such as wealth disparity and job losses due to automation. By 2030, it is estimated that demand for energy and water will increase by as much as 50% and 40% respectively, indicating a sizable need for workforce adaptation in sectors addressing these needs.\n\nBetween these transformations, the role of digital platforms and AI will be crucial. Studies show that 73% of respondents believe that technology can never replace the human mind. However, concerns regarding data privacy, cyber threats, and job displacement persist. While some envision a future where AI augments human capabilities, others worry about its implications for job security. Regardless, embracing digitalization and leveraging AI responsibly will be essential for navigating the future job market. Ultimately, how societies adapt to these changes will determine the trajectory of the workforce in 2030 and beyond.

In 2023, millions of sustainability jobs awaited skilled workers, yet many lacked necessary qualifications, particularly women. Only 1 in 8 globally possessed requisite green skills such as carbon measurement or renewable energy project development. LinkedIn data revealed a 29% higher green hiring rate in 2023, indicating promising job prospects. However, the gender gap persists, with 9 in 10 women lacking green skills or experience. Encouragingly, women are joining the green talent pool at a higher rate, though not rapidly enough to close the disparity.\u00a0 To read more about green jobs, see the Fastest Growing Green Jobs in the World.\n\nTo shed light upon the growing influence and spead of AI, it is interesting to note that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has recently made an agreement with Reddit, valued at $60 million, to utilize the diverse content of the social media platform for training its AI models.\n\nThis collaboration has sparked a range of reactions, with some expressing concern over the potential consequences of exposing AI to Reddit's often unconventional and extreme content. Instances of peculiar narratives and contentious discussions on the platform have raised doubts about the wisdom of this partnership, as critics fear the AI may adopt problematic behaviors or viewpoints.\n\nHowever, between this apprehension, it's essential to acknowledge Reddit's positive contributions, offering valuable insights and uplifting narratives alongside its more controversial content. This deal highlights a broader trend in the tech industry, where major players seek to leverage social media data to bolster AI capabilities. 30 Highest Paying Jobs In The World In The Future\n\nAn overview of a commodities exchange room where traders buy and sell futures contracts, physical commodities, and Treasury Bills.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the highest paying jobs in the world in the future, we first identified by 50 fastest growing jobs in the future between 2023 and 2027 as highlighted by the Future of Work 2023 Report by the World Economic Fortum.

        "title": "Decoding The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Insight into the robust market positioning and diversified revenue streams of GS. Analysis of competitive pressures and regulatory challenges facing the firm. Exploration of GS's strategic initiatives for sustainable growth and financial opportunity. Assessment of potential risks from market volatility and legal landscapes.\n\nOn February 23, 2024, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) filed its annual 10-K report with the SEC, offering a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic direction. As a leading global financial institution, GS operates through three main business segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management, and Platform Solutions. The firm's financial performance reflects a balanced revenue mix, with approximately 20% from investment banking, 45% from trading, 20% from asset management, and 15% from wealth management and retail financial services. Geographically, GS generates around 60% of its net revenue from the Americas, 15% from Asia, and 25% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. With an aggregate market value of common stock held by non-affiliates at approximately $106.2 billion as of June 30, 2023, and 325.56 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 9, 2024, GS's financial standing remains robust. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest SEC filing, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of GS's strategic position.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS. Decoding The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nGlobal Presence and Diversified Services: The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) boasts a formidable global footprint, with significant operations across the Americas, Asia, and EMEA. This geographical diversity not only mitigates the risks associated with market-specific downturns but also allows GS to tap into growth opportunities across different economies. The firm's diversified service offerings, spanning from investment banking to asset management, provide multiple revenue streams, which is a testament to its resilience against economic fluctuations. In 2023, GS's Global Banking & Markets segment continued to foster long-term relationships with institutional clients, reinforcing its market-making capabilities and advisory services. The Asset & Wealth Management segment managed a wide range of assets, offering investment products to both institutional and individual clients, further solidifying GS's position as a comprehensive financial services provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnological Innovation and Client Connectivity: GS's commitment to technological innovation is a significant strength, as evidenced by its investment in platforms like Marquee, which offers institutional investors market intelligence, risk analytics, and trade execution. This focus on technology enhances client connectivity and provides a competitive edge by streamlining operations and improving the client experience. Moreover, the firm's Global Investment Research business maintains a strong research foundation, covering approximately 3,000 companies and 50 national economies, which underpins its advisory and market-making activities with data-driven insights.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Burdens: As a systemically important financial institution, GS faces extensive regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions. Compliance with evolving regulations requires significant resources and can impact profitability. The firm's 10-K filing acknowledges the challenges of adhering to complex laws and regulations, which necessitate interpretive decisions that could affect business operations and the ability to meet regulatory requirements such as capital or liquidity mandates. The need for ongoing investment in compliance infrastructure and personnel could potentially constrain GS's operational flexibility and financial performance.\n\nCompetitive and Pricing Pressures: The financial services industry is characterized by intense competition, and GS is not immune to the pressures that come with it. The firm competes with a broad range of financial institutions, from large global banks to specialized boutique firms. As highlighted in the filing, competitors may offer more favorable transaction execution, innovative products, or better client experiences. Additionally, the trend toward electronic and low-commission trading has led to pricing pressures, particularly in market-making and asset management services, which could erode profit margins if not effectively managed.\n\nOpportunities\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Market Expansion: GS has the opportunity to expand its market share and enhance its service offerings through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. The firm's recent initiatives, such as One Million Black Women and 10,000 Small Businesses, demonstrate its commitment to inclusive growth and community engagement. These programs not only contribute to societal development but also open new avenues for business expansion. Furthermore, GS's Platform Solutions segment, which includes consumer platforms and transaction banking, presents opportunities for growth in the digital banking and fintech sectors, areas that are witnessing rapid innovation and customer adoption.\n\nAdaptation to Industry Trends: The financial industry is undergoing significant transformation, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. GS's ability to adapt to these trends, such as the increasing demand for sustainable and impact investing, positions the firm to capture emerging market opportunities. The firm's sustainability strategy, which emphasizes diversity and inclusion, aligns with broader societal shifts and can attract clients who prioritize corporate responsibility in their investment decisions.\n\nThreats\n\nMarket Volatility and Economic Uncertainty: GS operates in an environment where market volatility and economic uncertainty can significantly impact its business segments. Fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices can affect the firm's trading and investment banking activities. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and recessionary risks, pose threats to GS's global operations and financial stability.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks: The 10-K filing underscores the legal and regulatory risks that GS faces, including potential fines, sanctions, and restrictions on business activities. Changes in laws or regulations, particularly those that disproportionately affect financial institutions, could adversely impact GS's competitive position and profitability. Moreover, the firm must navigate the complexities of operating in multiple regulatory regimes,\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Goldman Sachs Group's shares on or after the 28th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$2.75 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$11.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Goldman Sachs Group has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current stock price of US$390.47. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Goldman Sachs Group can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nView our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Goldman Sachs Group paid out a comfortable 45% of its profit last year.\n\nGenerally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nWhen earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely.

So we're not too excited that Goldman Sachs Group's earnings are down 2.7% a year over the past five years.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Goldman Sachs Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 19% a year on average.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Goldman Sachs Group? Goldman Sachs Group's earnings per share are down over the past five years, although it has the cushion of a low payout ratio, which would suggest a cut to the dividend is relatively unlikely. It doesn't appear an outstanding opportunity, but could be worth a closer look.\n\nWith that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with Goldman Sachs Group, you should know about the other risks facing this business. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group you should know about.\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

        "content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' analysts no longer expect a U.S. interest rate cut in May and see four 25 basis point cuts this year, as policymakers' rhetoric suggests they are in no rush.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on Thursday he needed to see a few more months of inflation data to check the economy was on track toward price stability.\n\n\"Because there are only two rounds of inflation data and a little over two months until the May (Fed) meeting, his comments suggest to us that a rate cut as early as May, which we had previously expected, is unlikely,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.

        "content": "In this piece, we will be presenting 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate. If you want to skip detailed analysis of Wealth Management Market, you can go directly to 5 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate.\n\nIn a cultural landscape where homeownership is often portrayed as the epitome of financial achievement, the pervasive belief in the \"American Dream\" can overshadow alternative avenues to building wealth. While investing in real estate is commonly touted as one of the surefire ways to secure a prosperous future, it is imperative to recognize that it may not be the optimal strategy for everyone. This article delves into the intricacies of 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate. While property ownership undeniably has its merits, a diverse array of wealth-building options exists beyond the realms of bricks and mortar.\n\nThe global wealth management market expanded from $1,681.75 billion in 2022 to $1,826.17 billion in 2023, demonstrating a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.6%. Furthermore, the wealth management market is expected to grow to $2465.75 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 7.8%. The global landscape of wealth management is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by an escalating demand for alternative investments. The surge in interest towards private equity, commodities, hedge funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and intellectual property is reshaping the dynamics of the wealth management market.\n\nBefore delving into Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate, it's crucial to recognize prominent players in the wealth management industry. Three notable companies in this sector are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM); understanding their roles and market positions provides valuable insights into the broader landscape of wealth management.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) provides investment banking financial services, catering to diverse financial planning needs of the clients. Also, clients can access various discretionary options for investment management, benefitting from Morgan Stanley's global resources and expertise.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley had revenue of $54.00 billion in the twelve months ending September 30, 2023, down -2.61% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2023 was $13.27 billion with 2.21% year-over-year growth.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Intriguingly, a 2019 report by Wealth-X sheds light on a fascinating aspect of wealth creation, challenging the conventional notion that substantial riches are primarily inherited. The report, which defines the ultra-wealthy as individuals possessing $30 million or more in assets, unveils a surprising statistic\u201467.7% of the world's ultra-wealthy are self-made. This revelation not only debunks the myth that significant wealth is predominantly a product of inheritance but also underscores the potential for individuals to amass fortunes from humble beginnings.\n\nWhat adds another layer of fascination to this narrative is the rapid ascent of the self-made ultra-wealthy. Between the 2019 and 2020 reports, the number of ultra-wealthy individuals surged from 265,490 to 290,720, marking an astonishing nearly 10% increase. This surge indicates a dynamic shift in the landscape of wealth creation, suggesting that achieving the seemingly \"impossible\" is not only possible but is becoming more commonplace. As we delve into the intricacies of building wealth without relying on real estate, these statistics serve as a compelling backdrop, emphasizing the evolving opportunities for individuals to forge their paths to financial success.\n\nIt is intriguing to note the varying perspectives on wealth among different generations. While only 41% of Americans believe they will ever achieve wealth, there is a notable divergence between age groups. Younger individuals, with nearly 70% of Gen Z and 54% of millennials expressing optimism about future wealth accumulation, demonstrate a more hopeful outlook. Furthermore, the younger generations exhibit a greater faith in the stock market, with 38% of Gen Z and 37% of millennials viewing it as the best route to wealth, compared to 30% of Gen X and 24% of baby boomers.\n\nWhile real estate has maintained its status as a traditional route to prosperity, this article contends that it is by no means the only viable option. By exploring alternative methods, readers will discover that building wealth and breaking free from the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle can be achieved without necessarily investing in property. The importance of dispelling the notion that saving alone leads to wealth cannot be overstated. With inflation rates exceeding 8%, keeping money dormant in a bank account results in a significant loss of value over time. The argument here is not against savings, but rather an encouragement to embrace a more dynamic and growth-oriented financial strategy. 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate\n\nAn executive in a luxury office, speaking on a conference call about wealth management investments.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo come up with our list of 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate, we conducted an extensive research, relying on experts\u2019 opinion, running around on various sources, to finalize our list. The sources used are namely, Sarwa, CNBC, Forbes, Finance Buzz, and Business Insider. With his, let us now look now head on to our list of 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Switch Jobs\n\nStrategic job changes can be a powerful wealth-building move. In 2022, over 22% of workers aged 20+ changed jobs in under a year. Job hoppers beat inflation in 49% of cases, compared to 42% who stayed put. As skills and experience grow, so does market value, allowing for higher salary negotiations. Beyond immediate pay bumps, job hopping fosters long-term wealth by enabling skill development and expanding professional networks. Overall, it's a way to maximize earning potential and secure financial growth.\n\n14. Invest in your Education\n\nInvesting in education is a powerful wealth-building strategy. By focusing on personal development and continuous learning, individuals can unlock better job opportunities, promotions, and high-income careers. This doesn't always require a large financial investment; resources like reading, online courses, and mentorship offer cost-effective paths to growth. Moreover, education fosters resilience, innovation, and financial literacy, empowering individuals to navigate economic challenges and optimize wealth accumulation over time.\n\n13. Do not carry Credit Card Debt\n\nAvoiding credit card debt is crucial for wealth-building. Paying off your balances in full each month prevents high-interest charges, saving money and preserving a healthy credit score. This ensures access to better financial products and interest rates when necessary.\n\n12. Have enough Insurance\n\nInsurance is a vital component of any budget, safeguarding you from substantial financial losses in unfortunate events. Health insurance is essential to avoid crippling expenses from medical issues. Homeowner and auto insurance protect your property and vehicles. Additionally, term life insurance provides financial security for dependents. While building wealth is important, protecting it from unforeseen circumstances is equally crucial. Proactively insuring your most valuable assets ensures financial stability. As Jack Ma, a renowned Chinese business investor, wisely stated, \"Buying insurance cannot change your life but it prevents your life from being changed.\"\n\n11. Tackle your Debt\n\nMaterial wealth doesn't guarantee a positive net worth; having $1 million in the stock market doesn't offset $1 million in debt, resulting in a net worth of zero. Accumulating substantial debt is a major obstacle to financial prosperity. Paying off debt not only builds wealth but also reduces stress and enhances peace of mind. While some debt can be beneficial if used wisely, minimizing debt and financial burdens is advisable. Ultimately, carrying as little debt as possible is key to financial stability and wealth accumulation, according to most financial advisors.\n\n10. Peer-to-Peer Lending\n\nPeer-to-peer lending, or P2P lending, facilitates borrowing money from individuals or businesses via online platforms that connect borrowers with lenders. Lenders earn money through interest charged on the loans they provide. Interest rates on P2P loans vary based on borrower risk, loan term, and other factors, typically exceeding rates offered by traditional savings accounts or investments. P2P lending platforms offer annual returns ranging from 4% to 15%, contingent on the platform and specific loan.\n\n9. Put Your Money in 401(k)s and IRAs\n\nAn Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a personal retirement account, whereas a 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. With a 401(k), a portion of your paycheck is automatically deposited into the account, often with an employer match. Conversely, with an IRA, contributions are made by the individual, with no employer involvement. Personal finance expert, Jean Chatzky, highlighted that the automated nature of 401(k)s, simplifies contributions compared to IRA contributions, which require active decisions. Once contributions begin, the focus should be on long-term growth through strategic investments.\n\n8. Open a Taxable Investment Account\n\nOnce you've maximized contributions to your IRA and 401(k) accounts, the next step is to open a taxable investment account, also known as a brokerage account. Allocate a predetermined amount to this account annually. Experts from Business Insider recommend allocating 25% of your gross income each year to a combination of retirement and brokerage accounts for wealth management clients. This diversified approach ensures that you continue building wealth beyond retirement savings, while maximizing investment opportunities and potential returns.\n\n7. Explore Passive Income Ideas\n\nDiversifying your income beyond your main job or business is crucial for building wealth from scratch. Passive income, which doesn't require constant labor, offers financial freedom beyond typical employment. Warren Buffett's famous advice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die,\u201d underscores the importance of earning even when you're not actively working. In today's digital economy, there are various avenues for passive income, such as affiliate marketing, drop shipping, and selling digital products.\n\n6. Invest in Commodities\n\nCommodity trading predates stocks and bonds and now takes place on specialized stock marketplaces known as commodity exchanges. Today, millions of individuals invest in commodities daily. One of the primary benefits of commodity investments is their ability to hedge against inflation.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best Dow Jones dividend stocks according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the Dow and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nInvestors have employed various dividend strategies over time to enhance their returns. Looking back at history, it's evident that dividend-paying stocks have often outperformed other types of investments. Opting for dividend stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can be particularly advantageous. This index comprises numerous dividend-paying stocks, notably blue-chip companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases. In 2023, the DJIA saw a significant increase of 14%, with 19 component stocks experiencing gains while 11 component stocks faced declines over the course of the year. Towards the end of the year, in December, the index reached a record-breaking high, surpassing the $37,000 mark.\n\nApart from delivering robust returns over the years, dividends have also maintained their significance as a growing component of personal income. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the proportion of personal income attributed to dividend earnings has consistently risen over time, underscoring their importance as a source of income. In 2012, dividend income accounted for 5.64% of per capita personal income in the U.S., compared to 4.39% in the previous decade and 3.51% two decades prior. Conversely, during this same period, interest income from capital markets has steadily declined, dropping to 7.39% in 2012 from 13.51% in 1992. According to the report, the total dividend income, adjusted for inflation to $2000, experienced a substantial rise from $187.6 billion in 1992 to $757 billion in 2012, marking an impressive growth of over 300%. In contrast, interest income grew by less than 100% over the same period.\n\nWhen investors consider dividend stocks for their portfolios, they often prioritize dividend yields. However, it's important to note that companies offering high yields but lacking solid financial stability could face the risk of reducing dividends, especially amidst global economic uncertainties and increasing interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies aimed at high yields should also prioritize the quality and stability of the companies in question. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks within each covered market, chosen for their consistent dividend payments and strong fundamental strength. When utilizing any income strategy, market participants typically prioritize both yield and capital gain. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their respective benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, for the period spanning from June 30, 2001, to June 30, 2023, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which assumes theoretical reinvestment of dividends, averaged 11.7% annually. This performance outpaced its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which achieved a 10.2% return over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon Communications Inc.

        "title": "How KKR Helped JPMorgan Seal a Key Victory Over Private Credit",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A roughly $5 billion debt deal for the buyout of health-care tech company Cotiviti Inc. was poised to become the largest such financing ever provided by private credit firms when first contemplated last year. It now ranks as one of traditional Wall Street\u2019s biggest triumphs against direct lenders.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales Biden Touts $1.2 Billion in Student Loan Relief With Eye to 2024 China Tightens Grip on Stocks With Net Sale Ban at Open, Close She Was Set to Break Goldman\u2019s Glass Ceiling. Now Beth Hammack Is Leaving Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade\n\nThe about-turn in the closely watched financing is the result of a tie-up between private equity firms KKR & Co. and Veritas Capital \u2014 which will jointly own Cotiviti \u2014 and their bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nKKR and Veritas relied on their own capital markets teams to do much of the work that\u2019s typically carried out by banks for debt offerings of this size. Yet with the support of the banks the group was able to double the amount of investors participating in the deal, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction. Pricing improved from the level originally targeted and was far more favorable compared to what private credit funds had offered.\n\nThe deal is the latest example of how the lines are blurring between the roles of private equity firms, private credit lenders and the big Wall Street investment banks that used to be the gatekeepers to debt capital markets.\n\nMultibillion-dollar buyout financings that once required banks to act as intermediaries between a borrower and investors can now be provided by a small group of private lenders or even syndicated by private equity firms directly to debt buyers. While KKR also has a large private credit lending operation, the firm doesn\u2019t lend to companies owned by its private equity funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRepresentatives for KKR, Veritas, Cotiviti, JPMorgan and Goldman declined to comment.\n\nBy the time JPMorgan and Goldman signed financing documents around 3 a.m. in New York on Feb. 14, KKR and Veritas had already lined up more than enough buyers for the debt at a margin of around 3.5 to 4 percentage points over the US benchmark, according to the people. And that was before the deal obtained a higher credit rating, they said.\n\nJPMorgan and Goldman officially launched the debt sale later on Feb. 14, hours after KKR announced it had signed an agreement to acquire a 50% stake in Cotiviti from Veritas. Such a fast timeline is unheard of in the leveraged finance market, where banks typically hold debt commitments for months before replacing them with loans or bonds sold to investors.\n\nThe banks, which had received inquiries from investors in the run-up to the deal, helped tighten the pricing further to 3.25 percentage points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate \u2014 well below the levels private credit funds had discussed last year. Final pricing details are expected Thursday.\n\nIn House\n\nIt helped that investors were already familiar with Cotiviti. The company has been a leveraged loan borrower for years under Veritas ownership, and Carlyle Group Inc.\u2019s failed attempt to buy a 50% stake in 2023 had already put a spotlight on the potential financing. The proposed Carlyle deal would have valued Cotiviti at around $15 billion.\n\nPrivate credit funds were expected to finance that version of the deal with a $5.5 billion loan that would have ranked as the largest ever provided by direct lenders, Bloomberg News previously reported. KKR\u2019s deal gives Cotiviti a valuation of around $10.5 billion.\n\nKKR and Veritas were able to obtain a B2 rating from Moody\u2019s Investors Service for Cotiviti, which is five steps below investment grade but one notch higher than the company\u2019s old rating. This also helped drive demand from loan investors, the people said.\n\nThe two private equity firms acted as bookrunners on the debt sale, meaning they will share in the fees typically paid to investment banks for handling the process.\n\nMost of the big private equity sponsors now have their own capital markets teams to help find the best debt financing for their portfolio companies. But KKR stands out for regularly underwriting debt for other borrowers.\n\nLast year, KKR\u2019s ranking jumped 10 spots to number 18 in the league table for arranging broadly syndicated US leveraged loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nDeals\n\nChandra Daya Investasi has invested in 3-year senior notes as part of a private infrastructure asset-based securities placement by Bayfront Infrastructure Management Ares Management Corp. led a $3.3 billion private credit loan for UK insurance broker Ardonagh Group Ltd., with the debt\u2019s pricing among the lowest seen in direct lending A group of private credit lenders led by KKR & Co. and Oak Hill Advisors provided a $2.775 billion loan to help finance Clarience Technologies\u2019 acquisition of Safe Fleet\n\nFundraising\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s asset management division has launched its first European private credit fund for wealthy individuals Australia\u2019s biggest pension funds are losing their appetite for bonds as interest rates peak and are instead ramping up bets on private credit\n\nJob Moves\n\nU.S. Bank is launching a new division to provide financial services to private capital firms and global asset managers and has promoted Stephen Jeselson to run the team\n\nDid You Miss?\n\nPrivate Credit Pushes Into Banks\u2019 Infrastructure Lending Turf PE\u2019s Private Credit Push Can Pose Stability Risk, OCC\u2019s Hsu Says Wall Street Banks Are Trying Everything in Fight for LBO Deals Private Credit Funds to Get First Major Set of Rules in EU For Gensler, Financial Risks Lie Where Banks and Non-Banks Meet\n\n--With assistance from Jeannine Amodeo.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPlug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World\u2019s Biggest EV Market A24\u2019s Risky Hollywood Moment How Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

If you want to skip detailed analysis of Estate Planning sector, you can go directly to 5 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.\n\nEstate planning has been a practice since ancient times, with examples dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. Then, documents were used to ensure proper inheritance, typically favouring male heirs. The process involved witnesses, signatures, and the creator being of sound mind. Throughout history, various societies have had their own versions of inheritance laws, including references in ancient religious texts.\n\nHowever, in more recent history, the right to estate planning was reserved for a privileged elite, denying access to minority groups like Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Even after legal changes, many communities still lack easy access to education about estate planning. It is essential for underserved populations to have equal opportunities for creating estate plans to protect themselves and their families. Contrary to common belief, estate planning is not just for the wealthy and well-defined group of society but is important for everyone.\n\nAs of 2024, only 32% of Americans has a will, marking a 6% decline compared to 2023, the first drop in estate planning rates since 2020. The survey by Caring.com revealed that 40% of individuals without a will cited insufficient assets as the reason. Notably, lower-income Americans were twice as likely to mention this, reflecting the disproportionate impact of the economic situation on their decision-making regarding estate planning.\n\nIncome inequality has played a significant role in estate planning trends, with lower-income households experiencing more vulnerability to inflation and economic challenges. The decrease in estate planning rates is evident across different demographic groups, but young adults aged 18-34 are the only age group that has not experienced a decline since 2020. It is crucial to emphasize that estate planning is essential for everyone, not just the wealthy. Despite 64% of Americans acknowledging the importance of having a will, only 32% have one. This underscores the need for increased awareness and access to estate planning resources for all individuals, regardless of their financial circumstances.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trusts and Estates sector deals with managing trusts, estates, and agency accounts according to fiduciary agreements for beneficiaries. Revenue in this industry has seen a steady increase over the past five years, mainly driven by gains from assets held in trusts and regular dividends. The industry has benefited from strong performances in equity markets and housing price appreciation during this period. From 2018 to 2023, the industry's revenue has grown at an average annual rate of 2.8%, reaching $221.4 billion, with a projected 4.2% increase in 2023, as per IBIS World. However, we can't guarantee the accuracy of these figures.\n\nIn the world of estate planning, along with financial and investment planning, it\u2019s essential to look up various big players in the industry, namely, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

The sources used are namely, Srllp, Vaelderlaw, Wealthify, Due, and Kiplinger. We've ranked the list on discretion.\n\nWith his, let us now head on towards our list of 12 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n12. Business\n\n12th one our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child is family business, which is a common asset passed down to children as an inheritance, often with monetary value and a stable income source. This can provide financial security for them in the long term. However, businesses can be unpredictable and may fail if not managed effectively. It's crucial to ensure the business is financially sound and profitable when passing it down. Teaching children how to run the business early on can prepare them for potential future responsibilities.\n\n11. Annuity\n\nAn annuity is a valuable asset to leave for children, offering stable income and potential tax advantages, particularly with non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax funds. By annuitizing the annuity, children can convert it into a reliable income source to cover living expenses for a specified period or lifetime. An annuity helps manage the risk of outliving savings or market downturns. While it provides a stream of income, annuities may have limitations in flexibility and liquidity.\n\n10. Real Estate\n\nReal estate assets, acquired through hard work, can be a valuable inheritance for children, offering financial security and potential growth over time. In addition to safeguarding retirement funds, real estate properties with shared memories can create sentimental value for the heirs. Real estate is a safe investment with potential for growth and can provide financial security for children. However, it may come with maintenance costs and management responsibilities for beneficiaries.\n\n9. Brokerage Account\n\nA brokerage account, containing stocks and bonds, offers a valuable non-cash financial inheritance that can grow in value over time. These accounts allow for active trading before being transferred to children, who can benefit from the rising asset value gradually. One advantage of brokerage accounts is their divisibility, making it simple to distribute the assets among multiple children. Moreover, stocks are easily liquidated, providing access to cash when needed through the brokerage account.\n\n8. House in a Trust\n\nPlacing a house into a trust offers several benefits, including asset protection against potential risks like creditors, avoidance of probate for a quicker transfer to beneficiaries, potential tax advantages, and the ability for the settlor to maintain control over asset management. However, there are drawbacks to consider, such as the associated costs of establishing and maintaining a trust, the loss of control once the house is in the trust, the complexity of trust management, and limited flexibility with irrevocable trusts.\n\n7. Spendthrift Trust\n\nA spendthrift trust is a type of trust that restricts a beneficiary's access to trust assets based on conditions established by the grantor. This trust structure helps prevent beneficiaries from mismanaging their inheritance and safeguards trust assets from creditors. By disbursing funds incrementally rather than as a lump sum, a spendthrift trust can be beneficial if the beneficiary lacks financial maturity, tends to make impulsive decisions, is in significant debt, vulnerable to deceit, struggling with addiction, has special needs and receives government benefits, facing or anticipating divorce, or works in a litigious industry where asset protection is crucial. The pros of a spendthrift trust include protection from creditors targeting trust assets and a controlled distribution of funds over time.\n\n6. UTMA/UGMA Accounts\n\nUTMA/UGMA accounts, or Uniform Transfers to Minors/Uniform Gift to Minors accounts are placed 6th on our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child. They\u00a0are custodial arrangements that allow gifts to be held for minors who cannot own substantial assets themselves. These accounts enable a designated individual, possibly the donor, to manage the gifted funds until the minor reaches legal age, typically 18 or 21, depending on state laws.\n\nSetting up a UTMA/UGMA account is a straightforward process usually done through a local bank branch. However, the funds in the account are taxable to the child, and some investments may trigger tax consequences, potentially subjecting the child to higher tax rates. Consulting with an estate planning attorney is advisable to assess the implications. One concern with UTMA/UGMA accounts is that when the minor reaches the designated age, typically 18 or 21, they gain control of the account and can use the funds as they wish.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about 5 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n12 High Growth Real Estate Stocks that are Profitable Top 20 Most Valuable Insurance Companies in the US 15 States with the Cheapest Home Insurance in the US\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Big banks needed M&amp;A to roar back in 2024. It\u2019s happening.",
        "content": "Wall Street banks really needed dealmaking to make a comeback. It may finally be happening.\n\nThe volume of US mergers and acquisitions is up 130% so far this quarter, at $288 billion, according to data from Dealogic, while worldwide M&A is up 56% to $453 billion.\n\nThat surge includes three major deals announced this week in the US. Credit card lender Capital One (COF) said it would acquire rival Discover Financial Services (DFS) for roughly $35 billion. Charlotte based regional bank Truist Financial (TFC) said it would sell its remaining $15.5 billion stake in an insurance arm. And retailing giant Walmart (WMT) confirmed plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio (VZIO) for $2.3 billion.\n\nThe pacts could mean hundreds of millions in new fees for some of the biggest banks at a time when their traditional lending profits are expected to decline. Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) all had a hand in at least one of the transactions.\n\nThat trend \"we think will bode well for the balance of the year,\" Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said Tuesday at a Bank of America Securities conference.\n\nBig banks have been waiting two years for M&A to pick back up again. Last year was supposed to be the year things turned around; instead 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nA lot is riding on a Wall Street revival that sticks in 2024. That's because banks expect to see their traditional lending income drop as demand falls and margins get squeezed. The Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates at some point this year, and that could hurt the giant banks that were able to charge a lot more for their loans when rates were higher.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Loan growth is [a] dog fight right now,\" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said at a Bank of America Securities conference Wednesday, speaking to commercial borrowing usage by his company\u2019s large corporate clients. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nMason, the Citigroup CFO, added a note of caution about the M&A pickup. Even through \"we are seeing a significant increase in announced deals,\" the number of deals actually closing in the first quarter \"have not been that high.\"\n\nThere are many uncertainties still about the prospect for M&A throughout 2024, including what the Fed does on rates and how far the Biden administration goes in its campaign to scrutinize consolidations across a number of industries.\n\nLast month a federal court sided with the Justice Department\u2019s request to block JetBlue\u2019s (JBLU) $3.8 billion acquisition of rival Spirit Airlines (SAVE).\n\nA lot of other mergers also hang in the balance due to antitrust reviews, from the tie-ups of air carriers Alaska (ALK) and Hawaiian (HA) to grocery chains Kroger (KR) and Albertsons (ACI) to amusement park giants Six Flags (SIX) and Cedar Fair (FUN).\n\n\"The one thing we can be confident of is that the Biden administration will be tougher on mergers than the Trump administration so if I were trying to pull off a big merger, I'd wait until November,\" said Cornell Law School professor George Hay.\n\nBut clearly some companies are clearly willing to roll the dice on buying rivals, including Capital One. Its purchase of Discover would create one of the largest US credit card companies and a formidable new rival to American Express (AXP), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA). Capital One headquarters in McLean, Va. (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\n\nCapital One predicts the deal will close in late 2024 or early 2025 if it gets that regulatory approval.\n\n\"We doubt the timing is a coincidence. The deal is unlikely to close before the elections,\" Ian Katz, a managing director for Capital Alpha Partners, said Tuesday.\n\n\"If the Republicans win, approval becomes more likely. We think approval is also possible under Biden-appointed regulators, but the proposed deal will take many months and receive intense scrutiny.\"\n\nAnother big bank, PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), has also been making some noise about getting bigger as a way of surviving long term. Its CFO, Rob Reilly, made it clear Wednesday that the bank is not that concerned about regulatory pushback.\n\n\"We think should an opportunity arise for us... we think that there would be a large degree of regulatory support under the current setup,\" said Reilly, noting that he met with acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu last week.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Beth Hammack had been billed as one of the most likely candidates to break into Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s all-male top tier.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Surges After Company Proclaims AI Has Hit 'Tipping Point' Biden Touts $1.2 Billion in Student Loan Relief With Eye to 2024 China Tightens Grip on Stocks With Net Sale Ban at Open, Close Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Why Are There Suddenly So Many Car Washes?\n\nNow, she\u2019s calling it quits after 30 years at the Wall Street giant, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nHammack, 52, was once seen internally as a top choice to become the next chief financial officer \u2014 a rare elevation for a woman to one of the bank\u2019s most senior positions.\n\nEven on Wall Street, where men dominate most firms, the lack of women at Goldman\u2019s highest levels has been a sore point internally. No woman has ever been appointed to the role of chair, chief executive officer, president or CFO in the company\u2019s history.\n\nThat challenge was underscored last month when Goldman created two new committees within its investment bank. It tapped 25 executives as the emerging leaders who would have a say in running its sprawling trading and banking business.\n\nOnly three women made the cut, including Hammack, a former treasurer who most recently was a co-head of the firm\u2019s global financing group.\n\nGoldman has pledged to lift more women into its most senior roles, and for years Hammack had been among a small cohort who made the list in every behind-the-scenes conversation. Insiders saw her filling jobs that would have made her one of the bank\u2019s most prominent faces on Wall Street.\n\nRead More: Beth Hammack\u2019s Rise at Goldman Sachs\n\n\u201cGoldman Sachs is an extraordinary institution that manufactures the world\u2019s best executive talent. Beth had an incredible 30-year run of transforming businesses,\u201d said Katie Koch, the CEO of TCW Group and a former colleague. \u201cShe is unbelievably well positioned for her next leadership role.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nA representative for New York-based Goldman and Hammack declined to comment.\n\nMore Experience\n\nShe moved into her latest role running the financing unit after being passed over for CFO in 2021. At the time, the bank\u2019s executives explained the move as an effort to help her gain more experience running a revenue-generating group that would set her up for more senior positions later.\n\nHammack grew up outside Philadelphia and had two summer internships at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Her father, Howard Morgan, is a venture capitalist who helped billionaire Jim Simons start Renaissance Technologies. She joined Goldman in 1993 and began to climb the ranks within its trading division.\n\nShe held a variety of roles dealing with agency bonds, rates and repo trading. Her rise was driven by her ability to deal with regulators and government bodies after she made partner in 2010. Hammack also went on to chair the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee \u2014 an influential Wall Street group that has the ear of the US Treasury secretary. \u201cShe\u2019s a unique talent who dedicated her life to the firm,\u201d Jake Siewert, a Warburg Pincus partner said.\n\nHammack\u2019s elevation to treasurer in 2018 was a point of contention within the bank. Top executives disagreed about whether the trading unit could spare one of its rare senior women, highlighting the dilemma in its bid to diversify Goldman\u2019s highest ranks.\n\nWhen then-CFO Stephen Scherr left in 2021, Hammack was moved to the banking group, and the firm\u2019s leadership instead tapped Denis Coleman as the next finance chief.\n\n\u201cBeth always approached the business with a deep intellect,\u201d Scherr said. \u201cShe was among a small number of people who worked both as a trader and a banker. There is no doubt that her success at the firm was a product of that versatility.\u201d\n\nIsabelle Ealet became the first woman to run a major division at the firm in 2012, when she was tapped to lead the trading unit. Today, Stephanie Cohen is the only woman running one of the bank\u2019s three units. She\u2019s in charge of Platform Solutions, which is being dismantled as Goldman reverses its push into consumer banking.\n\nCohen has been on leave since June, and the firm\u2019s senior executives have said they don\u2019t expect her to come back. A company spokesman Tony Fratto said last year that Cohen will definitely return, and \u201cto suggest anything else is completely inaccurate.\u201d\n\nCohen didn\u2019t reply to messages seeking comment.\n\n(Updates with additional details and comments throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPlug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World\u2019s Biggest EV Market How Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs (GS) closed the most recent trading day at $388.27, moving +0.98% from the previous trading session. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.13% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.13%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.32%.\n\nShares of the investment bank witnessed a gain of 0.98% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Finance sector with its gain of 3.63% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.99%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Goldman Sachs in its forthcoming earnings report. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $8.62, marking a 1.93% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $13.05 billion, indicating a 6.75% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nGS's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $32.66 per share and revenue of $50.49 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +42.81% and +9.16%, respectively.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.43% higher. Goldman Sachs presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Goldman Sachs has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.77 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.79, so one might conclude that Goldman Sachs is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nWe can also see that GS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.35. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Financial - Investment Bank industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.16.\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 30, finds itself in the top 12% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Today\u2019s factories depend on technology for optimal and efficient assembly processes, and these new methods require semiconductors, chips and batteries to function. If that wasn\u2019t enough, a growing percentage of the population has access to laptops and smartphones, not to mention the developed nation\u2019s tendency to shift toward electric vehicles. Lithium stocks are set for a boom in the coming years, an indispensable addition to your portfolio.\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. SQM stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis one is a bit of an analyst favorite lately; operating within the world\u2019s largest lithium reserves in Chile, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is at the forefront of the explosive lithium demand to be commanded by the world\u2019s fastest-growing EV firms.\n\nYou may have heard that BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) has overtaken Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to become the world\u2019s largest seller of electric vehicles. It just so happens that BYD also landed an exclusive deal with Sociedad Quimica for lithium contracts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis means one thing for both the lithium miner and the EV company: pricing power and nearly guaranteed volumes in the commodity moving forward.\n\nConsidering that analysts now expect earnings per share to grow by 21.6% in the next 12 months, it should be no surprise to learn that a consensus price target of $69.1 a share would call for a 62.4% upside from today\u2019s prices.\n\nOne last thing: this stock reached an all-time high price of $115.7 a share in 2022, leaving today\u2019s prices to be an incredibly low bargain price for a stock attracting buy ratings and high price targets from Wall Street analysts.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nNo company can report 31.0% jumps in their revenues alongside 21.0% volume growth without having a well-defined tailwind behind it to push off. That is the case for Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) in their latest quarterly earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at The Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) expressed their interest in a manufacturing breakout in the United States economy; you can read the thesis behind the view in this 2024 macro outlook report. Knowing what you know now, if Goldman is right, then Albemarle is in for one heck of a rally in the coming quarters.\n\nGoldman isn\u2019t the only party pushing for a bullish case on Albemarle since today\u2019s consensus price target stands at $193.0 a share, implying a rally of up to 68.1% from where the stock trades today. EPS projections set at 25.3% growth for this year act as a justification for these valuation targets in the stock as well.\n\nAlmost a mirror image to Sociedad Quimica, Albemarle stock is trading at a fraction of its all-time high price of $334.5 a share in 2022. Your portfolio could surely use an irresistible discount in a new fundamental push to higher valuations as a watchlist addition.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but not least, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a company that promises the most potential upside for those with the stomach\u2014and the patience to handle prolonged periods of uncertainty and obscurity. Still, you are here for the big payoff, aren\u2019t you?\n\nThis company has yet to make revenues from its operations, as it only counts with the rights to exploration and development of lithium properties in the United States and Canada, which is why the stock price is so cheap today.\n\nOn the imminent news that they strike a lithium reserve to start marketing to customers, outlooks and price action could exceed your wildest expectations.\n\nAnalysts currently see a price target of $17.1 a share, which is a massive 296.9% above where it trades today to give you the highest potential of the group on the news of a lithium breakthrough. It would seem you now have the whole spectrum of risk-to-reward extremes in this list of lithium plays!\n\nAs of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser gets pay bump to $26 million after a 38% drop in profits",
        "content": "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser got a 6% pay bump for her performance in 2023, a year the bank's profits dropped 38% and Fraser began a dramatic restructuring that will result in an estimated 20,000 job cuts.\n\nThe board awarded her total compensation of $26 million, Citigroup said in a Tuesday regulatory filing. The amount includes a base salary of $1.5 million as well as $24.5 million in cash as well as deferred stock and performance based compensation units vesting in the coming years. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, testifies before a Senate committee last December. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nThe award, which was up from $24.5 million in 2022, reflected the board's \"belief that Ms. Fraser\u2019s strategic and other priorities are sound and that she is executing on them promptly and thoughtfully, with an eye towards driving long-term sustainable growth, improved returns and enhanced safety and soundness,\" according to the filing.\n\nThe $26 million for Fraser was the lowest among CEO rivals at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley who received between $29 million and $37 million. Bank of America's Brian Moynihan was the only CEO among this group to experience a compensation decline.\n\nFraser was named CEO in September 2020 and took over in February of 2021. Since then, the stock has risen more than 5%. So far this year, it has outperformed the stocks of all peers with a nearly 8% gain.\n\nFraser had a lot to navigate in 2023, including the largest profit decline among her big rivals and what she called the \"most consequential\" change to how the New York lender operates in nearly two decades.\n\nInstead of operating with two mega-divisions, she is splitting the bank into five separate units with leaders reporting directly to her. She made it clear this would mean fewer people.\n\n\"We'll be saying goodbye to some very talented and hard-working colleagues,\" Fraser wrote when she announced the moves in September.\n\nThe first layoffs began in November, affecting senior managers. In January the bank told analysts it plans to eliminate 20,000 positions by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nFraser is trying to focus the company on serving big, multinational corporations, shed what isn't profitable, and operate more efficiently.\n\nCiti has also pulled back from consumer banking in various parts of the world, having sold off nine of those businesses with plans to exit a total of 14 across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico.\n\nIt is also getting out of its US municipal bond business, dismantling yet another part of an empire amassed in the 1990s when Citigroup and its CEO Sandy Weill billed the bank as a \"financial supermarket\" that could offer any and all services needed by consumers, businesses, and governments.\n\nCitigroup reported a net loss of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter resulting from an FDIC assessment of $1.7 billion and other charges and reserves.\n\nFraser called the results \"very disappointing\" but said \"we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing our strategy in 2023.\"\n\nThis year, she added, would be a \"turning point.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "The recent war between Israel and the Palestine-based militant group Hamas has affected the global supply chain. Also, the prevailing war between Russia and Ukraine has prompted several governments, including the Biden administration, to impose sanctions on Russian oil and energy. Crude prices have gone up on supply concerns from Russia, which is one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of the commodity. Prices have risen further after the U.S. Government imposed a ban on the import of oil and other energy products.\n\nGeopolitical tensions are likely to keep markets volatile for some time, with the energy sector making the most of the opportunity.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on global equities to \"overweight\" on prospects of economic growth and recovery in manufacturing activity, after starting the year with a \"neutral\" rating across assets.\n\nRecent data has shown signs of improvement in global manufacturing activity, including in the United States, and market participants will assess incoming economic data to determine the trajectory of interest rate cuts of major central banks.\n\n\"We expect growth to become a more important driver of risk appetite and equity/bond correlations should be more negative this year,\" Goldman said in a note dated Feb. 16.\n\nThe brokerage added that monetary policy easing cycles have historically been supportive for risky assets but may be less so this year, \"as markets have already pre-traded much of the rates relief.\"\n\nTraders see about a 51.3% chance for the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nHowever, the potential for global earnings growth remains 'relatively muted' due to falling revenue growth and minimal room for margin improvement, Goldman said, although adds that global economic growth creates 'upside risks' to earnings growth.\n\n\"While equities have digested higher bond yields so far with better growth, there is a risk of shifting back to a \u2018good news is bad news\u2019 regime,\" Goldman cautioned.\n\nThe brokerage also downgraded global credit assets to \"underweight\" from \"neutral.\"\n\n\"Tight credit spreads are likely to become a speed limit to returns,\" the brokerage noted.\n\nGoldman reiterated its \"neutral\" rating on longer-dated global bonds and commodities.\n\n(Reporting by Siddarth S in Bengaluru; Editing by Eileen Soreng)",

        "content": "The board of Goldman Sachs (GS) awarded CEO David Solomon a 24% compensation increase for 2023 despite a profit decline and a dealmaking slowdown, offering a new show of support for Solomon after his most challenging year as boss.\n\nSolomon's compensation for the year was $31 million, the bank disclosed Friday. Not only is that up from the $25 million he was awarded in 2022, it is more than his rivals Brian Moynihan and Charles Scharf made at Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\nOnly JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and outgoing Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman were awarded more for their 2023 performance. Citigroup (C) has yet to disclose 2023 compensation for its CEO Jane Fraser.\n\nThe compensation increase could be a sign that board support for Solomon is solidifying after he spent much of 2023 attempting a tricky retrenchment from consumer lending while focusing the firm on its core strengths of trading, asset management, and investment banking.\n\nProfits were down 24% at the Wall Street giant as dealmaking slowed across the industry and the firm absorbed costs associated with its consumer lending exit.\n\nIts full-year net income of $8.52 billion was the worst mark for Goldman since 2019, Solomon's first full year in charge. The firm did, however, post a sizable gain in the fourth quarter as equities trading and wealth management rose. Goldman CEO David Solomon. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA lot is in flux at Goldman as key executives depart, raising new questions about the race to eventually succeed Solomon.\n\nOne surprise exit in 2024 is Jim Esposito, who had been co-head of Goldman\u2019s global banking and markets division and is leaving after nearly three decades. Esposito had been viewed on Wall Street as among the possible successors to Solomon.\n\nThat departure could focus attention on other potential CEO candidates, including president John Waldron, asset and wealth management head Marc Nachmann, or one of the other co-heads of the investment banking and trading operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven the board of Goldman is changing. Last month ex-Goldman CFO David Viniar was named as the board\u2019s lead director to replace Adebayo Ogunlesi, who stepped down after selling his infrastructure investment company to BlackRock. Former Goldman CFO David Viniar is now lead director of the Wall Street giant. Here he is pictured testifying before Senate lawmakers in 2010. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\nThe board awarded Solomon, who serves as board chair, $29 million in a discretionary bonus of which 70% is performance-based stock units. His $31 million in compensation also includes a base salary of $2 million.\n\nGoldman\u2019s stock peaked in August 2021, in the middle of the last dealmaking boom, at $420.73. Since Solomon was named CEO in October 2018, it has risen 72%. Year to date, the stock is down slightly.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Goldman (GS) Up 0.2% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Goldman Sachs (GS). Shares have added about 0.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Goldman due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nGoldman Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/Y\n\nGoldman\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $5.48 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.47. Also, the bottom line increased 65% from the year-earlier quarter.\r\n\r\nGoldman\u2019s results have been supported by strength in the consumer banking business, while FICC revenues declined.\r\n\r\nNet earnings of $2 billion rose 51% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nFor 2023, the company reported net earnings of $8.25 billion, plunging 24% year over year.\n\nRevenues Increase, Expenses Rise\n\nNet revenues of $11.32 billion for the quarter increased 7% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.71 billion.\r\n\r\nNet revenues of $46.25 billion for 2023 dipped 2% from the year-ago quarter. Nonetheless, the top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $45.6 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses increased 5% year over year to $8.48 billion. Higher depreciation and amortization, and other expenses led to the increase.\r\n\r\nProvision for credit losses was $577 million, down 41% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nQuarterly Segmental Performance Mixed\n\nThe Asset & Wealth Management division generated revenues of $4.38 billion in the reported quarter, up 23% year over year. Results reflect higher fees from equity investments and incentive fees, offset by higher private banking and lending.\r\n\r\nFirmwide assets under supervision were a record $2.81 trillion, up from $2.68 trillion in the prior quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Global Banking & Markets division has recorded revenues of $6.35 billion, down 3% year over year. The fall indicated a decline in the investment banking business (down 12%) and lower net revenues in FICC (down 24%), offset by higher equities revenues (up 26%).\r\n\r\nThe Platform Solutions division\u2019s revenues were $577 million, rising 12% year over year. The jump was driven by significantly higher revenues from consumer platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nCapital Ratios Deteriorate\n\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, the standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5%, down from the prior-year quarter\u2019s 15%. The company\u2019s supplementary leverage ratio was 5.5%, down from the prior-year quarter\u2019s 5.8%.\n\nCapital Distribution Update\n\nIn 2023, Goldman returned $9.39 billion of capital to common shareholders. This included $5.80 million in share repurchases and common stock dividends of $3.59 billion.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nThe company expects tax rate to be within the 22-23% band.\n\nMedium-Term Targets\n\nThe company expected to achieve gross inflows of $225 billion for alternative investments from 2020 through 2024 end. It succeeded in achieving this target a year earlier. \u00a0\r\n\r\nGoldman expects to achieve more than $10 billion in firmwide management and other fees in 2024. Of this, more than $2 billion in alternative management fees are expected.\r\n\r\nIn its efforts to reduce balance sheet density, the company intends to reduce the historical principal investment portfolio by less than $15 billion by 2024 and completely exit the portfolio within the next three to five years.\r\n\r\nThrough the cycle, Goldman targets a ROE of 14-16%, a return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROTE) of 15-17% and an efficiency ratio of 60%.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Goldman has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nGoldman has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "CoreCard Corporation (NYSE:CCRD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 14, 2024\n\nCoreCard Corporation beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.06, expectations were $0.01. CoreCard Corporation isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreCard Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Matt White, CFO. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt White: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call today is Leland Strange, Chairman and CEO of CoreCard Corporation. He will add some additional comments and answer questions at the conclusion of my prepared remarks. Before I start, I'd like to remind everyone that during the call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand CoreCard Corporation and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainty and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factor that may affect future operations are included in our filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted diluted EPS, which is adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables included with our earnings release. As we noted in our press release, our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, and with continued year-over-year growth in processing and maintenance revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $12.2 million, a 23% decrease year-over-year. Services revenue, defined as total revenue excluding license revenue, decreased 13% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, with full year growth of 1%. The components of our revenue for the fourth quarter consisted of professional services revenue of $6.1 million, processing and maintenance revenue of $5.5 million and third-party revenue of $0.5 million. Processing and maintenance revenues grew 8% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis with full year growth of 18%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe decline in professional services revenue was driven by lower demand for development personnel from Goldman Sachs, our largest customer. As a reminder, we converted the managed services revenue we received from Goldman, which is included in professional services, to a fixed monthly fee of $1 million, which is contracted through June 30, 2025. Maintenance revenue from Goldman was approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and that is contracted through June 30, 2026. Revenue growth, excluding our largest customer and excluding the impact from ParkMobile, which we talked about in the last quarter, and the legacy Kabbage business, which is currently in runoff, was 12% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis and 13% for the full year.\n\nWe continue to onboard new customers, both directly and through various partnerships we have with program managers such as Deserve, Vervent and Cardless. We currently have multiple implementations in progress with new customers that we expect to go live in the coming months. However, these new customers typically build their account base prudently, remember they're issuing credit, paying mostly our minimum fees initially of around $10,000 to $15,000 per month in the initial 12 to 18 months of their program. We expect our new customers to become more significant over time as they grow their own business at a measured pace. Now, turning to some additional highlights for the fourth quarter and full year for 2023. Income from operations was $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to income from operations of $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nOur operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3% compared to an operating margin of 19% for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline in our operating margin was primarily driven by continued investments in our new platform, hiring in India and lower license and professional services revenue year-over-year. The income statement impact of our new platform build was $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.8 million for the full year. Those amounts are included in our development expenses on our income statement. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 tax rate was 24.5% and 27.1%, respectively. We expect our ongoing tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.06 compared to $0.12 for the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFull year 2023 diluted EPS was $0.40 compared to $1.61 for the full year 2022. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter, excluding the fourth quarter 2022 impact of a write-down of one of our equity method investments was $0.06 compared to $0.24 for Q4 2022. Full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS was $0.52 compared to $1.74 for the full year 2022. We generated significant operating cash flows in 2023 of $16.8 million. We used $3.7 million on share repurchases in 2023, including $2.1 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2023. We have excess cash on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, and we expect to continue generating operating cash flow in 2024. We plan to use this excess cash and cash generated from operations to continue investing in our new platform and to continue buying back shares, especially at current price levels. A financial specialist working on a digital platform managing accounts receivable & loan transactions.\n\nFor 2024, we expect services revenue to be approximately flat and license revenue of approximately $1.4 million, coming in the second half. We expect growth from customers, excluding our largest customer and excluding the impact of ParkMobile and legacy Kabbage, which is all services revenue, to be approximately 11%. Within services, we expect continued growth in processing and maintenance as our customers continue to grow and as we add new customers. We anticipate professional services revenue in the first quarter of 2024 in the range of $6 million to $6.2 million. And with that, I'll turn it over to Leland.\n\nLeland Strange: Yeah, thanks, Matt. Let me just say start planning your questions now because my comments are going to be short. First, let me comment on the lack of license revenue for the quarter. As most of you know, license revenue comes in buckets of about 1 million new cards and we had none. And I don't think we expect it in the first half of the year. There have been pundits trying to extrapolate the success or failure or the growth or lack of growth or maybe just translate that to measure the success of the card program of our largest customer. That's bad logic and a mistake. The largest individual brand processed on our software continues to grow their program, and it continues to be a phenomenal success. How can that be if there are no new license as well.\n\nOur licensee process more than one program with their license from CoreCard. And the CoreCard license revenue is not split by program, but it's for the total number of active cards that they process. For example, if one of the programs should clean their books by canceling old unused cards, that would be one way that will slow new license revenue and could possibly mislead one as the growth of the other program. Also, the license revenues on active cards, depending on definition, some cards could become inactive. I should say here, however, that the largest program of the system probably has the most average number of transactions of any large program [that I've ever seen] (ph). The cardholders love the card. They also use it for breakfast, lunch and dinner on the same day, plus a lot of other daily transactions.\n\nSo, it's a very, very good program. And even though we may not have new license revenue in the first half, the program itself is growing at a good rate. Second, let me comment on Matt's statement that the projected adjusted growth for services in 2024 is about 11%. Now, I'm not happy with that slow growth rate, but he's probably right based on the new business we're currently working with. I'm hopeful we can squeeze some other business in this year or that some of them will grow faster than projected, but it may end up being in that range. Third, as most of you know, we've historically not spent much of this development and have been in a good position of business finding us. Well, that was done in the past, and we recognize that we were prioritizing providing excellent service for our largest partner to enable their growth plans.\n\nNow that their growth plans have changed, we're also changing. We've added sales, they add more and will beef up a marketing program. It's still true that the larger potential clients and the consultants who know them are keenly aware of which issuing processors are capable of handling their potential business. But we still need to make certain that we have a voice at the table in their discussions, so we'll be adding to that. I think for 2024, we'll add to business development expenses, we'll continue with building in our next-generation software, while at the same time, we'll be lowering the headcount areas that are not growing as we had anticipated. By the way, our new platform is now called [Corefinity] (ph), that's the inside name, but we've recently introduced the first output of that effort into our own core processing environment.\n\nIt's a service that we offer to our customers. Some of the output from the new platform development will go into our current processing environment and some of it will not be available until the second half of next year when we finish it. Let me just -- I guess, just summarize that we're focused on the continued growth of processing and maintenance revenues outside of Goldman. And as I've just mentioned, we're doing that partly with adding some expense in those areas. We do have increased revenue visibility. The Goldman revenues are now longer-term contracted and they're recurring in nature. We do have reduced customer concentration, and that's a bump in the road today towards a healthier customer base going forward. As we continue to grow non-Goldman revenue, that's the measure of the success for the company, I think.\n\nMake sure we have a new platform coming on. And then, of course, our cash flow is positive. We have a very strong balance sheet, with no debt. If you look at the bigger picture, card issues globally is strong and continues to grow despite economic conditions. CoreCard gets paid on a number of cards issued. So, even in an economic downturn, we're fad. Our differentiation is simply CoreCard competes on program innovation, customization, flexibility, speed, premium service levels, and while the legacy service providers, they do have skilled advantages, although at some point, I'll talk about that because I think they're not what they appear to be, the aspects that CoreCard offer are highly distinct from the competition, and have driven customer wins in the past, and we think we'll continue to do so.\n\nWith that, I'll open it for questions if we have any.\n\nSee also Top 15 Electric Bike Brands According to Reddit and 30 Highest-Grossing Media Franchises of All Time.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "title": "15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best strong buy stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of analyst ratings and the finance industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe financial services industry is one of the biggest in the world, and just like oil, its smooth functioning is indispensable for global economic well being. A financial firm can be of several types and cater to the money needs and requirements of a wide variety of customers. The firms can range from small, regional, and mega banks, to credit services providers, savings and loan associations, multi billion dollar asset management funds, sharply managed hedge funds, and of course, investment management companies such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBroadly speaking, while the finance industry is involved in the business of managing money, it's investment banks and analysts who are responsible for shaping investor attention. They do this by preparing stock coverage reports and assigning ratings and price targets to publicly traded companies. The share price targets, ratings, earnings, revenue estimates, and notes are the primary ways through which analysts evaluate an equity. Their opinions are also some of the most reliable indicators of a share price's movements as every earnings cycle investor reacts to a publicly traded stock's revenue and EPS meeting or missing analyst estimates, Similarly, during any business day, a share price upgrade or downgrade by mega investment banks and behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).\n\nAdditionally, just because these banks or others evaluate stocks doesn't mean that they don't get evaluated themselves. As long as they're publicly traded and are of sufficient size to justify expending resources on, the banks that analysts work for are evaluated by their peers as well with the only limitation being that analysts from, say, JPMorgan cannot write investment notes about their own bank.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince dozens of analysts cover big ticket names such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the most common way in which share price ratings or price targets are covered in the press is by averaging them. For instance, as part of our look at ten stocks with rising share price targets, Insider Monkey analyzed data for firms such as Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Insider Monkey used share price target averages ranging from 31 analysts for Costco, to 44 analysts covering Uber's shares. This is unsurprising as well, since analysts typically work for financial services firms that are classified as Sell Side.\n\nA sell side analyst works for a bank that manages money for clients that end up buying stocks. So, if there's a potential for a stock to attract significant investor funds, then a bank is incentivized to cover it and assign share ratings and share price targets. Therefore, the fact that more analysts cover Uber than Goldman is unsurprising. After all, Uber was one of the first movers in the ride hailing application space, and while its income statement struggled to come out of a 'high growth look' that focuses on revenue instead of profit, the firm is one of the leading players in industries with disruptive potential such as urban air mobility.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best strong buy stocks to invest in so that we can see which stocks with strong buy ratings are also favorites among hedge funds. Some notable stocks in this list are Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Valaris Limited (NYSE:VAL), and Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNTH). 15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In\n\nA close-up of a hand, counting the money from the subscription fees of the Entertainment Communication Services company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best strong buy stocks to invest in, we first made a list of the 30 most valuable stocks with a market capitalization greater than $300 million and share price upside greater than 50% that had Strong Buy ratings on average. Then, they were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2023, and the best strong buy stocks are as follows.\n\nFor these best strong buy stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In\n\n15. Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

        "title": "The Next Coca-Cola? 3 Beverage Stocks That Investors Shouldn\u2019t Ignore.",
        "content": "Two of the most successful companies in U.S. history are centered around beverage products. Of course, I\u2019m talking about Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The two firms\u2019 sodas have become well-known and popular in much of the world, with KO, in particular, becoming quite ubiquitous globally. As a result of these trends, the market capitalizations of Coca-Cola and Pepsi are a huge $257 billion and $240 billion, respectively. But other U.S. beverage firms have also been successful. For example, the market capitalizations of Keurig Dr. Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) are now $44 billion and $59 billion, respectively.\n\nWhile we may not see another Coca-Cola or PepsiCo in our lifetimes, the beverage sector is very lucrative for some companies. Here are three beverage stocks that can grow explosively over the long term. And who knows? Maybe one of these firms could catch fire and become the next Coke or Pepsi.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonster is a leader in the U.S. energy-drink category and that category is rapidly growing. According to Statista, the revenue generated by energy drinks in America jumped 13.7% in 2022 and 12.9% in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s not surprising that Monster\u2019s top and bottom lines are also rapidly increasing. In Q3 of last year, for example, its revenue jumped 16% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income surged 40% year-over-year (YoY) to $453 million.\n\nAlso encouraging is that the revenue generated by Monster\u2019s emerging alcoholic beverages jumped 58% YoY to $42.3 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the Street is quite upbeat on MNST. In December, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) identified MNST as one of 37 high-growth stocks with low volume. In January, it identified the name as a high-quality growth stock.\n\nAnd last month, Goldman (NYSE:GS) identified MNST as one of the top beneficiaries of strong return-on-equity growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe popularity of Celsius\u2019 (NASDAQ:CELH) healthy carbonated energy drink offerings is growing rapidly, and the firm is taking market share in the popular category. Indeed, as I noted in a previous column, CELH\u2019s \u201crevenue soared 105% in the four-week period that ended on December 30,\u201d according to research firm Nielsen.\n\nThe firm has already expanded to Canada and intends to start selling its beverages in a wide variety of countries over the longer term. Of course, Celsius\u2019 overseas expansion should cause its growth to accelerate to even more impressive levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019 sales doubled in the first three quarters of 2024, and the fact that it\u2019s offering healthy, fairly good-tasting (in my view) products in the rapidly growing energy-drink category leaves it well-positioned to be extremely successful down the road.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gave CELH a fairly high Composite Rating of 83 out of 99.\n\nZevia PBC (ZVIA) Food Trends\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/rsi1986\n\nZeviaPBC (NYSE:ZVIA) markets its namesake sodas that, as far as I can tell, are the only carbonated beverages available on a wide scale sweetened solely by stevia.\n\nUnlike sugar, stevia has no calories or known, major, negative impact on people\u2019s health. Moreover, the chemicals used to make diet sodas, such as aspartame, have also been identified as potentially having very negative effects on humans. For example, the International Agency for Research on Cancer found that aspartame may cause cancer, and some indications show it could undermine memory.\n\nAs someone who drinks both Zevia\u2019s products and diet soda rather frequently, I can attest that, in my view, Zevia\u2019s sodas taste around 20% to 30% better than diet sodas.\n\nZevia\u2019s top line dropped 2.6% in Q3 versus the same period a year earlier, while it generated a per-share loss of 16 cents.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s gross margin of 45% is quite high, indicating it could increase its sales and market share a great deal by lowering its prices. What\u2019s more, the firm reported in November that it had supply chain issues and was taking multiple steps to rectify them.\n\nFinally, ZVIA reported \u201cthe world\u2019s largest retailer,\u201d presumably WalMart (NYSE:WMT), had been trialing \u201cthe brand\u2019s performance in the mainstream carbonated soft aisle.\u201d Sales of Zevia\u2019s products at WMT jumped by triple-digit percentage levels and were \u201coutperforming expectations,\u201d Zevia added.\n\nThe superior healthiness of Zevia\u2019s beverages and its success at WalMart bodes very well for the long-term outlook of ZVIA stock.\n\nGiven these points, I think it has the highest ceiling among beverage stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "25 Largest Economies in the World by 2040",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 largest economies in the world by 2040. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Economies in the World by 2040.\n\nGlobal Economic Outlook\n\nThe current scenario of the global economy doesn\u2019t give us a clear picture of the near-term economic situation with certainty. The recent major events that led to global economic uncertainty began with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was followed by worldwide lockdowns, supply chain distributions, international trade cut-offs, downsizing, and most importantly, a crisis in the global health sector. As we mentioned earlier, the economy seems to be in the recovery stage with global growth expected to remain steady at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025.\n\nAccording to research by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), the world\u2019s fastest years of economic growth have likely already passed. Population growth is weakening, climate change, and increasing geopolitical risks, among other factors will impact the global economy. However, the emerging economies and major economies in Asia are directed to keep catching up to richer countries. According to the IMF'sGDP forecast for 2030, 16 Asian countries will be among the leading economies. China, India, Indonesia, and Japan will be among the top six economies by 2050 along with the US and Germany. As per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:GS) 2075 forecast, China will be the leading economy with India in second place, the US in third place, and Indonesia in fourth. Nigeria and Pakistan will climb up the ranks to fifth and sixth place in 2075, respectively.\n\nThe global economy is forecasted to grow at an average of 2.8% annually between 2024 and 2029 and to gradually decline thereafter, as per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). This shows a slow economic growth compared to an average growth rate of 3.6% for the 10 years before the global financial crisis and 3.2% in the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason for slow economic growth is due to the ebbing population growth rate. During the past 50 years, the global population has halved. According to UN projections, the world\u2019s population is expected to increase by almost 2 billion in the next 30 years. This would mean that in 2050 the world\u2019s population will reach 9.7 billion from the current population of 8 billion. The global population could peak at a forecasted 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s. Apart from the population, economists expect weakening productivity to be another key reason for slow GDP growth in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the slow economic growth worldwide, emerging economies will keep on growing more swiftly than developed economies. China is most likely to overtake the US by 2035, becoming the world\u2019s largest economy. China, India, and Indonesia have outperformed Goldman Sachs economists\u2019 forecasts from 2011, while Brazil, Russia, and Latin America have underperformed Goldman Sachs\u2019 projections. According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:GS) economists:\n\n\u201cWe expect that the weight of global GDP will shift (even) more towards Asia over the next 30 years.\u201d\n\nCorporations: A Key Driver of Economic Growth\n\nCorporations are always a key element in driving the growth of an economy. The US is way ahead of most economies as far as the dominance of corporations is concerned around the world. Leading firms including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are key to the US economic progress. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are bigger than most economies, having a market capitalization of $2.92 trillion and $3.12 trillion, as of February 10.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a big player in the tech sector. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $2.18, beating consensus estimates by $0.08 per share. The revenue came in at $119.58 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.31 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made the following comments during its Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cWe achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading global tech firm. On January 30, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing estimates by $0.16. Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $62.02 billion for Q2 2024, ahead of market consensus by $888.19 million. The company continues to expand its cloud and AI network. Here are some of the comments from the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cIt was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage.

And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.\u201d\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the largest economies in the world by 2040.  25 Largest Economies in the World by 2040\n\n25 Largest Economies in the World by 2040\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe have compiled the largest economies in the world by 2040 based on projections made by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). To check the room for subjectivity, we also referred to forecasts made by the IMF and PwC for the biggest economies in the world in 2028 and 2050, respectively. To rank the largest economies in the world by 2040, we used the forecasted real GDP for 2040 from The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:GS) Global Economics Paper The Path to 2075. For the countries with similar forecasted real GDP in 2040, we used Population as a tie-breaker. We collected population data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "British economy 5pc smaller because of Brexit, claims Goldman Sachs",
        "content": "uk economy\n\nBritain\u2019s economy is 5pc smaller than it would have been without Brexit and leaving the EU has made the inflation crisis worse, analysts at Goldman Sachs have claimed.\n\nEconomists James Moberly and Sven Jari Stehn at the US investment bank argued that the economy was suffering \u201ca significant long-run output cost of Brexit\u201d in a note sent to investors.\n\nTrade, migration and business investment have all taken a hit since the Brexit referendum in ways which held back GDP growth, they argued.\r\n\r\nThe analysts wrote: \u201cThe UK economy has notably underperformed other advanced economies since the EU referendum in June 2016.\n\n\u201cUK real GDP per capita has barely risen above pre-Covid levels and now stands 4pc above the mid-2016 level. This compares with 8pc for the eurozone and 15pc for the US.\u201d\n\nThe economists said comparison to a model of a \u201cDoppelganger\u201d Britain that had remained in the EU suggested that the economy was now 5pc smaller than it otherwise would have been had it remained in the bloc.\n\nMr Moberly and Mr Jari Stehn acknowledged \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d over their estimate, putting the potential range of the hit to GDP at between 4pc and 8pc.\n\nOther economists said Goldman\u2019s estimate exaggerated the impact of leaving the EU and laid the blame for underperformance at the door of the Bank of England, rather than Brexit.\n\nMr Moberly and Mr Jari Stehn also noted that in some areas, such as trade in services, the economy has performed better than expected.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Brexit forecasts have in the past proved misguided. Goldman Sachs predicted the UK would fall into a recession if it left the EU at the time of the referendum, a fate which the economy ultimately avoided.\n\nIn the new investment note sent to clients last week, Goldman Sachs said the cost of living had jumped by 31pc in the UK since the vote to leave the EU. This is worse than the 27pc increase seen over the same period in the US and the 24pc rise in the eurozone.\n\nMr Moberly and Mr Jari Stehn said trade in goods had fallen since the Brexit vote, even as it rose across G7 countries on average. At the same time, \u201cinvestment growth stalled after the referendum, falling significantly below its pre-2016 trend.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nChanges in immigration since Brexit have also hit the economy, the pair argued. Although overall migration has jumped since Brexit, \u201cmany recent arrivals are students, meaning that immigration may be playing less of a role in boosting labour supply than the headline numbers suggest\u201d, they wrote.\n\n\u201cEU immigrants tended to have high labour market participation rates, as many of them entered the UK specifically to work.\u201d\n\nJonathan Portes, professor at King\u2019s College London and senior fellow at the think tank UK in a Changing Europe, said Goldman\u2019s estimate of the economic impact of Brexit was too high. He said the impact was more likely in the region of 2pc to 3pc of GDP.\n\nThe Institute of Economics Affairs said the inflation crisis was worse in Britain than other advanced economies because the Bank of England over-stimulated the economy with low interest rates, not because of Brexit.\n\nJulian Jessop, fellow at the IEA, said the analysis \u201cignores many other factors that may also have changed, including the different impacts of shocks such as Covid and the energy crisis, and the different policy responses in individual countries\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThese models also assume that any hit from Brexit is permanent and irreversible. Investment in particular should continue to recover as uncertainty clears.\n\n\u201cExports and imports should also pick up again as businesses adjust and as new trade deals come online.\u201d\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has grown faster than Germany since leaving the EU and the IMF has said our medium-term growth outlook is brighter than many of our neighbours on the Continent, including France and Germany.\n\n\u201cThe Government is making the most of Brexit freedoms to grow the economy, including repealing financial services law inherited from the EU so we can unlock reforms with the potential for \u00a3100bn in investment over 10 years.\u201d",

        "title": "Here's Why You Should Hold Goldman (GS) in Your Portfolio Now",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS is well poised for growth as it is focusing on its core businesses. The company\u2019s steady capital distributions and solid balance sheet position augur well. However, elevated costs are major headwinds.\n\nGoldman is refocusing its business on its core strengths of investment banking (IB) and trading, while reducing its consumer banking footprint.\u00a0In fourth-quarter 2023, it sold its Personal Financial Management unit to Creative Planning. Further, during the quarter, it sold the majority of GreenSky\u2019s loan portfolio and also entered into an agreement with a consortium led by Sixth Street Partners to divest GreenSky. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGS aims to cease unsecured loan offerings to consumers through Marcus. In 2023, it sold entire of Marcus\u2019 loan portfolio.\u00a0Apart from these divestitures, the company is offloading its credit card program with General Motors.\n\nFocus on core businesses is a strategic fit, given Goldman\u2019s\u00a0top position in worldwide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&As), equity and equity-related offerings, and common stock offerings.\u00a0It witnessed strong improvement in its M&A backlog in fourth-quarter 2023 and expects various initial public offerings in 2024.\n\nWe believe robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, signs of growing M&A and underwriting pipelines, and the company\u2019s decent IB backlog are expected to support IB revenues in the upcoming period. We expect IB fees to rise 8.8% and 3.4% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nThe company is making efforts to diversify its business mix toward more recurring revenues and durable earnings. These are underlined by the buyout of NN Investment and robo-advisor NextCapital. These moves are aimed at bolstering international presence, as well as wealth and asset management capabilities.\n\nGS maintains a solid balance sheet position. It exited fourth-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $242 billion and total unsecured debt (comprising long and short-term borrowings) of $318 billion. Out of this, only $76 billion were near-term borrowings. The company's solid liquidity profile aids sustainable capital distributions.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Goldman might see limited market-making opportunities in the Global Banking and Markets division. The segment\u2019s revenues witnessed a decline in 2022 and 2023 due to an increasingly challenging market-making backdrop. Future performance of this volatility-driven division depends on market developments and client volumes, which remain uncertain. We forecast segmental revenues to decline 3.4% in 2024.\n\nGS\u2019s bottom-line growth has been affected in the past few years by its escalating cost base. Moreover, investments in technology, market development expenses for business expansion and a rise in transaction-based expenses during periods of higher client activity will keep the expense base elevated in the upcoming period. Our model estimates total non-interest expenses to witness a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% over the next three years ending 2026.\n\nOver the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 17.5% compared with the industry's growth of 17.1%.

        "content": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS is being investigated for fees that it charges for futures trading. The investigation is being carried out following a whistle-blower tip. The news was first reported by Bloomberg, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) has privately authorized sending warrants to GS to receive information about fees charged for some futures block trades.\r\n\r\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment and the CFTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, GS had to pay more than $50 million in fines to the CFTC to settle a couple of cases.\r\n\r\nIn April, the investment bank agreed to pay $15 million to settle claims that it had failed to make proper disclosures and communicate fairly to swap customers.\r\n\r\nIn August, the bank was charged with a civil penalty of $5.5 million, per the CFTC\u2019s order. The order required GS to cease and desist from committing future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC\u2019s record-keeping provisions.\r\n\r\nPer the CFTC\u2019s findings, GS had violated the provisions of a previous order, and failed to appropriately record and retain certain audio files.\r\n\r\nIn November 2019, Goldman Sachs was levied with a civil penalty of $1 million for failure to record the phone lines of its trading and sales desk in January and February of 2014 for 20 calendar days. The CFTC\u2019s order required the company to cease and desist from further violations of record-keeping regulations.\r\n\r\nHowever, post the 2019 order, GS continued to have record-keeping failures, which were in violation of the cease-and-desist provisions. It failed to record and retain audio calls due to failure in both its hardware and software systems.\r\n\r\nThen again, the bank had to pay $30 million for failing to diligently supervise a wide range of its swap dealer activities and for extraordinary failures regarding swap data reporting.\r\n\r\nOver the past six months, shares of GS have gained 12.4% compared with the industry\u2019s 4% rally.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, GS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The firm\u2019s U.S. wealth management business, earlier known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, was charged with failing to protect customers\u2019 personal information while shutting down two data centers in 2016.\r\n\r\nMS was accused of negligence in properly decommissioning computers that contained unencrypted customer data.\r\n\r\nAccording to the agreement released by attorney general James, \u201cMorgan Stanley failed to decommission its computers and erase unencrypted data in certain computer devices that were later auctioned while still containing consumers\u2019 personal information, including data belonging to 1.1 million New Yorkers.\u201d\r\n\r\nLikewise, Washington Trust Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s WASH wholly-owned subsidiary, The Washington Trust Company, agreed on a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve allegations that Washington Trust violated fair lending laws in Rhode Island between 2016 and 2021.\r\n\r\nWASH was required to provide $7 million in mortgage loan subsidies for mortgage, home improvement or refinance loans in specific census tracts in Rhode Island over five years.\r\n\r\nAlso, the company had to commit $2 million for focused community outreach and marketing efforts.\r\n\r\nThe settlement did not include any civil monetary penalties.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors in Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) have seen solid returns of 125% over the past five years",
        "content": "Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) share price is up 100% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 74% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 7.9% , including dividends .\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group's earnings per share are down 2.7% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.\n\nSo it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nIn contrast revenue growth of 6.9% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Goldman Sachs Group is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nGoldman Sachs Group is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this freereport showing consensus forecasts\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Goldman Sachs Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 125%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nGoldman Sachs Group shareholders are up 7.9% for the year (even including dividends). But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 18% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Goldman Sachs Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A top US financial regulator has opened an investigation into whether Goldman Sachs Group Inc. improperly charged fees to execute some of its clients\u2019 futures trades, the latest regulatory headache for the bank.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on China Ukraine\u2019s Army Chief Leaves After Rift With Zelenskiy Epstein Contacted Staley for Years at Barclays Using Go-Between, Court Filings Claim Citadel Among Hedge Funds That Got Morgan Stanley\u2019s Block-Trading Leaks Xi\u2019s Markets Shakeup Surprised Insiders, Showing Alarm Over Rout\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission privately authorized sending subpoenas to Goldman for information about fees charged for some futures block trades, according to people familiar with the matter. The probe stems from a whistle-blower tip, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential probe.\n\nGoldman agreed to pay more than $50 million to settle at least four CFTC cases last year, including three that were announced in the space of five weeks. While the penalties totaled less than one day of revenue for the New York-based bank, the string of settlements saw the bank publicly called out as a repeat offender by one commissioner.\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s top enforcement attorney, Ian McGinley, said in October that the agency would begin to take a tougher stance on firms accused of repeatedly breaking the agency\u2019s rules, including through harsher penalties and admissions of guilt.\n\nRepresentatives for Goldman and CFTC declined to comment on the latest probe. Investigations by the regulator don\u2019t always lead to enforcement actions and Goldman hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing by the regulator.\n\nRead More: US Regulator Pledges Harsher Punishment for Wall Street Misdeeds\n\nIn September, Goldman agreed to pay the CFTC $30 million penalty for failing to \u201cdiligently\u201d supervise its swap-dealer activities and other alleged violations. The regulator also fined the bank $3 million over its surveillance of a customer\u2019s large position in an oil futures contract. The bank didn\u2019t admit or deny the allegations in either case.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest probe into fees charged is focused on whether Goldman failed to properly keep tabs on the activities of its futures brokerage, which is registered with the CFTC, said one of the people. It involves the use of computer software to assess fees that Goldman allegedly knew contained coding errors and the charges being scrutinized are relatively small, added the person.\n\nGoldman is enlisting several hundred new staffers and devoting other resources within the firm to help address operational concerns from the Federal Reserve, which oversees the lender, Bloomberg News reported last year.\n\nRead More: Goldman Plans Hiring Spree to Fix Lapses Amid Fed\u2019s Scrutiny\n\nThe bank has also recently tangled with US regulators over its activities in the US stock market.\n\nIn September, Goldman agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $6 million for alleged inaccurate reporting of 163 million trades. Days earlier, the lender said it would pay a $3 million fine to the industry-backed Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to settle allegations it wrongly marked tens of millions of stock orders. Goldman didn\u2019t admit wrongdoing in the Finra case, but did in the SEC case.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jack Dorsey\u2019s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went South OpenAI's Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman's 33-Year-Old Lieutenant Inside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About Layoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren\u2019t Sacred Anymore\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Big news dropped last week that could point to the end of widespread trouble for\u00a0bank stocks. In a surprising move, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck upgraded all three of these bank stocks. She pointed specifically to the likelihood of buybacks accelerating this year, with increased IPO and M&A deal generation bumping bank stocks\u2019 collective bottom line.\n\nBank stocks tend to be a bellwether for more comprehensive economic conditions; the\u00a0Silicon Valley Bank collapse in 2023 was the first breaking point that indicated monetary tightening may have gone too far. Still, if bank stocks are in for the year Graseck expects, these three could top the charts soon \u2013 and offer wider solace to investors fearful of wide stock market struggles for the rest of 2024.\n\nBank Stocks: Bank of America (BAC) The logo of Bank of America (BAC) in modern office building in Beverly Hills, California\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen/Shutterstock\n\nGraseck bumped\u00a0Bank of America\u2019s (NYSE:BAC) price target to $41 from $32, indicating a hefty upside from today\u2019s pricing. Strong commercial and business banking growth, more than doubling its additions from the previous year, means bullish tailwinds swirling.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBank of America\u2019s investment banking segment strength further underscores the bank\u2019s operational stability. Hitting a\u00a07% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and outperforming the industry\u2014despite a general decline in the fee pool\u2014highlights its strategic and tactical resilience.\n\nOperational excellence is also evident in the bank stock\u2019s global banking expense management, nailing a 2% decrease in YoY expenses. That\u2019s commendable, considering higher capital costs and its ongoing expansion efforts. This disciplined approach to cost management, alongside strategic investments in global\u00a0transaction services and mid-market investment banking, suggests a forward-looking growth plan that doesn\u2019t sacrifice operational efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nBAC currently offers investors a\u00a04.55% total yield, accounting for buybacks.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is riding high on financial success while looking forward to renewed IPO opportunities that are its bread-and-butter. The bank stock\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings rekindled analyst confidence with an EPS of $5.48, significantly higher than the $3.62 consensus forecast. GS also posted a revenue beat to boot. The wealth management unit\u2019s contribution, which has substantially driven the bank\u2019s earnings, is particularly notable.\n\nThe\u00a051% surge in profits from the previous year marks a noteworthy turnaround, considering the bank\u2019s prior struggles, especially with its consumer banking ventures. But the best is yet to come as Goldman Sachs courts IPO hopefuls like Reddit. Renewed IPO enthusiasm is a major moneymaker for GS and could help offset higher capital costs that squeezed its bottom line in recent years. The bank stock already called for a revival for IPOs and deal-making in December, meaning they\u2019re positioned to race competitors as the playing field lights up.\n\nCitigroup (C) A Citibank (C) sign hangs on a Citibank office in Hong Kong. Citigroup layoffs\n\nSource: TungCheung / Shutterstock.com\n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) is one of the top income-producing bank stocks, generating a 5.13% total yield for investors despite past layoffs indicating uncertainty. But the overall overhaul may be just what Citigroup needed, considering it identified head executives and management among the headcount reduction. The judicious approach means that, like many companies, Citigroup recognized corporate bloat in the post-ZIRP era and took steps to right-size itself. While that isn\u2019t pleasant for those involved, a fact of life is that higher capital costs mean cost-cutting at home \u2013 and corporate bloat is easy fat to trim.\n\nThe company is also\u00a0right-sizing its operational approach, moving toward higher-paying clients and courting rich customers that otherwise went unnoticed by the bank stock. That renewed operational focus indicates that Citigroup\u2019s management is deliberately identifying what\u2019s gone wrong in recent years \u2013 and is taking definitive steps to address them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Is Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF (GLOV) a Strong ETF Right Now?",
        "content": "The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF (GLOV) made its debut on 03/15/2022, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the market.\n\nWhat Are Smart Beta ETFs?\n\nThe ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.\n\nA good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.\n\nHowever, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.\n\nNon-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.\n\nEven though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.\n\nFund Sponsor & Index\n\nThe fund is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds, and has been able to amass over $814.27 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the GOLDMAN SACHS ACTBT WORLD LW VL PL EQ ID.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity Index delivers exposure to large and mid-capitalization equity securities of developed market issuers, including the United States.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.\n\nIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 2.01%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nTaking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 3.31% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY).\n\nGLOV's top 10 holdings account for about 13.96% of its total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nSo far this year, GLOV has gained about 2.50%, and it's up approximately 15.30% in the last one year (as of 02/07/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $37.90 and $44.92.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.76 and standard deviation of 14.28% for the trailing three-year period. With about 391 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta World Low Vol Plus Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\n\nIShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $18.90 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $33.10 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "ETF Prime: Islam on the Magnificent Seven and More",
        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nOn this episode of ETF Prime, host Nate Geraci speaks with a trio of individuals discussing several different ETF-related topics. His guests include VettaFi\u2019s Roxanna Islam, who discusses the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d and more. Geraci also speaks with BondBloxx\u2019s Joanna Gallegos, who gives insight into the firm's fixed income ETFs. To close this week\u2019s podcast, Geraci brought on Goldman Sachs\u2019 Greg Tuorto, who shares information on the Goldman Sachs Small Cap Core Equity ETF (GSC), and small cap stocks.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\n\nTo open the podcast this week, Geraci brought on VettaFi\u2019s Roxanna Islam to discuss several topics surrounding the Magnificent Seven and their relevance in the markets today. The duo began their conversation by highlighting the significant weighting the seven stocks account for in the S&P 500, and the Q\u2019s. Geraci then asks Islam how she currently views the Magnificent Seven and if this type of strict concentration concerns her.\n\n\u201cThe Magnificent Seven isn\u2019t anything new at all, but I feel like all of a sudden I am hearing about this several times a day,\u201d she said.\n\nShe highlights that what is most attractive about these names is that they have provided growth while allowing investors to feel safe. Islam believes that this is an important trait to investors now, because of the present economic environment. She shares that although investors feel these names are attractive, she has seen some concern from them about what would happen if tech were to take a downturn. However, Islam believes the concern of a potential \u201ctech crash\u201d happening shouldn\u2019t be a problem for investors whose portfolios are fully diversified.\n\nThe Challenge of Trying to Diversify From the Mag 7\n\nGeraci then highlights the challenges some ETF-specific investors face when trying to diversify their portfolios from these seven stocks. He mentions that these companies can end up in several different funds depending on whether the ETF is focused on industries, areas, styles, or themes. Islam reiterates Geraci\u2019s point, and shares that she has seen that if funds focus on anything remotely close to disruptive tech, they will most likely include these seven stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at these disruptive tech innovation ETFs, you know a lot of the times you are in a new emerging industry,\" she said. \"And the issue with being in a new emerging industry is that many of the companies are private, and are not public yet.\u201d\n\nShe also mentions that if these funds hold other companies, they will be extremely small ones. The lack of companies available to these issuers who are following disruptive technologies is what leads many of them to include some of the Magnificent Seven in their holdings. The firms will do this because these businesses tend to somewhat follow the infrastructure of disruptive tech that they are looking to include in their funds. Islam feels the way investors can combat this problem is to pay attention to what is inside an ETF before investing in it, and look at how its holdings can help diversify their broader portfolios.\n\nIn addition, the duo explored ETFs that follow the Magnificent Seven, alternative ETF options, cryptocurrency, and more.\n\nBondBloxx and Fixed Income\n\nThe conversation shifted gears when Geraci brought on BondBloxx\u2019s Co-Founder Joanna Gallegos to discuss fixed income and her firm's ETFs. Before their discussion, he highlighted that the firm currently offers 23 ETFs, and has about $2.2 billion in assets under management in just under two years as a firm. The firm separates itself from others because it focuses solely on fixed income ETFs. Gallegos joined the conversation to share why her firm focuses solely on fixed income and the problem they were trying to solve when they began their journey.\n\n\u201cAround 2021, we anticipated that the bull market in fixed income would eventually change and that rates would eventually go up,\u201d she said.\n\nGallegos mentioned that she and the firm expected that once that happened, there\u2019d be a big structural shift in fixed income overall. She also said that the firm was anticipating a lot of new allocations coming to the fixed income space, because of the shift in the market. Gallegos shared that the growth they have seen thus far could be attributed to timing this shift well. However, she also feels that the firm is solving a problem in the market by offering unique fixed income products that hadn\u2019t previously been there for investors.\n\nAdditionally, the duo explored why BondBloxx\u2019s mission is resonating with investors and dove into the firm's unique lineup of fixed income ETFs.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Small Cap Core Equity ETF (GSC)\n\nTo close this week's podcast, Geraci brought on Goldman Sachs' Managing Director and Portfolio Manager Greg Tuorto to discuss small caps, and the Goldman Sachs Small Cap Core Equity ETF (GSC). Geraci highlighted that GSC was launched in October 2023, and is co-managed by Tuorto. Tuorto joined the discussion by sharing what his background is in, and what about small and midcaps excite him. Geraci then asked Tuorto how he is approaching managing GSC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bottom-up approach. That\u2019s one stock at a time that we use to kind of find the best ideas from our growth and our value teams within small caps,\u201d he said.\n\nTuoto also highlighted that most of the companies they hold within the fund are companies they have been familiar with and owned for a little bit of time before going into the GSC ETF. The fund will typically have less than 100 stocks, and Tuorto tries to avoid being sector-neutral to keep creativity in the fund-forming process. Furthermore, the pair continued to dive into the intricacies of the fund, as well as exploring the small cap space overall.\n\nListen to the entire episode of ETF Prime Featuring Roxanna Islam, Joanna Gallegos, and Greg Tuorto:\n\nFor more ETF Prime podcast episodes, visit our ETF Prime Channel.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\nSPY ETF Quote VOO ETF Quote QQQ ETF Quote VTI ETF Quote JNUG ETF Quote Top 34 Gold ETFs  Top 34 Oil ETFs  Top 57 Financials ETFs\n\nAmerican Beacon Launches Natural Resources ETF Countdown to Exchange: Re-Envision Wealth\u2019s Anna N\u2019Jie-Konte READ: Road to Exchange: Marguerita Cheng Artificial Intelligence Is the ETF Playoff Champion Countdown to Exchange: Dynasty\u2019s Andrew Marsh\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >",

        "title": "'Magnificent Seven' continued market dominance rests on sales growth, Goldman says",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong sales growth will be the key to whether the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of U.S. tech and growth stocks can continue outperforming following their explosive gains in 2023, Goldman Sachs equity strategists said.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla -- individually soared between around 50% and 240% in 2023, while collectively they accounted for over 60% of the S&P 500's total return last year.\n\nThe group is also outperforming so far this year, returning 7.9% vs. 2.6% for the remaining 493 stocks, Goldman's strategists led by David Kostin said in their weekly kickstart note.\n\nThe seven companies are expected to grow sales by a 12% average annual rate through 2026, against 3% for the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500, Goldman said, citing consensus estimates.\n\n\"While elevated hedge fund positioning, numerous antitrust lawsuits from the DoJ and the FTC, and shifts in the macro regime will influence returns for the stocks, we believe that sales growth for the seven stocks will be the most important driver of the group,\" the strategists said in the note.\n\nSince December 2019, the Magnificent Seven have collectively had a 28% annualized return, the bulk of which was driven by improving fundamentals as opposed to valuation expansion, according to Goldman.\n\nHigh valuations is the most common \"pushback\" Goldman hears from investors about the group.\n\nHowever, Goldman said, the Magnificent Seven's 63% price-to-earnings premium to the broader market is well below the peak 103% premium reached in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the group's \"quality attributes\" have helped insulate them from higher interest rates that have pressured other tech and growth stocks, Goldman said.\n\n\"The group outperformed in the high bond yield environment of the last 24 months in large part because of their strong balance sheets and elevated margins,\" the strategists said.\n\nSix of the seven companies have already reported results this period, with Nvidia set to report on Feb. 21.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

        "title": "The \u2018Future Is Bright\u2019 for These 2 Banking Stock Giants, Says Morgan Stanley",
        "content": "The banking crisis and recession of 2008 predictably led to tighter restrictions and regulations on the international banking industry \u2013 but a new note from Morgan Stanley\u2019s sector expert Betsy Graseck suggests that the most recent set of regulations, the Basel III endgame, may be eased in the near future.\n\nThe new rules derive from a set of regulations proposed last summer, imposing high levels of capital requirements on banks with $100 billion or more in total assets. Graseck, however, has been talking to management teams from the banking giants, and believes that the rules will not be as restrictive as had been previously assumed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re anticipating that a final rule set will better align with global standards, driving a lower risk-weighted assets uplift than banks originally disclosed,\u201d Graseck said, and she went on to point out that larger banks will see larger benefits, as they have more excess capital to set to work, once the lighter rules are in place. She expects to see a significant increase in buybacks as the banks start using that excess capital.\n\nZooming in, Graseck takes the time to give several major bank stocks a closer look in light of this development. She sees reason to upgrade several, believing the \u2018future is bright\u2019 for particular names in the space. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at two of her recent upgrades and with help from the TipRanks database, we can also gauge general Street sentiment toward these stocks.\n\nBank of America (BAC)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Bank of America, one of the world\u2019s largest banking firms. BofA boasts a market cap of $265 billion, and has approximately $3.18 trillion in total assets on the books. The bank is one of the top four in the US (alongside JPM, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup) and is ranked second by total domestic bank deposits. Bank of America has more than 3,900 retail banking locations, and some 16,000 ATMs.\n\nThe company released its 4Q23 and full-year 2023 results on January 12. The top line revenue figure for the quarter came to $22 billion, for a 10.5% year-over-year slip and missing expectations by $1.77 billion. For the year, revenue came to $98.6 billion, compared to $95 billion in 2022. At the bottom line, BoA reported an adjusted quarterly EPS of 70 cents per share, beating the forecast by 6 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf particular interest, in light of analyst Graseck\u2019s comments above on the banking sector generally, BofA has a long-held commitment to capital return. During the fourth quarter, the bank paid out $1.9 billion in dividends, and spent $800 million on share repurchases. The last dividend payment was declared on January 31, at 24 cents per share. The annualized payment of 96 cents gives a yield of 2.87%.\n\nFor Graseck, the important point on BAC is the relatively discounted price of the stock. She writes, \u201cWe are upgrading BAC primarily on valuation, as the stock is trading at only 9x our 2025 EPS, near the low end of its 8-15x average range over the last decade. We do not think a stock that can deliver 10% or more ROE should trade at an 11% cost of equity. Bank of America also benefits from a strong consumer deposit franchise, with 92% of consumer checking accounts being primary accounts and 67% of deposit balances being with customers that have been at BAC for more than 10 years.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, the Morgan Stanley analyst sees plenty of potential for Bank of America to hold the line in its business, and notes the bank\u2019s sound liquidity potential: \u201cIn our view, we see extraordinarily low risk BAC would have to tap unrealized losses in its HTM securities book given the strength, stickiness and diversity of its growing deposit franchise, ability to increase deposit rates to grow deposit balances if desired, extensive global liquidity sources of $897B, and daily LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) testing as a GSIB (global systemically important banks).\u201d\n\nAll of that makes a sound foundation for this bank, and supports Graseck\u2019s upgrade from Equal-weight (i.e., Neutral) to Overweight (Buy). Her price target on the shares, bumped up from $32 to $41, implies a one-year potential upside of 22.5%. (To watch Graseck\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe 19 recent analyst reviews on BAC break down to 11 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the shares. The stock is trading for $33.47 and its $37.36 average target price points toward a 12-month gain of 11.5%. (See BAC stock forecast)\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS)\n\nNext on our list is one of the best-known names in investment banking and financial services, Goldman Sachs. GS caters to a customer base made up of banks, corporations, financial institutions, governments and government agencies, and high-net-worth individuals, offering a full range of banking and credit services, including wealth and asset management and investment banking. Goldman is based in New York City, maintains offices in many of the world\u2019s iconic financial centers, and has been in operation for over 150 years.\n\nWith its lower Manhattan address and its well-heeled clientele, Goldman definitely occupies a high-prestige niche in the banking world. The bank\u2019s experts are well-known on Wall Street, and their views on the economy, the stock market, and the international financial scene are frequently in demand, making Goldman a leader in global investment research. GS has built up a market cap north of $126 billion, and as of December 31 last year had $1.642 trillion in total assets.\n\nGoldman isn\u2019t shy about returning capital to its investors. The bank reported its last set of financial results, for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, on January 16, and those results showed that, in 2023, the firm returned $9.39 billion worth of capital to common shareholders. This return included $5.8 billion in common stock repurchases, along with $3.59 billion in common share dividend payments. The most recent dividend, of $2.75, was declared for a March 28 payment. The dividend has an annualized rate of $11, and a forward yield of 2.84%.\n\nThat total capital return was based on the company\u2019s strong performance. Quarterly revenue came to $11.32 billion, up almost 7% y/y and some $360 million over the forecast. The bottom-line earnings, reported as $5.48 per share, were $1.55 per share better than had been anticipated.\n\nAnalyst Graseck notes that Goldman\u2019s current position makes it particularly suited to gain on a capital rebound, and writes at length to explain why, saying, \u201cGoldman is the most exposed in our Large Cap Banks coverage to a capital markets rebound, with 64% of revenues coming from Global Banking & Markets in 2024 in our model. We model Goldman\u2019s M&A advisory revenues increasing by 45% in 2024, ECM increasing 59% and DCM increasing 42%, a large percentage inflection off of a low base\u2026 We estimate $14B excess CET1 (1.9% of CET1 ratio) in scenario where Basel Endgame aligns with Europe, setting stage for a sharp uplift in net share buybacks from 1% of shares in 4Q23 ann. run rate to 7% of shares in \u201926.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Graseck uses these comments to back up her Equal-weight (Neutral) to Overweight (Buy) upgrade on GS shares. Her price target is now set at $449 (up from $333), implying a 16% upside on the one-year horizon.\n\nOverall, Goldman gets a Moderate Buy from the Street\u2019s consensus, based on 21 recent reviews that include 14 Buys to 7 Holds. Shares are trading for $387.86 and their $425.05 average price target suggests an increase of 9.5% in the next 12 months.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Goldman Sachs Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 41% of the company Insiders have been selling lately\n\nA look at the shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 66% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goldman Sachs Group.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Goldman Sachs Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Goldman Sachs Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Goldman Sachs Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.5% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs Group\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$637m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 33% stake in Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Goldman Sachs Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "11 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best American defense stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest events in the defense sector and the top weapons and firms, then you can take a look at the 5 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe defense industry, despite all the footage of F-16s firing missiles, is a rather less glamorous sector. Defense companies make all kinds of armaments and combat equipment, both lethal and non-lethal. From Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s fourth generation war fighters like the F-16, or Superior Group of Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGC)'s uniforms, each product plays a crucial role in sustaining a war machine regardless of whether there's peace or war.\n\nHowever, when it comes to talking about pure play defense stocks, these are firms that make weapons or provide direct services to the military. From bullets to missiles, defense stocks benefit from having a stable customer in the form of governments. So while firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are subject to the whims of their customers, others like The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) know that not only will they be required to service existing stockpiles, but also that a need to continuously keep themselves abreast of the latest developments in high technology industries such as materials science and aerospace engineering is indispensable.\n\nAfter a brief period of stability following America's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the world was plunged into war once again as Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, not only has the Ukraine invasion endured and seen the Eastern European nation take on one of the biggest militaries in the world, but conflict in the Middle East has also expanded. 2024 ushered in the first U.S. deaths in the Middle East since the attack on Israel.\n\nWhen we talk about defense stocks, one common claim is that as soon as there's a war in which their equipment might be involved (i.e. demand creation), the share prices of defense companies surge. (i.e. investors prepare for growth) For U.S. defense stocks, this claim stood the test of time at the onset of the Russian invasion. As an example, consider the shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), two of America's biggest nearly pure play defense stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the Russian invasion began on February 24th, 2022, Lockheed's shares surged by over 19% over the next two weeks before losing all their gains over the course of the next seven months. The stock roared back to life over the course of the next weeks, and since the start of hostilities and since Hamas's attack, the stock is up by 6%.\n\nSimilarly, Northrop's shares also surged during late February and in October after marking a 4% drop earlier this year in the wake of the company's earnings report. This report, which covered Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)'s earnings for the fourth quarter of and full year 2022 saw the American defense stock's earnings share and sales grow 25% and 16%, respectively. However, the stock fell as Wall Street was not impressed by a 30% net earnings drop for the full year.\n\nEven though they might experience some periodic turbulence, American defense stocks are nevertheless at the top of the global food chain. As an illustration, consider our coverage of the Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World. Within this list, out of the top five most valuable defense stocks, four were American. Along with Lockheed and Boeing, the top four defense stocks included the Charlotte, Carolina based industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) and missile manufacturer RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).\n\nBut what about Wall Street? After all, if investment banks and hedge funds are such savvy gurus, then they must possess some uncanny ability to 'sense' when an American defense stock's fortunes will rise. Well, we can see if investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was thinking ahead as it tinkered with its investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2023. We took a look at Goldman Sachs's defense and aerospace stock portfolio as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 10 Stock Picks.\n\nFor reference, during Q2 2023, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had marked its first anniversary and the Hamas attack was on the horizon. During this period, while Goldman Sachs's top five defense stock picks were all American defense stocks, the bank's favorite defense stock was Lockheed whose jets are so far unmatched globally in stealth technology. RTX (formerly Raytheon) and Boeing were the next two American defense stocks. When we analyze Goldman Sachs's stock portfolio for Q3 2023, we find that the bank trimmed its stake in Lockheed and RTX by 11% and in Boeing by 3%. All these American defense stocks were also present in our coverage of Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023, with Lockheed, RTX, Boeing, and General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) taking the first four places.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best American defense stocks to buy according to analysts. Some top analyst American top defense stock picks are Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL), and V2X, Inc. (NYSE:VVX). 11 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nSpaceKris/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best American defense stocks according to analysts, we ranked the 40 most valuable American aerospace and defense stocks by their average analyst share price upside and picked out the top stocks. The list was then further refined to remove those stocks that catered purely to civilian needs.\n\nFor these top American defense stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Asset management executive Julian Salisbury joined investment firm Sixth Street, and Dina Powell McCormick, the former head of Goldman's sovereign business, left for merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners.\n\n(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

        "content": "(Reuters) -Goldman Sachs is shuffling its management committee, in the latest indication of the power dynamics at the bank, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nFirm veterans Alison Mass and George Lee have left the group, which comprises the heads of the bank's main divisions and other top executives, the report said.\n\nGoldman is also creating two new committees to help oversee investment banking and markets, the Journal's report added.\n\nThe bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe Wall Street behemoth merged its banking and trading division in 2022, in a shakeup that eventually shifted its focus back to the traditional mainstays and away from an ill-fated foray into consumer banking.\n\nEarlier this week, Jim Esposito, co-head of Goldman Sachs' global banking and markets division, announced plans to retire after almost three decades at the bank.\n\nOther high-profile leaders have also left Goldman in recent months. Asset management executive Julian Salisbury joined investment firm Sixth Street, and Dina Powell McCormick, the former head of Goldman's sovereign business, left for merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners.\n\n(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday dismissed an appeal by investors who accused 10 of the world's largest banks of antitrust violations for conspiring to suppress competition in the now $26 trillion market for U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the 18 plaintiffs, including pension and retirement funds, did not plausibly allege that the banks violated the Sherman antitrust law by conspiring to rig Treasury auctions, or to boycott newer platforms for trading Treasuries.\n\nThe banks include Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, NatWest and UBS. Credit Suisse was also a defendant before UBS bought it last June.\n\nInvestors alleged that banks colluded from 2007 to 2015 to use chat rooms to swap confidential customer orders, and then exploiting their \"collective pool of knowledge\" to buy Treasuries at higher yields and lower prices.\n\nBank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were also accused of colluding to boycott electronic platforms that offered better prices and direct trading between buyside investors, known as \"all-to-all,\" to benefit their own platform.\n\nIn a 72-page decision, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said information shared on chatrooms was largely \"inconsequential market chatter,\" and the plaintiffs' statistical analyses didn't focus specifically on what the banks supposedly did wrong.\n\nJacobs called the boycott allegations even weaker. He said the plaintiffs' use of \"scattered\" data points over two decades, and claim that the banks threatened rival trading platforms, did not create an \"actionable conspiratorial narrative.\"\n\nLawyers for the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThursday's decision upheld a March 2022 ruling by U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case began in July 2015, following news reports that the U.S. Department of Justice was probing Treasury manipulation.\n\nBanks have separately paid billions of dollars in criminal and civil penalties to settle probes into the rigging of foreign currencies and the now-defunct interest rate benchmark Libor.\n\nThe case is In re: Treasury Securities Auction Antitrust Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-943.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York)",

        "title": "Is Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC) a Strong ETF Right Now?",
        "content": "Launched on 06/28/2017, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend category of the market.\n\nWhat Are Smart Beta ETFs?\n\nMarket cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.\n\nInvestors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.\n\nOn the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.\n\nNon-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.\n\nMethodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.\n\nFund Sponsor & Index\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $501.76 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Blend. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\n\nOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.37%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.\n\nRepresenting 19.70% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector; Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.\n\nWhen you look at individual holdings, Dec 23 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYZ3) accounts for about 2.07% of the fund's total assets, followed by Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) and Applied Industrial Technologies Inc (AIT).\n\nIts top 10 holdings account for approximately 5.59% of GSSC's total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nThe ETF has lost about -3.06% so far this year and is up roughly 4.53% in the last one year (as of 02/01/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $51.83 and $64.21.\n\nThe fund has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 21.74% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1318 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\n\nIShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) tracks Russell 2000 Index and the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) tracks S&P SmallCap 600 Index. IShares Russell 2000 ETF has $61.67 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF has $75.11 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Blend.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
