        "content": "Why Zillow (ZG) Stock Is Trading Up Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of online real estate marketplace Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) jumped 19.1% in the morning session after the company reported second quarter earnings results. Zillow blew past analysts' EPS expectations, and its revenue also outperformed Wall Street's estimates. There was broad-based strength across the company's segments, with rentals (an area of focus for investors) making encouraging strides. Zooming out, we think this was a good quarter, especially with skittishness around the health of the housing market due to higher interest rates than a few years ago.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zillow? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nZillow's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 19 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Zillow and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock dropped 9.4% on the news that the company reported first quarter results. Its EPS missed, and the number of website/mobile app visits fell short of Wall Street's projections. Additionally, revenue guidance for next quarter was below expectations, which is further driving weakness in the stock. On the other hand, Zillow exceeded analysts' revenue and EBITDA expectations this quarter. Overall, the results could have been better.\n\nZillow is down 14.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $48.16 per share it is trading 17.7% below its 52-week high of $58.51 from December 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Zillow's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,148.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "Zillow Group, Inc. ZG reported healthy second-quarter 2024 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed a revenue expansion year over year, backed by strong momentum in all verticals.\r\n\r\nThe company has a solid brand position in the residential real estate industry. It boasts 231 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites. Zillow\u2019s advanced technology, such as Real Time Touring, Listing Showcase, Follow Up Boss CRM and ShowingTime touring software, are gaining strong popularity among real estate agents. \r\n\r\nNet Income\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, net loss on a GAAP basis was $17 million or a loss of 7 cents per share compared with a net loss of $35 million or a loss of 15 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. \r\n\r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s net income was $99 million or a gain of 39 cents per share, identical to the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents.\n\nZillow Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zillow Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nZillow Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Zillow Group, Inc. Quote\n\nRevenues\r\n\r\nQuarterly net sales improved to $572 million from $506 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Healthy growth in the residential and rental segment boosted the top line. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $540 million. \r\n\r\nResidential revenues were $409 million, up 8% year over year from $380 million reported in the year-ago quarter, backed by solid growth in Premier Agent Business. Growth in the New Construction business, expansion of Listing Showcase nationwide through ShowingTime+ and contributions from Follow Up Boss also supported net sales in this vertical.\r\n\r\nRental revenues in the June quarter improved 29% year over year to $117 million. More signups for multi-family properties and greater single-family listings, along with enhancement in Zillow\u2019s Rentals marketplace to improve the renting experience, boosted revenues in this vertical.\r\n\r\nThe mortgages segment generated $34 million in revenues, up from $24 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by solid growth in purchase loan origination. However, the year-over-year increase in this segment was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage marketplace revenues.\r\n\r\nOther Details\r\n\r\nGross profit for the second quarter was $442 million compared with $402 million in the prior-year quarter, with respective margins of 77% and 79%. Operating expenses for the quarter were $480 million compared with the year-earlier quarter\u2019s tally of $469 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $134 million, up from $111 million in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher-than-expected Residential revenues.\r\n\r\nCash Flow & Liquidity\r\n\r\nZillow generated $135 million in cash from operating activities in the first six months of 2024 compared with $193 million in the prior-year period. As of Jun 30, 2024, the company had $1,181 million in cash and cash equivalents with $89 million of lease liabilities, net of current portion.\r\n\r\nOutlook\r\n\r\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Zillow expects total revenues in the range of $545-$560 million. Residential revenues are expected to be in the band of $375-$385 million. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $95 million-$110 million. Management expects double-digit revenue growth for 2024, with modest adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, primarily driven by the growth pillars.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank\n\nZillow Group currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nUpcoming Releases\r\n\r\nCogent Communications Holdings, Inc.

        "content": "Rich Barton and Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman (Zillow/Daniel Berman, Getty)\n\nWith a sixth consecutive quarterly loss in the books, Zillow is swapping out its CEO.\n\nRich Barton is stepping down as chief executive and being replaced by Zillow\u2019s chief operating officer, Jeremy Wacksman, the firm announced Wednesday.\n\nBarton will now join his co-founder, Lloyd Frink, as co-executive chair, and will advise Wacksman and other leaders at the company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m not doing anything else, but I\u2019m really excited to be moving to a role of coach and adviser rather than the field general,\u201d Barton said.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time Barton has stepped down as CEO. His first stint ended in 2010, six years after the company\u2019s founding. He began his second stint as chief executive in 2019 as the company built its iBuying business, which failed miserably and shuttered in 2021.\n\nWacksman joined Zillow from Microsoft in 2009 and has served in multiple roles across the company, including as chief marketing officer. He was promoted to chief operation officer three years ago.\n\n\u201cOftentimes when there\u2019s a leadership change, there\u2019s a \u2018what\u2019s going to change?\u2019 question. And the answer is, not much,\u201d Wacksman said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on continuing to actually deliver, scale and accelerate this into the future.\u201d\n\nNews of the shakeup came just an hour before Zillow discussed second-quarter results. The company logged another quarter without a profit, though it narrowed its losses from the previous year. Zillow lost $17 million last quarter, an improvement from $35 million of red ink in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nWacksman is taking the reins as low inventory of for-sale homes and higher mortgage rates continue to constrain the housing market.\n\nThe industry is also facing sweeping rule changes as part of the National Association of Realtors\u2019 nationwide antitrust settlement, though Zillow, which is not a party to the lawsuit, maintains that it\u2019s well positioned to weather the storm.\n\n\u201cWe, and our partners, are the outside beneficiaries of these changes,\u201d Wacksman said on the earnings call. \u201c\u200b\u200bWe think we will be caretakers in any future evolution or dispersion of the industry.\u201d\n\nThe settlement requires buyer\u2019s agents to obtain a signed agreement before bringing clients to tour a home. In response, Zillow launched a limited touring agreement earlier this year. The agreement allows agents to bring buyers to showings for seven days without an obligation to compensate them or work with them exclusively beyond the specified period.\n\nThe firm\u2019s adjusted EBITDA \u2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 was $134 million, up from $111 million in the same period last year. It also posted a 13 percent year-over-year increase in revenue \u2014 from $506 million to $572 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company attributed that growth in part to its rental segment. Revenue from rentals, which it said accounts for 20 percent of total revenue, grew nearly 30 percent last quarter. Zillow\u2019s active rental listings were up 16 percent year-over-year.\n\nThe company also reported a 42 percent annual increase in revenue from its mortgage arm.\n\nZillow\u2019s Flex program for agents, which urges participants to refer clients to the company\u2019s mortgage lending segment, is drawing scrutiny from competitors and industry experts, The Information reported on Wednesday.\n\nCritics told the publication that Zillow\u2019s tapping agents to build its mortgage business could run afoul of laws prohibiting lenders from giving kickbacks to agents for directing buyers to them.\n\nIn terms of digital traffic, Zillow remains firmly in the lead as Homes.com and Realtor.com duke it out. The company reported more than 230 million average monthly unique visitors across its websites and applications and claimed users rely on the Zillow app three times more than others in the same category.\n\nRead more\n\nZillow posts fifth consecutive quarterly loss Lawsuits, censures, insults: resi platform wars go from simmer to boil  Zillow\u2019s buyer agreements split brokers\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Real Deal.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Online real estate broker Zillow on Wednesday named insider Jeremy Wacksman as its chief executive officer, succeeding co-founder Rich Barton, who would become the co-executive chair.\n\nShares of the company jumped 11.5% in extended trading, after it also beat analysts' estimates for second-quarter profit and revenue.\n\nWacksman, a former Microsoft executive, joined Zillow in 2009 and had held product, marketing and operational responsibilities. He was most recently the company's chief operating officer.\n\nZillow said Barton would remain on the board of directors and become co-executive chair alongside co-founder and current executive chair Lloyd Frink.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I will remain engaged as my role shifts to counseling Jeremy and the leadership team, rather than daily operational leadership,\" Barton said in a letter to shareholders.\n\n\"We organized most of the company around Jeremy three years ago when we promoted him to chief operating officer,\" Barton added.\n\nAlso in the day, the Seattle-based company posted better-than-expected quarterly results as residential and rental revenue rose.\n\nIts second-quarter adjusted profit of 39 cents per share beat LSEG estimates of 27 cents per share.\n\nTotal revenue for the quarter ended June 30 was $572 million, up 13% from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $538.25 million.\n\nZillow also forecast its third-quarter revenue to be between $545 million and $560 million, the midpoint of which is roughly in line with analysts' estimate.\n\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

        "content": "Zillow Group (ZG) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.31 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 25.81%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online real estate marketplace would post earnings of $0.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.36, delivering no surprise.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nZillow , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $572 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.98%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $506 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nZillow shares have lost about 27.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Zillow?\n\nWhile Zillow has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Zillow: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Services is currently in the bottom 40% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nEventbrite (EB), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 8.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -100%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nEventbrite's revenues are expected to be $86.15 million, up 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Zillow's (NASDAQ:ZG) Q2: Strong Sales, Stock Jumps 12.5%\n\nOnline real estate marketplace Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) beat analysts' expectations in Q2 CY2024, with revenue up 13% year on year to $572 million. It made a GAAP loss of $0.07 per share, improving from its loss of $0.15 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zillow? Find out in our full research report.\n\nZillow (ZG) Q2 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $572 million vs analyst estimates of $538.2 million (6.3% beat) EPS: -$0.07 vs analyst estimates of -$0.16 ($0.08 beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 77.3%, down from 79.4% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 0%, down from 21.9% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$40.94 million, down from $41 million in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $9.95 billion\n\nFounded by Expedia co-founders Lloyd Frink and Rich Barton, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) is the leading U.S. online real estate marketplace.\n\nReal Estate Services\n\nTechnology has been a double-edged sword in real estate services. On the one hand, internet listings are effective at disseminating information far and wide, casting a wide net for buyers and sellers to increase the chances of transactions. On the other hand, digitization in the real estate market could potentially disintermediate key players like agents who use information asymmetries to their advantage.\n\nSales Growth\n\nReviewing a company's long-term performance can reveal insights into its business quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one tends to sustain growth for years. Over the last five years, Zillow grew its sales at a weak 3.3% compounded annual growth rate. This shows it failed to expand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Zillow Total Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. Zillow's history shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 56.4% annually.\n\nThis quarter, Zillow reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 13%, and its $572 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 6.3%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 11.1% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nStory continues\n\nCash Is King\n\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nZillow has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company's free cash flow margin averaged 10.4% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer discretionary sector. Zillow Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nZillow burned through $40.94 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 7.2% margin. The company's quarterly cash flow turned negative after being positive in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren't a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we'll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters.\n\nKey Takeaways from Zillow's Q2 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly Zillow blew past analysts' EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a good quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 12.5% to $45.40 immediately after reporting.\n\nZillow may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "SEATTLE, Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z and ZG), which is transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes, today announced its consolidated financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Zillow Group logo, April 2019 (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nComplete financial results for the second quarter and outlook for the third quarter of 2024 can be found in our shareholder letter on the Investor Relations section of Zillow Group's website at https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx.\n\n\"Zillow outperformed the residential real estate industry for the eighth consecutive quarter, delivering better-than-expected revenue across the business,\" said Zillow Group CEO Jeremy Wacksman. \"We're executing well, continually shipping exceptional products and services in Zillow's housing super app as we build the digital future of real estate. With an increasingly diversified and growing business, we are on our way to deliver strong GAAP profitability over time and meet our 2024 expectations to deliver double-digit revenue growth and modestly expand our Adjusted EBITDA margin. We are well positioned to capture more of our total addressable market and help more people get home.\"\n\nRecent highlights include:\n\nZillow Group's second-quarter results exceeded the company's outlook for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.  Q2 revenue was $572 million, up 13% year over year and above the midpoint of the company's outlook range by $39 million.\n\nResidential revenue was up 8% year over year in Q2 to $409 million, outperforming both the residential real estate industry total transaction value1 growth of 3% and the company's outlook.  Rentals revenue of $117 million increased 29% year over year, primarily driven by multifamily revenue growing 44% year over year in Q2.  Mortgages revenue of $34 million increased 42% year over year, due primarily to a 125% year-over-year increase in purchase loan origination volume to $756 million in Q2. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage marketplace revenue.  On a GAAP basis, net loss was $17 million, or 3% of total revenue, in Q2.  Q2 Adjusted EBITDA was $134 million, or 23% of total revenue, $41 million above the midpoint of the company's outlook range, driven primarily by higher-than-expected Residential revenue.  Cash and investments at the end of Q2 were $2.6 billion, down from $2.9 billion at the end of Q1 2024.  Traffic to Zillow Group's mobile apps and sites in Q2 was 231 million average monthly unique users, flat year over year. Visits during Q2 were 2.5 billion, up 4% year over year.  Today, we announced Jeremy Wacksman has been promoted to chief executive officer of Zillow Group and appointed to the company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\").

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted GAAP net income (loss) to forecasted Adjusted EBITDA within this press release because we are unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to calculate certain reconciling items with confidence. These items include but are not limited to: income taxes that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of the company's capital stock; depreciation and amortization from new acquisitions; impairments of assets; gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; and acquisition-related costs. These items, which could materially affect the computation of forward-looking GAAP net income (loss), are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are outside of our control. We have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income (loss) margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the same reasons.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\n\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;  Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;  Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect loss on extinguishment of debt;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;  Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and  Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash-flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods presented (in millions, unaudited):\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nJune 30, Six Months Ended\r\nJune 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss: Net loss $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (17) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (35) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (40) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (57) Income taxes 2 1 4 1 Other income, net (34) (42) (67) (74) Depreciation and amortization 59 45 115 85 Share-based compensation 113 130 221 233 Impairment and restructuring costs \u2014 2 6 8 Acquisition-related costs \u2014 1 \u2014 1 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1 \u2014 1 \u2014 Interest expense 10 9 19 18 Adjusted EBITDA $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 134 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 111 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 259 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 215 Cision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-group-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-302217042.html\n\nSOURCE Zillow Group, Inc.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Rich Barton remains on the Zillow Group Board of Directors and becomes co-executive chair alongside Zillow co-founder and current executive chair Lloyd Frink\n\nSEATTLE, Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Zillow Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: Z and ZG), which is transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes, today announced longtime executive and Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Wacksman has been promoted to chief executive officer and appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. Wacksman succeeds co-founder Rich Barton, who remains on the Zillow Group Board of Directors and becomes co-executive chair alongside Zillow co-founder and current Executive Chair Lloyd Frink. Zillow Group logo, April 2019 (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nWacksman joined Zillow from Microsoft in 2009 and has earned multiple promotions throughout his 15 years at Zillow, including as a product leader, chief marketing officer (CMO) and, for the past three years, as chief operating officer (COO), with responsibility for growing Zillow Group businesses and also overseeing engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and industry relations.\n\n\"Zillow's business is firing on all cylinders and performing well through a challenging real estate macro. We've built and integrated products, completed strategic acquisitions, enhanced our agent partner network, and leaned in hard on our Mortgages and Rentals businesses,\" Barton said. \"This is due in no small part to the leadership of Jeremy Wacksman, with the past three years being a time of particularly impressive innovation for the company. Lloyd and I could not be more confident in Jeremy as CEO, in the caliber of the broader team and in Zillow's bright future.\"\n\nDuring his leadership tenure at Zillow, Wacksman has been a driver of innovation in real estate. As a Zillow product leader, Wacksman helped pioneer mobile real estate shopping and, today, Zillow Group apps have three times more daily active users than any other company in the category. As CMO, Wacksman shepherded the pivotal product and consumer marketing strategy that helped Zillow grow into the household brand it is today, with 231 million average monthly unique users and the word \"Zillow\" searched more than the term \"real estate.\" When Barton tapped him as COO, Wacksman operationalized Zillow's housing super app strategy while maintaining strong cost discipline, diversifying revenue streams, growing the Rentals and Mortgages businesses, and successfully acquiring industry software solutions like Follow Up Boss and ShowingTime. He also organized and elevated the talent that now makes up Zillow's world-class product, engineering and design organizations responsible for innovative product rollouts such as 3D interactive floor plans, Real Time Touring and Zillow Showcase.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"With the strength of Zillow's brand, our highly engaged audience and a steadily growing business portfolio, we are in a great position to capture meaningful transaction share for years to come,\" Wacksman said. \"The work we're doing to bring the integrated transaction to life through exceptional tech solutions for consumers and agents will transform residential real estate. I love this company and its mission, and I am honored to lead our extraordinary team into the next phase of Zillow's growth.\"\n\nBoth Barton and Frink have led the Board of Directors and held Board positions, including the chairmanship, since they founded Zillow in 2004. They will continue to be active in the Company to support Wacksman and the leadership team.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\r\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, statements regarding Zillow Group's business growth, performance, and impact on residential real estate.\u00a0Statements containing words such as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"predict,\" \"will,\" \"projections,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"outlook,\" \"guidance,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"strive,\" or similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements.

        "content": "Zillow (ZG) Reports Earnings Tomorrow: What To Expect\n\nOnline real estate marketplace Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) will be reporting earnings tomorrow after market close. Here's what to expect.\n\nZillow beat analysts' revenue expectations by 4.1% last quarter, reporting revenues of $529 million, up 12.8% year on year. It was a weaker quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' earnings and monthly active users estimates.\n\nIs Zillow a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Zillow's revenue to grow 6.4% year on year to $538.2 million, a reversal from the 49.9% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.30 per share. Zillow Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Zillow has a history of exceeding Wall Street's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 5.3% on average.\n\nLooking at Zillow's peers in the real estate services segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Newmark delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 8.1%, meeting analysts' expectations, and Compass reported revenues up 13.8%, topping estimates by 3.3%. Newmark traded down 9.5% following the results while Compass was also down 3.4%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Newmark's results here and Compass's results here.\n\nInvestors in the real estate services segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices flat over the last month. Zillow is down 6.3% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $53.3 (compared to the current share price of $42.47).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "title": "What homebuyers and sellers need to know as seismic changes take hold",
        "content": "Big changes take effect this month that will mean seismic shifts in how most Americans buy or sell a home and could ultimately drive down residential real estate prices.\n\nStarting on Aug. 17, agents who list homes for sellers on widely used realtor databases won\u2019t be able to offer any payments to buyers' agents.\n\nThat means the power to negotiate realtor commissions will shift away from agents in favor of buyers and sellers.\n\nIt also means sellers will no longer be on the hook to fund commissions for all realtors involved in the transaction \u2014 a fee that usually amounts to 5% to 6% of the home\u2019s sales price. The seller\u2019s agent commonly shared roughly half of that commission with the buyer's agent.\n\nInstead, buyers will be entitled to separately negotiate their own agent's pay and get a signed contract formalizing the terms \u2014 all before touring any properties for sale.\n\n\"Under the old system, if you were a buyer and you had an agent, you didn't get any say in what your agent got paid, unless your agent agreed to credit some of that to your purchase price,\" said Venable LLP partner Jill Rowe, who represents real estate brokers and owners.\n\nThe new terms are far-reaching because they apply to properties listed on Multiple Listing Services (MLSs), databases controlled by the National Association of Realtors that host more than 90% of all US home sales.\n\nThese changes are designed to eliminate conflicts of interest in the real estate industry and make the process friendlier for consumers.\n\nThey could drive down real estate commissions and home prices, some said, while transitioning the business of real estate services to more of an \u00e0 la carte industry.\n\nThe new rules came about as a result of a class-action lawsuit from home sellers who argued the old fee-splitting structure was unfair.\n\nThe core of their argument was that the old structure artificially fixed commission rates and influenced agents to steer clients to homes that paid higher commissions. That, in turn, inflated home prices. A for sale sign stands outside a single-family home in Englewood, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe new rules were agreed to as part of a $418 million settlement with the National Association of Realtors and several large real estate firms last March, ending the first in a string of similar cases to go to trial.\n\nHere is a closer look at what buyers and sellers now need to know:\n\n'What kind of commission am I paying?'\n\nIt will require some homework and patience to understand your rights and obligations under the new system and benefit from the new arrangement.\n\nThe \"big change,\" according to Rowe, is that agents who list homes for sellers on MLS databases won\u2019t be able to offer any payments to buyer's agents \u2014 as was the practice for decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other significant change is that agents representing buyers will no longer be allowed to take a prospective client to tour any properties without first obtaining written consent about the fees and commissions that the client will have to pay.\n\nAll of these details can be negotiated by the buyer. The contract must explain if the agent\u2019s compensation will be calculated as a flat fee, as a percentage of the home\u2019s purchase price, as an hourly rate, or otherwise.\n\nAnd under no circumstances can that agent's commission be open-ended or dictated by a seller\u2019s agent. An aerial view of homes in a housing development in Santa Clarita, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) (Mario Tama via Getty Images)\n\nPlus, agents must disclose that their commissions are fully negotiable and not set by law.\n\n\"If I were a buyer or seller of a residential property right now, what I would say to my broker is: What kind of commission am I paying?\" Rowe said. \"What am I getting for that? And what would I get if I had a 1% lower commission, or a 2% lower commission?\"\n\nJennifer Stevenson, a New York State Realtor and NAR regional vice president, said in the past agents could also use listings to offer compensation to other seller's agents and to cooperating brokers.\n\n\"Now we'll no longer be able to do that,\" Stevenson said.\n\nShe noted that buyers and sellers were always permitted to negotiate commissions with agents and that under the new rules listing agents will still be allowed to negotiate commission splits, but only outside of the MLS.\n\nA 'different value proposition'\n\nThe ultimate effect on the residential real estate industry is not yet known, although some certainly expect commissions, and even home prices, to fall.\n\nAt minimum, it's expected to place more power in the hands of clients, especially those already using residential real estate platforms like Zillow (Z), Redfin (RDFN), Realtor.com, and Trulia, to find homes and home details posted on MLS databases. An iPhone showing the Zillow app. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) (Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images)\n\nThese platforms had already been disrupting the residential real estate industry by allowing sellers and buyers to efficiently search for information that only relators using MLSs once provided.\n\n\"You can just go online, and you can see everything that is available ... what its price is, all of the different terms, look at the neighborhood, and see pictures of what it looks like,\" Rowe said.\n\nThat technology has tremendously reduced the amount of time that agents, and particularly buyer's agents, spend on behalf of their clients.\n\n\"Quite often, the buyers are finding something online and saying, 'I want to take a look at that,' and either going by themselves to the open house, or having their agents call the seller's agent and arrange a look,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"So it's just a different value proposition.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Where Starter Homes Begin At A Cool $1 Million\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWhile the median existing home price hit an all-time high of $426,900 in June, up 4.1% from $410,100 a year ago, it hardly seems like things can get more challenging for the aspiring homebuyer. As prices have risen, home sales have sunk due to prices and stubborn mortgage rates that have caused the cost of buying a home to soar.\n\nA new Zillow study says the market is even more restrictive in over 200 cities. The report found that in 237 cities across the United States, a starter home will cost $1 million or more. That\u2019s up 182% in just five years when there were 84 cities with a starting price of $1 million.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nFind out how you compare to the average American couple\u2019s retirement balance \u2014 will you make the $1,000,000 mark? With returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\n\nZillow defined a starter home as being in the lowest third of home values in a given region. It calculated that nationally, a typical starter home is worth $196,611. That\u2019s far below the median price of existing homes and affordable for many people in the United States, but it has increased by over 54% in the last five years. Homebuying is delayed or simply out of reach as prices rise for many people. Zillow reported that a median-income household would have to put down $127,000 on a typical U.S. home.\n\nThe Golden State isn\u2019t looking so great for buyers. Zillow found that while half of all states have at least one city with starter homes cresting the $1 million mark, California has 117 of them. Zillow found that the average California home value is $786,730, up 6.8% over the past year. There are over 74,005 homes in the state, and the median sale price as of May was $736,500. With 51.9% of sales completed over the list price, it seems that high prices aren\u2019t entirely chasing off prospective buyers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nThe other top states with cities with $1 million starter homes included New York, which had 31, and New Jersey, with 21. Florida and Massachusetts had 11 each. The study also found that in some areas, million-dollar cities cluster together. The larger New York City metropolitan area had 48 of these cities, besting San Francisco, which came in with 44.\n\nThe question on most people's minds is how much longer this can last. There are some signs that the market may be starting to shift. Speaking with CNBC last month, National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said that he's starting to see inventory rise. That's borne out by a Redfin report that found that nearly two-thirds of homes on the market in June sat on the market for over 30 days. \"As we get more inventory, home prices will stop accelerating,\" said Yun. \"I think there will be slight growth but not strong growth, and we certainly need more stabilizing home prices.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBuyers may be adjusting to the sticker shock of high mortgage rates, and if home prices stop accelerating, this could mean increased buying. However, those hoping that mortgage rates might drift down to the sub-5% number buyers enjoyed a few years ago may well be disappointed. Yun called 6% the new normal, a number below the current average. It will take some time for inventory increases to have an effect on housing prices, so those in those $1 million starter home markets may need to practice patience or look elsewhere.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "Zillow Reports Starter Homes Hit $1 Million Mark In 237 Cities\n\nGone are the days when $1 million bought luxury living.\n\nAccording to a Zillow analysis, that price tag is the new normal for a starter home in 237 U.S. cities. This is a mind-boggling shift from just five years ago when only 84 cities commanded a hefty price tag for a basic dwelling.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Will the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nThe culprit behind the dramatic increase is a perfect storm of factors, primarily a severe housing shortage that's been intensifying since the pandemic. While the typical U.S. home price has skyrocketed by nearly 50% in the past five years, starter homes have seen an even more alarming surge of 54.1%.\n\nThis unprecedented affordability crisis has a ripple effect, delaying homeownership dreams for countless people. The average age of first-time homebuyers has climbed to 35, a full year older than in 2019. This reality underscores the challenges facing young adults eager to step onto the property ladder.\n\nTrending:Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate \u2014 This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\n\"Homebuyers are battling affordability and availability today \u2013 so much so that $1 million is the norm for a starter home in hundreds of cities,\" Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy said. \"However, it's looking more and more like there will be some good news ahead for first-time buyers. More homes are for sale, price cuts are on the rise, and buyers have a few more days to weigh their options as homes sit on the market.\"\n\nHalf of all U.S. states now boast at least one city where the typical starter home costs $1 million or more. California reigns supreme with 117 cities in that category, far outpacing New York and New Jersey, which have 31 and 21 cities with million-dollar-plus starter homes, respectively. Florida and Massachusetts tie for the fifth spot with 11 cities each where the typical starter home costs at least $1 million.\n\nSee Also: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nThe California Association of Realtors reported that the median home price in the state skyrocketed to $904,210 in April, an 11.4% increase compared to last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMajor metropolitan areas like New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles lead the pack in terms of million-dollar starter homes. However, these cities, along with others facing restrictive building regulations, have seen homeownership rates decline.\n\nThe Zillow study emphasizes the need for more homes.

        "content": "Listings for luxury homes are seeing relatively more competition than homes in the market's midrange\n\nLuxury home values are up 3.9% year over year. Inventory of luxury homes remains 46.9% below pre-pandemic levels, a bigger deficit than in the housing market overall. Richmond has the hottest luxury housing market in the country. Austin is the only major market where luxury home values have declined throughout the past year.\n\nSEATTLE, July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Luxury home value growth, which has consistently lagged the market's middle tier over the past several years, has now outpaced appreciation on typical homes for five consecutive months, a new Zillow\u00ae analysis shows. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nThe typical luxury home nationwide \u2014 defined for this analysis as the most valuable 5% of homes in a given region \u2014 is worth about $1,620,000. Among the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, the typical luxury home ranges from a low of just under $750,000 in Buffalo to more than $5.3 million in San Jose.\n\nLuxury home values across the U.S. are 3.9% higher than a year ago. That's faster appreciation than the 3.2% annual growth for the typical U.S. home. For every month from January 2019 \u2014 the earliest year-over-year change in Zillow's records \u2014 through January 2024, typical home values were outpacing luxury homes on an annual basis. For every month since, luxury home values have been growing faster.\n\n\"Luxury homes can be challenging to sell because the pool of buyers is so much smaller. That's one reason prices for them usually grow more slowly,\" said Anushna Prakash, economic research scientist at Zillow. \"We're seeing a different trend play out this year. Luxury home buyers are likely less affected by higher mortgage rates than a typical buyer, especially repeat buyers who saw their home equity soar over recent years. Many will be able to pay with cash and skip a mortgage payment altogether.\"\n\nLuxury home inventory has been slower to recover than inventory overall, helping to keep prices climbing. Inventory in the luxury segment is up 15.7% year over year and is 46.9% below pre-pandemic norms. By comparison, total inventory is 22.7% higher than last year and about 32.6% below pre-pandemic averages.\n\nThe share of luxury listings with a price cut is climbing, but is tracking below the market as a whole. In June, 20.8% of luxury listings experienced a price cut, up from 19.4% the previous June. Among all homes, 24.5% of listings had a price cut.\n\nThe luxury home market in Richmond is red hot, with values 16.5% higher than last year, far surpassing the growth seen in any other major market. Hartford luxury homes had the next strongest growth, up 8.6% over the same period. Luxury home inventory in Richmond is down 13.2% year over year, making it one of only six major markets with fewer luxury homes for sale than last year. Luxury homes in Richmond that sold in June did so after just six days on the market, the fastest rate in the country.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustin is the only major market where luxury home values declined over the past year, down 1.5%. Home values in Austin overall saw a meteoric rise during the pandemic, and a building boom in response to that demand has helped lessen competition for each home and bring price growth under control.\n\nMetro Area Typical Luxury\r\nHome Value Luxury Home\r\nValue Change\r\nYear over Year \r\n(YoY) Luxury For-Sale\r\nInventory \r\nChange (YoY) Share of\r\nLuxury \r\nListings with\r\na Price Cut Median Days\r\nto Pending for\r\nLuxury Listings United States $1,619,685 3.9\u00a0% 15.7\u00a0% 1.4\u00a0% 24 New York, NY $3,483,722 2.2\u00a0% -4.4\u00a0% 0.5\u00a0% 57 Los Angeles,\r\nCA $4,642,958 3.5\u00a0% 35.5\u00a0% 2.1\u00a0% 31 Chicago, IL $1,343,781 5.6\u00a0% 0.5\u00a0% -0.4\u00a0% 13 Dallas, TX $1,635,382 5.3\u00a0% 32.6\u00a0% 5.4\u00a0% 22 Houston, TX $1,415,411 4.8\u00a0% 0.0\u00a0% 2.1\u00a0% 23 Washington,\r\nDC $2,029,263 3.4\u00a0% 11.3\u00a0% -3.5\u00a0% 11 Philadelphia,\r\nPA $1,269,418 4.6\u00a0% 14.4\u00a0% 2.2\u00a0% 8 Miami, FL $4,077,925 2.9\u00a0% 15.0\u00a0% 1.4\u00a0% 83 Atlanta, GA $1,457,787 5.0\u00a0% 16.8\u00a0% 1.4\u00a0% 23 Boston, MA $2,698,471 5.8\u00a0% 13.7\u00a0% -0.7\u00a0% 17 Phoenix, AZ $2,037,033 7.1\u00a0% 19.1\u00a0% 6.2\u00a0% 39 San\r\nFrancisco, CA $4,298,273 1.1\u00a0% -4.0\u00a0% -1.0\u00a0% 16 Riverside, CA $1,692,781 4.6\u00a0% 21.8\u00a0% -0.5\u00a0% 35 Detroit, MI $903,679 3.7\u00a0% 11.0\u00a0% 0.6\u00a0% 7 Seattle, WA $2,927,108 4.5\u00a0% 3.2\u00a0% 0.3\u00a0% 9 Minneapolis,\r\nMN $1,188,521 0.9\u00a0% 15.9\u00a0% 2.3\u00a0% 26 San Diego, CA $3,799,265 5.9\u00a0% 17.3\u00a0% -2.7\u00a0% 24 Tampa, FL $1,639,706 2.7\u00a0% 80.4\u00a0% 0.0\u00a0% 38 Denver, CO $1,991,133 1.1\u00a0% 11.6\u00a0% 2.9\u00a0% 17 Baltimore,\r\nMD $1,329,549 4.6\u00a0% 13.3\u00a0% 0.5\u00a0% 8 St. Louis, MO $1,002,017 4.8\u00a0% 8.5\u00a0% 1.5\u00a0% 7 Orlando, FL $1,425,759 4.7\u00a0% 43.2\u00a0% 1.0\u00a0% 30 Charlotte, NC $1,607,506 7.9\u00a0% 21.2\u00a0% 5.6\u00a0% 22 San Antonio,\r\nTX $1,158,841 1.0\u00a0% 19.6\u00a0% 0.0\u00a0% 33 Portland, OR $1,506,635 0.4\u00a0% 19.3\u00a0% -2.1\u00a0% 20 Sacramento,\r\nCA $1,794,005 2.1\u00a0% 17.0\u00a0% -0.5\u00a0% 18 Pittsburgh,\r\nPA $839,418 5.2\u00a0% 1.4\u00a0% 3.8\u00a0% 11 Cincinnati,\r\nOH $949,801 5.3\u00a0% 6.5\u00a0% -0.8\u00a0% 7 Austin, TX $2,106,787 -1.5\u00a0% 24.7\u00a0% 1.9\u00a0% 68 Las Vegas, NV $1,587,199 7.5\u00a0% 0.2\u00a0% 1.7\u00a0% 42 Kansas City,\r\nMO $1,041,851 4.4\u00a0% 15.9\u00a0% 3.5\u00a0% 8 Columbus,\r\nOH $1,014,617 4.4\u00a0% 26.8\u00a0% 1.1\u00a0% 10 Indianapolis,\r\nIN $988,246 3.2\u00a0% 12.8\u00a0% -2.9\u00a0% 9 Cleveland, OH $810,190 7.1\u00a0% -4.5\u00a0% 2.3\u00a0% 8 San Jose, CA $5,330,815 6.4\u00a0% 19.1\u00a0% -4.7\u00a0% 10 Nashville, TN $2,113,255 3.1\u00a0% 12.1\u00a0% 2.1\u00a0% 35 Virginia\r\nBeach, VA $1,227,058 5.6\u00a0% 10.1\u00a0% -2.3\u00a0% 32 Providence,\r\nRI $1,861,985 7.8\u00a0% 30.5\u00a0% 2.6\u00a0% 20 Jacksonville,\r\nFL $1,646,706 4.3\u00a0% 36.5\u00a0% 5.9\u00a0% 44 Milwaukee,\r\nWI $1,234,835 5.5\u00a0% -19.5\u00a0% -3.5\u00a0% 24 Oklahoma\r\nCity, OK $847,637 1.7\u00a0% 24.4\u00a0% 4.5\u00a0% 34 Raleigh, NC $1,489,123 6.9\u00a0% 38.0\u00a0% -1.1\u00a0% 9 Memphis, TN $860,564 2.2\u00a0% 41.5\u00a0% 0.6\u00a0% 40 Richmond, VA $1,152,228 16.5\u00a0% -13.2\u00a0% 1.8\u00a0% 6 Louisville, KY $848,250 2.6\u00a0% 43.5\u00a0% -1.0\u00a0% 9 New Orleans,\r\nLA $1,033,156 0.0\u00a0% 17.3\u00a0% 1.1\u00a0% 42 Salt Lake City,\r\nUT $1,600,130 4.0\u00a0% 34.2\u00a0% 0.1\u00a0% 20 Hartford, CT $1,004,138 8.6\u00a0% 3.0\u00a0% 2.5\u00a0% 7 Buffalo, NY $748,623 4.9\u00a0% -5.4\u00a0% 0.7\u00a0% 11 Birmingham,\r\nAL $1,124,634 4.0\u00a0% 19.3\u00a0% 1.2\u00a0% 13 *Table ordered by market size\n\nAbout\u00a0Zillow Group\n\nZillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "A starter home used to be considered a smaller, but more affordable option for young families and other first-time buyers looking to enter the real estate market.\n\nThat may no longer be the case.\n\nThese days, the typical starter home is worth at least $1 million in 237 cities, the most ever, according to new findings published by Zillow. Five years ago, just 84 cities met that criteria. Zillow defines a starter home as being among those in the lowest third of home values in a given region.\n\nTHE US HOUSING MARKET IS 'STUCK,' AND MIGHT REMAIN THAT WAY UNTIL 2026\n\nNationwide, a starter home is worth about $196,611, which is \"comfortably affordable\" for a median-income household. But starter home values have surged 54.1% over the past five years, faster than the 49.1% increase seen for the average U.S. home during that same time frame. Homes in Hercules, California, on Aug. 16, 2023.\n\nHalf of all U.S. states have at least one city where the typical starter home costs at least $1 million. But more than half of those cities are located in California, where starter homes would cost buyers $1 million in 117 cities. New York came in second, with 31 cities, followed by New Jersey with 21. Florida and Massachusetts rounded out the top five, with 11 cities each.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThere are a number of driving forces behind the affordability crisis.\n\nMORTGAGE CALCULATOR: SEE HOW MUCH HIGHER RATES COULD COST YOU\n\nYears of underbuilding fueled a shortage of homes in the country, a problem that was later exacerbated by the rapid rise in mortgage rates and expensive construction materials.\n\nHigher mortgage rates over the past three years have also created a \"golden handcuff\" effect in the housing market. Sellers who locked in a record-low mortgage rate of 3% or less during the pandemic began have been reluctant to sell, limiting supply further and leaving few options for eager would-be buyers. Homes in Centreville, Maryland, on April 4, 2023.\n\nEconomists predict that mortgage rates will remain elevated for most of 2024 and that they will only begin to fall once the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates. Even then, rates are unlikely to return to the lows seen during the pandemic, with investors predicting just one or two rate reductions this year.\n\nMortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year loan this week inched higher to 6.78%. While that is down from a peak of 7.79% last fall, it remains sharply higher than the pandemic-era lows of just 3%.\n\nMost homeowners say they are nearly twice as willing to sell their home if their mortgage rate is 5% or higher, according to a Zillow survey. Currently, about 80% of mortgage holders have a rate below 5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOriginal article source:A $1 million starter home is the new normal in over 200 cities\n\nView comments",

        "title": "$1 million starter homes are more common than ever",
        "content": "The housing market's affordability crisis keeps setting dubious milestones, and that latest one adds to the woes that first-time homebuyers are facing.\n\nAccording to a Zillow report on Thursday, the typical starter home, which is defined as a house in the lowest third of values in a given region, is worth at least $1 million in a record-high 237 cities. That's nearly triple the pre-pandemic level of 84 such cities in 2019.\n\nThe housing market's lock-in effect, where Fed rate hikes and subsequent high mortgage rates discouraged homeowners from moving, has kept inventory low.\n\nIn addition to weak supply, demand has remained high, lifting home prices and putting more options out of reach for prospective buyers.\n\nBut the good news for first-time buyers is that most of the cities where $1 million starter homes are the norm are concentrated in a handful of states, according to Zillow.\n\nWhile half of all states have at least one city with $1 million starter homes, nearly half of the national total are located in California, which has 117 such cities. New York is next with 31, followed by New Jersey with 21, with Florida and Massachusetts each having 11.\n\n\"Metros with the most-restrictive building regulations tend to have the largest number of cities with $1 million starter homes,\" Zillow said. \"They are also markets with lower homeownership rates.\"\n\nNationwide, the typical starter home is worth $196,611, up 54.1% over the past five years, according to the report. That outpaces the 49% increase for homes overall during that time.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier Zillow data showed that homebuyers now need a 35% downpayment to afford a typical home, instead of the traditional 20%. And the number of cities where the median-priced home is at least $1 million shot up to 550 from 491 last year.\n\nBut there have been some signs that the housing market is shifting more in favor of buyers. Mortgage rates have dipped on expectations of Fed rate cuts later this year, more listings have come into the market, and builders are also adding to inventory. Prospective homebuyers are even backing out of deals at a record pace.\n\n\"With more homes for-sale, buyers have more time to weigh their options,\" Zillow said on Thursday. \"Rising housing inventory is also helping the negotiating power swing in buyers\u2019 favor as price cuts are at record highs for this time of year.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Zillow Found That 8 Million Renters Would've Spent 30% Less Of their Total Income On Mortgage Payments If They Knew They Were 'Mortgage-Ready'\n\nA surprising number of renters could afford to buy a home, according to a new Zillow Analysis.\n\nDespite 39% of U.S. families renting in 2022, nearly 8 million qualified as \"income mortgage-ready.\" This means they could likely handle a mortgage payment for a typical home in their area without exceeding 30% of their income.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nWhile some people prefer renting, Zillow economist Orphe Divounguy suggests that many potential homeowners may simply be unaware of their financial ability to purchase a home.\n\n\"If your lease is about to end, it might be wise to determine whether you're in a position to buy a house,\" Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage, told CNBC.\n\nTo understand your homebuying potential, Cohn recommends starting with a lender\u2019s verbal prequalification. This initial step can determine whether gathering the necessary paperwork is worthwhile.\n\nBefore that conversation, it's crucial to clearly understand your financial picture. This includes knowing your annual income, debt levels, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio.\n\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nAccording to Brian Nevins, a sales manager at Bay Equity, understanding your purchasing power is crucial to determining your homebuying readiness. Many potential homebuyers are unsure about their credit situation or hesitate to check it for fear of negative impacts. However, experts recommend monitoring your credit for several months before house hunting to identify any areas for improvement.\n\n\"That's changed a lot in our industry, where we do soft credit verifications upfront now, and where it's going to have no impact on somebody's credit score,\" Nevins said. \"There's really no harm in checking.\"\n\nYour credit score determines whether you qualify for a mortgage and the interest rate you'll pay. A higher credit score typically means a lower interest rate.\n\nBuilding credit is important, but so is managing your debt. A high debt-to-income ratio, influenced by factors like student loans or credit card balances, can hinder your mortgage approval chances.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also:Gen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead.\n\nA high debt-to-income ratio is the primary reason mortgage applications are denied, according to Divounguy. Lenders use the ratio to assess whether you can handle an additional mortgage payment on top of your current debts.\n\nTo create a realistic homebuying budget, you must understand your debt-to-income ratio.\n\n\"Your debt-to-income ratio is simply the percentage of your monthly income dedicated to debt payments, including car loans, student loans, credit card minimums and your estimated mortgage payment,\" Nevins said.\n\nYour ability to afford a home depends on several factors beyond your credit and debt. Your area\u2019s median home price, down payment, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and potential HOA fees all play a role. Consulting with a mortgage professional can provide valuable insights into fully understanding your financial picture and homebuying potential.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a lot simpler.

        "title": "Why Is Zillow Group, Inc. (Z) the Best Stock to Buy According to Eminence Capital\u2019s Ricky Sandler?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) stands against the other stocks.\n\nInvesting prowess runs in Ricky Sandler's family. The manager of prominent hedge fund Eminence Capital had a 13F portfolio worth more than $7 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024. His father was a research analyst at Goldman Sachs, one of the premier investment banks in the world, and later went on to manage a hedge fund. Sandler has had a somewhat similar career trajectory, beginning as a research associate for Mark Asset Management before making his name as a hedge fund manager at Fusion Capital Management. In 1999, Sandler founded Eminence Capital, growing the small fund into a multi-billion dollar investment firm over the course of two decades. The fund focuses on uncovering value in the market through fundamental research, an art that seems to be dying on Wall Street as fast money schemes become more popular.\n\nThe investing philosophy of Sandler has been influenced by his work at Mark Asset Management and Fusion Capital Management. At the former, Sandler learned the importance of focusing on a bottom-up research strategy aimed at picking great businesses. At the latter, Sandler learned that investing in good businesses was not enough. In order to create wealth, money managers had a duty to invest in great businesses at value prices, thereby creating room for future growth. Sandler calls this the \u201cquality value\u201d approach to investing. He made these comments in an appearance on the Equity Mates podcast last year. Sandler, in remarks made during the podcast, stressed that investors should not only buy at good prices but should also not stay invested in equities when they become too expensive. Young investors would do well to pick up on this simple yet effective tip.\n\nAt Eminence Capital, Sandler has developed a long-short equity strategy that has paid huge dividends for clients. Per the hedge fund manager, the Asian debt crisis in the late 1990s was one of the formative events in his life that led him to understand the value of an effective shorting strategy. During the crisis, the International Monetary Fund had to pump in more than $40 billion into large economies in East Asia to contain the spread of the meltdown to the world economy. The company Sandler was a part of at the time owned stakes in many mid-cap Asian firms that were hit particularly hard by the crisis, leading to huge losses for his fund. Sandler now makes sure that his stock pickers spend at least half of their time developing individual stock shorts, a strategy that aims to build up the defenses of his fund should the market take a turn for the worst.\n\nStory continues\n\nSandler believes that in the present economic environment, only investors that have valuation discipline and short selling skills will be able to keep pace with the changing dynamics of the stock market. However, he also underlines that long bets remain equally important. The New York-based manager outlines his long investing philosophy as owning mispriced stocks that have the potential to take a turn for the better in the coming two or three years. Sandler emphasizes the importance of investing in ownable companies \u2014 businesses that he describes are well-positioned competitively, sound structurally with trusted management teams, and able to generate solid cash flows. Sandler urges money managers to invest only in firms that they would be comfortable investing in for their family portfolio. A look at the top picks in his latest 13F portfolio illustrates this strategy in action.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the stock portfolio of Eminence Capital according to the 13F filings submitted at the end of the first quarter of 2024. We selected the top 10 stocks from this portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of real estate agents trading tips and tricks in a modern office, representing markets across the country.\n\nZillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) CALL\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nEminence Capital\u2019s Stake: $366,508,530\n\nZillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) is a digital real estate firm. One of the reasons why Sandler has doubled down on his bullish bet on the firm is that the shares have lost nearly 25% in value over the past few months, creating a buying opportunity for long term bulls. Even as the stock dips, the underlying numbers for the firm remain strong. For example, the rentals business of the firm is growing at a healthy 30% year-over-year. The business is operating in a total addressable market of over $25 billion. The adjusted earnings of the firm are also growing at an impressive 20%, highlighting the health of the stock even amid a sell-off.\n\nLatest 13F filings show that Eminence Capital held over 7.5 million shares of Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) at the end of the first quarter of 2024 worth more than $366 million, representing 5.19% of the portfolio. Sandler increased the fund\u2019s stake in the firm by nearly 120% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the preceding quarter. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $10 million.\n\nOverall Z ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler.

        "title": "Top 10 No-Demo Renovation Projects of 2024",
        "content": "New data from Zillow and Thumbtack shows sellers can boost interest among buyers with these relatively affordable upgrades\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, July 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Thumbtack and Zillow\u00ae are revealing the top no-demo renovation home projects that can result in more attention from buyers. Many homeowners are not able to take on the stress or the cost of large renovations, especially with inflation and the cost of homeownership at an all-time high. Fortunately, certain features that are proven to be highly desirable in today's market don't require knocking down walls or a big budget. Thumbtack data finds these projects cost less than $5,000 on average nationwide. Top 10 No-Demo Renovation Projects\n\nThis research combines an average nationwide cost analysis based on millions of projects on Thumbtack with Zillow data on home features that boost daily saves and shares on the real estate platform. A strong indicator of how excited buyers are about a home is how frequently they save a home on Zillow or share it with a shopping partner. More saves and shares signal that a home is in high demand. The top 10 list also indicates how much more popular some of these projects have become among homeowners on Thumbtack compared to a year ago.\n\nTop 10 no-demo reno projects of 2024\n\nWindow box: This rectangular container for flowers, plants or herbs is installed outside, just below the window sill, adding color and curb appeal to a home. Homes with a window box can get 48% more saves and 52% more shares per day on Zillow compared to similar homes without this feature. The average national cost is $100\u2013$150 for professional installation and $15\u2013$900 for materials, depending on the types purchased. Open shelving: Open shelving allows homeowners to display meaningful and beautiful objects without introducing bulky furniture. Homes with open shelving can get an additional 37% more saves and 45% more shares per day on Zillow. The average national cost is $275 for professional installation, without the cost of shelves. According to Thumbtack data, closet system and shelving installations are up 31.5% year over year, indicating that homeowners are leaning into this trend. Painted brick: Homes with painted brick can get 31% more saves and 39% more shares per day on Zillow compared to similar homes. The average national cost is typically around $1.85\u2013$3.03 per square foot, and the national average for the entire job is $4,600\u2013$7,600, including labor, material and equipment. Vintage touches and finishes: Homes with vintage features not only have charm and character, but they can get 28% more saves and 31% more shares per day on Zillow compared to similar homes. The pricing for vintage decor and features varies dramatically, but homeowners can find great vintage pieces and accessories for less than $100. One example is vintage crown molding, which costs $2\u2013$50 per linear foot, depending on the material, and can make your ceilings look higher while adding architectural interest. It can also conceal imperfections at the junctions of walls and ceilings. Outdoor TV: One of summer's hottest features, homes with an outdoor TV can receive 28% more saves and 26% more shares per day than expected on Zillow. The average national cost is $175\u2013$300, though costs could increase depending on electrical capabilities and weatherproofing. Outdoor TV installations are up 12.7% year over year, according to Thumbtack data. Picket fence: A white picket fence is a classic feature that buyers never tire of. Homes that have one can get 27% more saves and 31% more shares per day on Zillow compared to homes that don't. The average national cost to install a picket fence is $7\u2013$45 per linear foot. Recently, a Thumbtack study found that more than one-third (39%) of homeowners said their dream yard would have a fenced-in space for pets. Pergola: As people spend more time in their yards and temperatures hit record highs, buyers are prioritizing solutions that offer shade. Pergolas are structures either freestanding or attached to a home that create shaded outdoor living space. Homes with a pergola can get 20% more saves and 24% more shares per day on Zillow compared to similar homes. The average national cost is $3,600 for a 10-by-10-foot pergola, including labor and materials. Fire pit: Summer nights filled with s'mores and stargazing require a fire pit. Homes that have one can get 19% more saves and 23% more shares per day on Zillow. The average national cost is a couple hundred dollars depending on the kit purchased. This is a DIY-friendly project, as materials are accessible at any local hardware store. Outdoor sound system: Homes with an outdoor sound system can get 18% more saves and 19% more shares per day on Zillow compared to similar homes. The average national cost is $500\u2013$2,000, depending on the type and quality of the system. Thumbtack recommends bundling this project with the installation of an outdoor TV to save some time and money, as the same pro will be able to set up your outdoor sound system in tandem with the TV. Smart lighting: Smart-home installations are up 21.8% year over year, according to Thumbtack data, and smart lighting is a huge part of this increase. Plus, homes with smart lighting can get 18% more saves and 23% more shares per day on Zillow. The average national cost is $308 for installation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Certain low-lift projects can deliver a high payoff because they elevate a home in the mind of a buyer,\" said Amanda Pendleton, Zillow's home trends expert. \"These features bring a wow factor to a home or they serve as a signal that a home is up-to-date, well-maintained or move-in ready. When it's time to sell, these features may ultimately help a home sell faster or for more money, because there will likely be more competition for that home among buyers.\"\n\n\"This data can reassure homeowners that they don't need to undergo a massive renovation to make a big impact on a home and increase buyer appeal,\" said Morgan Olsen, Thumbtack's design expert. \"Whether it's a DIY project or pro-worthy, these small changes can make a significant transformation.\"\n\nMethodology:\n\nThe analysis used listing data from 3.9 million homes listed for sale on Zillow between June 2023 and May 2024 for which complete data was available. Economists then looked for the presence or absence of 265 features mentioned in the listing descriptions. This analysis used multiple regression, comparing home views, saves and shares during their active listing period against their home type, region, listing month, pre-listing Zestimate\u00ae, price per square foot and ratio of list price to Zestimate. For more information on methodology, please contact press@zillow.com.\n\nNo-demo renovation projects are low-budget projects (less than $5,000) that can improve your home without any demolition. All year-over-year comparison data is based on findings from Thumbtack projects during January 2023\u2013April 2024. Pricing data is based on national average cost estimates and ranges using data provided either by Thumbtack pros or from external research; real prices may vary based on city and supply.

        "title": "Newly built homes are now cheaper than existing ones, and the discount is the greatest in 6 years",
        "content": "It feels a little absurd to say newly built homes are cheaper than existing homes, which have been lived in for years, but it\u2019s true. Per square foot, new homes sold for $3.50 less than existing homes in May. It might not sound like much to you, but it is the largest discount in at least six years, according toZillow.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at two homes that are 2,000 square feet, the difference between the two would be $7,000. You\u2019d be paying more for an older home that\u2019s been lived in and might even need remodeling. Before the pandemic, newly constructed homes \u201ccommanded a serious premium,\u201d according to Zillow, between $15 and $22 more per square foot than existing homes. So for two homes that are 2,000 square feet, the difference was at least $30,000\u2014the premium for a completely new home, unused and likely modern.\n\n\u201cNew builds have only been less expensive per square foot than existing homes in five other months since the start of 2018, and this is the biggest savings seen yet,\u201d Zillow said, adding that March was the last time new construction was more expensive per square foot.\n\nThere are metropolitan areas where the difference between the two is even more substantial. In San Diego, the per-square-foot discount for new homes is $57.10, per Zillow; in Salt Lake City, it\u2019s $53.60; and in Los Angeles, it\u2019s $52.40. It\u2019s a more than $40 difference in Austin, Washington DC, and Tampa, too.\n\nOn the other hand, there are places where the price per square foot is much more expensive for new homes. In San Jose, it\u2019s a $216.60 premium; in San Francisco, it\u2019s $137.10; and in Milwaukee, it\u2019s $87.60. Zillow didn\u2019t explain why there are such considerable differences, but it is interesting to see some of California\u2019s most costly cities on two separate sides of the new home versus existing home equation.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say the total sales price of new homes is cheaper than existing homes. In fact, new-build properties are about $54,000 more than existing homes, according to Zillow. But the math for comparing prices is changing as lot sizes for new homes and the share that are detached or are condos has evolved over recent years.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s new construction buyers are getting significantly smaller lots than those in prior years, and the lot-size advantage of buying existing homes is growing,\u201d Zillow said.\n\nExisting home prices are 52% higher than they were before the pandemic, while new home prices are only 26% higher. We all know home prices skyrocketed during the pandemic-fueled housing boom. But when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to combat scorching hot inflation, mortgage rates rose considerably from their historic lows. Would-be sellers held onto their homes, and now there\u2019s 33% fewer existing homes for sale than the pre-pandemic norm, according to Zillow, which noted the deficit is far greater in many markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile prices for existing homes soared, homebuilders offered incentives to bring back demand, whether it be via mortgage rate buydowns or simply building smaller homes. And in May, the median sales price of new houses sold was $417,400, below the median existing-home sales price of $419,300.\n\nFor a time, the new home market surpassed the existing home market in terms of sales (particularly as existing home sales fell to an almost three-decade low last year). But the most recent new home sales reading showed they dropped to a six-month low in May, kind of unexpectedly. Both existing home sales and new home sales for June are slated to be released this week, so we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s any shift in either pace.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Millennials' Secret to Homeownership: 25 Bargain Cities Where You Could Live the Good Life\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that buying a home is still out of reach for many millennials. According to Realtor.com, the median home price across the U.S. is $438k, but it\u2019s much higher in popular areas like California, Seattle, or New York: $787,000, $800,000, and $825,000, respectively.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Rory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100.\n\nFor a 10% down payment, the average first-time homebuyer could take more than 10 years to save the needed funds. And by that time, prices will be even higher.\n\nWhat if we told you there are cities with beautiful parks, interesting museums, great restaurants, and other amenities where the average home price hovers around $200k? It seems too good to be true, but they do exist.\n\nAccording to a report by the Dayton Convention & Visitors Bureau, the top 25 cities for homeownership aren\u2019t on the coasts. Most are clustered in the Midwestern states, from north to south. But before you close the page, check out the tremendous value they have to offer.\n\nNumber 25 on the list is Dayton, Ohio, known for its leadership in industries from water management to health care to IT. It\u2019s also the birthplace of aviation. The city is known for its rivers, parks, recreational activities, restaurants, and concert venues.\n\nTrending: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate \u2014 This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield\n\nIt has excellent schools, less traffic than larger cities, and a low cost of living compared to the national average. Not convinced? According to Zillow, the average home price is just $151,092, nearly one-third of the national average. Dayton residents spend an average of 24% of their income on living expenses, giving them more savings and vacations.\n\nTwo Ohio cities make the list, with Toledo ranked #19. Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, and Alabama all have two cities on the list. Indiana wins with three cities: Fort Wayne takes the #1 spot, with South Bend at #18 and Indianapolis at #21.\n\nThe other states with a single city on the list are Iowa, Louisiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Kansas.\n\nHickory, North Carolina, lands at #6. Before you think of hillbillies and run for the hills, take a minute to consider what Hickory offers. It\u2019s just 60 miles from Charlotte and is known as the furniture manufacturing capital of the US. You can find gorgeous furniture at outlet prices, so your new home will be beautifully furnished.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also:Will the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nHickory is in the Blue Ridge Mountains and boasts outdoor adventures, from the mountains to lakes, delicious restaurants, interesting concerts, and more. Plus, Charlotte is just a short drive away. The median household income is $63,531, higher than the national average. Better yet, the average Hickory resident spends 22.5% of their income on living expenses. As per Zillow, average home prices in Hickory are $288k, about 35% less than the national average.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for the best city to buy a home, Indianapolis takes the number one spot. It\u2019s known for the Indiana Speedway, children\u2019s museum, zoo, central canal, river park, cultural trails, and other outdoor adventures. Zillow reports that the median household income is $71,507, but residents spend less than 20% on living expenses. The average home price is $233k, almost half the national average.\n\nNot convinced you could withstand Midwest winters? Consider cities in Texas, Alabama, or even (milder) North Carolina. If you crave a bigger city, Lexington, Omaha, Tulsa, and Kansas City all made the list.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list:\n\nFort Wayne, Indiana Huntsville, Alabama Wichita, Kansas Springfield, Missouri Davenport, Iowa Hickory, North Carolina Montgomery, Alabama Green Bay, Wisconsin Little Rock, Arkansas Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Lexington, Kentucky Lafayette, Louisiana Omaha, Nebraska Brownsville, Texas Lincoln, Nebraska Peoria, Illinois Louisville, Kentucky South Bend, Indiana Toledo, Ohio Rockford, Illinois Indianapolis, Indiana McAllen, Texas Kansas City, Missouri Tulsa, Oklahoma Dayton, Ohio\n\nWhile the middle states were once called the \"flyover states,\" they\u2019ve grown over the last 30 years. You can get anything except an ocean in the middle states, and with the Great Lakes, they\u2019ve nearly got an ocean, too. These 25 cities offer all the coasts have, plus the ability to save for retirement, contribute to a 529 plan for your kids\u2019 college education, and even afford a house. The American dream isn\u2019t dead; it\u2019s living in the Midwest.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\nThis article Millennials' Secret to Homeownership: 25 Bargain Cities Where You Could Live the Good Life originally appeared on Benzinga.com",

On the one hand, internet listings are effective at disseminating information far and wide, casting a wide net for buyers and sellers to increase the chances of transactions. On the other hand, digitization in the real estate market could potentially disintermediate key players like agents who use information asymmetries to their advantage.\n\nThe 14 real estate services stocks we track reported a mixed Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 4.2%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 4% below consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, but real estate services stocks have performed well, with the share prices up 18.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nZillow (NASDAQ:ZG)\n\nFounded by Expedia co-founders Lloyd Frink and Rich Barton, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) is the leading U.S. online real estate marketplace.\n\nZillow reported revenues of $529 million, up 12.8% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 4.1%.

        "title": "Home prices are still sky-high, but the frenzied housing market is slowly coming down to Earth",
        "content": "After years of frenzy, the housing world is cooling off.\n\n\u201cHome listings are piling up as buyers step back from peak home shopping season faster than normal,\u201d Zillow\u2019s chief economist, Skylar Olsen, wrote in a monthly report published yesterday. \u201cAs competition cools, sellers are stepping up price cuts to try and entice buyers struggling with affordability.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cA housing market that for years has been defined by fast sales and few options is starting to look more like it did before the pandemic in terms of competition among buyers and their negotiating power, if not costs.\u201d\n\nSo while housing is nowhere near pre-pandemic affordability, it is less intense, and in some cases that can mean less costly. The total number of homes on the market is close to 23% more than last year, but of course, it\u2019s 33% below pre-pandemic levels. So in June, there were roughly 1,155,000 homes listed for sale. Still, \u201cthat\u2019s the smallest deficit\u201d in almost four years, Olsen said. Homes are staying on the market longer, too, by about a few more days than last summer, according to Zillow.\n\nAnd because competition isn\u2019t so fierce, in that there are fewer bidding wars and homes selling way above asking, sellers are slashing prices. Almost a fourth of listings saw a price cut last month; that\u2019s the highest rate in roughly six years for the season. \u201cWhile sellers still have a slight edge nationally, Zillow\u2019s market heat index shows a balanced market may be just over the horizon,\u201d Olsen wrote. \u201cCompetition is easing fastest in the South\u2014all major Southern markets are either neutral or buyer-friendly, with the exception of Dallas and Raleigh.\u201d\n\nStill, buying a home isn\u2019t cheap, and is a far cry from what it was four years ago. Median-income households can only afford mortgage payments on a typical home in nine of 50 metropolitan areas, and it\u2019s gotten to the point where a 20% down payment is barely enough. Last month, the typical home value was 3.2% higher than a year before; the typical mortgage payment is 6% higher than last year, and it has increased 112.5% since the pandemic. However, home price inflation has slowed on a monthly and annual basis.\n\nThere are even four major metropolitan areas where home values have dropped from a year ago\u2014New Orleans, Austin, San Antonio, and Birmingham, per Zillow\u2014but that means they\u2019re up in the other 46 metros.\n\nAnd mortgage rates have fallen, giving some buyers more purchasing power (the average 30-year fixed daily mortgage rate is 6.83%). For its part, Capital Economics expects \u201cmortgage rates to continue falling, but not by enough to fully offset the effects of mortgage rate \u2018lock-in,\u2019\u201d the research firm\u2019s economist, Thomas Ryan, wrote in an analysis published yesterday. Essentially, he doesn\u2019t see a wave of sellers crashing into the market, at least not in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cNevertheless, home listings have crept up this year and we expect that trend to continue given the degree of pent-up selling demand,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRising supply will slowly erode seller power, with house price growth slowing,\u201d further into next year and the year after. All the while, he sees mortgage rates falling to 6% roughly two years from now. But existing home sales are still depressed, and Capital Economics sees them remaining muted throughout the next two years.\n\nIt seems the housing world is \u201cslowly moving towards balance,\u201d as Capital Economics put it. It\u2019s better, all things considered, but it isn\u2019t a reversal of the fastest deterioration in affordability housing has ever seen.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Zillow Says These Five Rental Markets Are Still Smoking Hot\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nZillow\u2019s monthly rental data offers a compelling overall view of the rental market. It shows that residential rental growth has plummeted from its post-pandemic highs. Despite stabilizing after pandemic highs, there are still a few markets that are increasing more than the norm, and the locations may surprise you.\n\nRory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100.\n\nThe Broad Strokes On The Rental Market\n\nZillow\u2019s data put U.S. rent at $2,054 in June, up 0.5% month over month. This isn\u2019t far off from the pre-pandemic change for this time of year, which is 0.6%. Rental activity tends to slow over the late spring and early summer and then heat up in late summer and early fall as people want to find a home before the school year begins. Rents are up about 3.5% year over year and nearly 33% since the pandemic, a number that has severely burdened many renters. Rents are up in 48 out of 50 markets.\n\nSingle-family rentals continue to outpace multifamily. For homes, rents are 4.7% higher than last year, with a typical price of $2,288. Multifamily rents are just 2.7% higher than last year, with a typical rent of $1,906. One warning sign is the reliance on concessions. Zillow found that 33% of rentals used concessions to help close the contract.\n\nThe Zillow Observed Rent Index shows that some more affordable markets are now experiencing larger-than-average rent increases. Let\u2019s examine these top markets and if current residents are income-mortgage-ready, meaning that the payment in their market would not exceed 30% of income.\n\n1. Hartford, CT \u2014 7.8%\n\nThe capital of Connecticut has seen its population decline slightly in recent years. It has an estimated 119,669 residents. Owner occupancy is low in the area, just 25.6%. The median family income is $112,000. Home values are relatively low in the area. Zillow estimates the value to be \u200b\u200b$176,089, far below national averages, after home values rose by 7.2% year over year.\n\nAccording to a report Zillow published last month, even with today's high interest rates, 18.1% of rental families in Hartford are mortgage- ready. Redfin's data shows that the median home price in Hartford has climbed by 25.1% over the past year, giving renters few options.\n\n2. Cleveland, OH \u2014 7.2%\n\nCleveland, Ohio, is quite a bit larger, with an estimated 362,656 residents, down 2.6% since 2020. The median family income is lower at $85,000, but 22.4% of residents are income-mortgage qualified, putting it in the top five of Zillow's list of markets with a high mortgage readiness ratio. Only 40.9% of the housing is owner-occupied.\n\nStory continues\n\nZillow estimates that Cleveland\u2019s home value is $113,340, up 10.8% year over year. The gap between value and sales price is far more modest in Cleveland. Redfin's median sale price is $130,000, up 18.2%, showing that the window of opportunity may also be closing here. People are on to Cleveland's charms. This year, it made Money.com's list of the top 50 places to live in the United States.\n\n3. Louisville, KY- 6.8%\n\nThis city is famous for the Kentucky Derby, its long pathways along the Ohio River, and for being the birthplace of boxing legend Muhammad Ali. Louisville, Kentucky, and surrounding areas have a population of 622,981, down 1.4% since 2020. Over 60.4% of the housing in the area is owner-occupied.\n\nLouisville's family income is also $85,000; around 20% of the population is income-mortgage ready. The home values are higher here: $243,600, up 3.6% year over year per Zillow. The median sales price of $269,900 is up 11.7% year over year.\n\nCan you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors.\n\n4. Providence, RI \u2014 6.3%\n\nOur fourth city takes us back to New England and Providence, Rhode Island. This university town has a small population of just 190,792 residents, although the Census Bureau estimates the county at 660,615. The population level has stayed steady, and 39.9% of homes are owner-occupied in the city, and 55.8% within the county.\n\nHome values are higher here, Zillow pegs the current home value at $397,536, up 11.2% year over year. And the sales climate is even more grim. The median sale price per Redfin clocks in at a blistering $501,000, up 19.3% year over year. With a median income of $104,000, Zillow estimates just 7.7% of the population is income-mortgage-ready. For many in this market, renting may be a better choice despite the increase.\n\n5. Milwaukee, WI \u2014 5.7%\r\nWith the Republican National Convention in town, all eyes are on Milwaukee this week. Milwaukee's population is 561,385, down 2.9% from 2020.\n\nWe are back in more reasonable territory when it comes to home prices. Zillow says the average home value is $210,407, up 9.2%. The median sale price isn't too far from that number, coming in at $215,000 per Redfin, an increase of 9.1% year over year. However, its lower median family income of $91,000 means only 14.4% are income-mortgage ready.\n\nRent isn't the only reason to live in an area, but keeping an eye on rental affordability is key for tenants, homeowners and potential real estate investors. Smaller cities may look particularly tempting, with rental prices straining budgets in cities like Austin, Miami, New York, and Los Angeles.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "title": "Nearly 1 in 4 sellers cut home prices as inventory grows",
        "content": "Competition is fading fast after the peak of this year's affordability-challenged home shopping season\n\nMonthly home value growth, while still positive, hit a 14-year low for June as competition relaxes. Inventory rose in all but five major metros while the nationwide deficit continues to shrink. Affordability challenges persist \u2014 new mortgages are affordable in just 11 of 50 major markets.\n\nSEATTLE, July 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Home listings are piling up as buyers step back from the peak of home shopping season faster than normal, according to the latest monthly report1 from Zillow\u00ae. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"A growing segment of homes that aren't competitively priced or well marketed are lingering on the market. Sellers are increasingly cutting prices to entice buyers struggling with affordability,\" said Skylar Olsen, chief economist of Zillow. \"For years, the housing market has been defined by fast sales and few options. Now it's starting to look more like it did before the pandemic in terms of competition, if not costs. As the wait for mortgage rate relief drags on, slower price growth and even dips in some areas will help buyers catch up on saving for a down payment.\"\n\nInventory slowly recovers The total number of homes on the market has risen throughout the year, ticking up 4% from May to June to stand nearly 23% above last year's low level. While inventory levels are still about 33% below pre-pandemic averages, that's the smallest deficit since the fall of 2020, when the pool of available homes was quickly dropping.\n\nInventory is higher than last year in all of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas except two \u2014 New York and Cleveland \u2014 and rose month over month in all but five.\n\nAttractive listings are selling relatively quickly. But buyers still in the market are enjoying a few more days to weigh their choices than they had last summer. Homes sold in June were typically on the market for 15 days before the seller accepted an offer. That's five days shorter than pre-pandemic norms, the smallest difference since June 2020.\n\nHigh costs weigh on buyers While mortgage rates have eased from May peaks, buyers are still contending with costs that have risen far faster than wages. A median-income household can afford mortgage payments when buying a typical home in just 11 of 50 major markets, even when putting 20% down.\n\nWith many buyers pushed to the sidelines by costs, Zillow's Sales Nowcast in June took a 9% step down from May; sales are 35% lower than pre-pandemic norms.\n\nSlowing appreciation could give buyers a break Home value growth has slowed as inventory rises. Annual appreciation is a reasonable 3.2% nationally, down from a 2024 peak of 4.6% in March. Monthly growth has decelerated to 0.6% \u2014 the slowest June appreciation since 2011.\n\nStory continues\n\nSlower home value growth in the months ahead could give struggling buyers a chance to make up ground. Zillow forecasts home values to rise just 1% nationally through June 2025.\n\nCooling competition brings price cuts While sellers still have a slight edge nationally, Zillow's market heat index shows a balanced market may be just over the horizon. Competition is easing fastest in the South; all major Southern markets are either neutral or buyer-friendly, with the exception of Dallas and Raleigh.\n\nSellers are cutting prices more often to entice buyers. Nearly one-quarter of listings (24.5%) received a price cut in June, the highest rate for this time of year in Zillow records dating back to 2018.\n\nIt can be tricky to keep up with rapidly changing list prices and mortgage rates. Zillow's new BuyAbility tool uses up-to-date mortgage rates to show home shoppers price ranges and monthly payments they personally could afford, and whether they're likely to be approved for a loan. Shoppers can make sure all their results on Zillow stay within a set monthly budget by using the search by monthly cost filter.\n\nMetropolitan \r\nArea* June Zillow \r\nHome Value \r\nIndex (ZHVI)

        "title": "Rents are reheating after flatlining for some time",
        "content": "Rents were falling, then they were flatlining, and now they\u2019re reheating. The typical rent last month was $2,054, an increase of 3.5% from a year earlier, which happens to be the fastest annual pace since July last year, according toZillow.\n\n\u201cThe months long slowdown in the rental market appears to be leveling off as the busy summer season kicks off,\u201d Zillow said in its monthly rental report published this week. \u201cRents are growing at their fastest annual pace in nearly a year\u2014though the margins are slim\u2014and concessions offered by landlords and property managers have flattened after reaching a three-year high this spring.\u201d\n\nOn a monthly basis, rents rose 0.5% in June, which is pretty normal. But as Zillow said, concessions are down slightly, and it could mean landlords are more confident than they were a couple of months ago. Still, \u201ca portion of this rental market reheating is likely because of seasonal factors,\u201d Zillow said, since renters sometimes move during the summer because of school schedules and leases ending.\n\nSeparately, Redfin said the median apartment asking rent rose 0.7% in June from a year earlier to $1,654\u2014calling it \u201cthe biggest gain in over a year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a change for the rental world. Toward the end of last year, Redfin found asking rents experienced their greatest decline in more than three years, \u201cthe result of a building boom in recent years,\u201d it said at the time. But then, at the beginning of this year, Redfin found asking rents had flatlined, suggesting rents were \u201cleveling off after surging during the pandemic and then rapidly slowing,\u201d the analysis read, again pointing to a building boom that\u2019s led to apartment vacancies for landlords.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: Rents are still high. According to Zillow, rents have increased by 32.8% since the pandemic. Already half of all renter households, or 22.4 million renters, were considered cost-burdened, meaning they spent more than 30% of their income on housing costs; and the number of severely cost-burdened renter households reached an all-time high of 12.1 million, as of 2022, according to a recent report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nRents are up on an annual basis in 48 of 50 major metropolitan areas, but in some places they\u2019re increasing much more significantly than in others. For instance, in Hartford, rents are 7.8% higher than a year ago; in Cleveland, they\u2019re 7.2% higher, per Zillow. But a separate analysis from Redfin published earlier this week found asking rents fell dramatically in Jacksonville last month, a 12% year-over-year decline. Asking rents also fell in Tampa, Orlando, Miami, and Austin.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s some variation between single-family rents and multifamily rents, too. The latter saw rents increase 2.7% from the year before and 26.7% from the start of the pandemic. Single-family rents, on the other hand, are 4.7% higher than last year and 39.6% higher than before the pandemic began.\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s always cities that are more affordable than others. It\u2019s the usual suspects: Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, and St. Louis, where people spend roughly 20% of their median income on typical rent. Then there\u2019s Miami, New York, and Los Angeles, where people typically spend roughly 40% of their income on rent.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: We just got our best inflation report in more than three years, but if rents are on the rise again, it\u2019s not clear what that\u2019ll mean for inflation in the coming months, as housing is a substantial component. On the back of the consumer price index release, Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, said in a statement: \u201cThe shelter component of the Consumer Price Index is still running relatively hot, with shelter inflation at 5.2% in June. However, shelter enters the CPI calculation with a lag.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

The fastest-growing rents are in more affordable markets in the Northeast and Midwest, led by Hartford and Cleveland. Nationally, rents are up 3.5% year over year, the fastest annual growth since last July.\n\nSEATTLE, July 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- While rents are most expensive in large coastal markets like New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area and Boston, the fastest-growing rents are in unexpected places.

Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"More people move during the summer, which causes the rental market to heat up,\" said Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow. \"Renters are being drawn to more affordable areas within the Northeast and Midwest.

Cleveland (7.2%), Louisville (6.8%), Providence (6.3%) and Milwaukee (5.7%) round out the top five.\n\nThe typical rent eclipses $3,000 in a few coastal markets. New York City is the most expensive rental market with a typical rent of $3,472 across the metro area, according to the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI), while StreetEasy\u00ae data shows the median asking rent is $4,400 in Manhattan. Coming in just behind is the San Jose metro area with a typical rent of $3,429, followed by Boston($3,127), San Francisco($3,119) and San Diego($3,083). Los Angeles, with a typical asking rent of $2,975, could join that list later this summer if the current pace of rent growth holds.\n\nNationally, the typical rent is $2,054, according to ZORI.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Believe Zillow (ZG) Could Rally 25.02%: Here's is How to Trade",
        "content": "Shares of Zillow Group (ZG) have gained 7.4% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $44.65, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $55.82 indicates a potential upside of 25%.\n\nThe average comprises 22 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $35 to a high of $70, with a standard deviation of $9.27. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 21.6% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 56.8% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.\n\nBut, for ZG, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.\n\nHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nWhy ZG Could Witness a Solid Upside\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.5% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.\n\nMoreover, ZG currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much ZG could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Move\u2019s trade secret lawsuit is a \u2018PR stunt,\u2019 says CoStar\u2019s Andy Florance",
        "content": "judges gavel laying on a pile of money\n\nTo Andy Florance, the CEO of CoStar Group, the lawsuitMove, Inc., the parent company of listing portal rival Realtor.com, recently filed against his firm is all a \u201cPR stunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cEffectively, you create a bogus story and you use a relatively junior person as a pawn and you get a story out there,\u201d Florance said. \u201cAnd the question is why? What is their strategy with that? Realtor.com is owned by NewsCorp, which is a global, super sophisticated media organization run by the Murdochs, so they play hard ball in the media space.\u201d\n\nIn response to Florance\u2019s remarks, a Realtor.com spokesperson said the firm does not \u201ccomment on pending litigation. The court documents speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nFlorance said he believes the lawsuit, which was filed against CoStar Group and James Kaminsky, a former Realtor.com employee and current Homes.com employee, was motivated by the listing platform\u2019s recent struggles, which, by CoStar\u2019s metrics, have caused the firm to fall behind Zillow and Homes.com in the so-called \u201cportal wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe numbers are clear. The numbers are verified \u2014 we have 156 million unique monthly visits for our Homes network and they have 72 million, so we are about 84 million ahead of them in monthly visitors and that is a nine alarm fire for them. That is a big problem,\u201d Florance said.\n\nAdditionally, Florance anticipates changes come to the real estate industry via the business practice changes outlined in the National Association of Realtors\u2019commission lawsuit settlement agreement are better suited for Homes.com\u2019s \u201cyour listing, your lead model,\u201d over the model Realtor.com uses, which Florance calls \u201clead diversion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey take leads that are coming in\u00a0and deceive the homebuyer into thinking that the person they are calling is the listing agent and then sell that lead to someone else and agents hate that business model,\u201d Florance said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen them upset with Zillow for doing that, but some agents are confused and think Realtor.com is part of NAR and that it has their best interests at heart.\u201d\n\nFlorance noted that Zillow has been working to diversify its offerings over the past few years and is moving away from what he feels is a lead diversion model, which he believes is a smart call, as he feels the lead diversion models \u201cwon\u2019t survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cRealtor.com is responding by doubling down on lead diversion and then doing PR stunts to confuse everybody,\u201d Florance said. \u201cIt is just sort of a reality of the way the company operates and they are very aggressive in the media space.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in California, Move claims that Kaminsky, who worked at Realtor.com until January before being hired at Homes.com in March, stole trade secrets to help fuel the\u00a0rapid growth of\u00a0Homes.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nMove alleges that Kaminsky accessed\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0documents through June of this year without being detected, despite leaving the firm in January and joining CoStar in March. According to the complaint, Kaminsky accessed information from\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0\u201cat least 37 times after CoStar hired him,\u201d violating federal and state computer fraud laws to do so.\n\nThe documents that Move claims Kaminsky accessed include information about content planned for\u00a0Realtor.com; ideas for future stories; metrics showing user traffic; a list of contacts; lists of\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0employees and their compensation; and other private business information.\n\nWhile the suit alleges that Kaminsky is leading a team of writers at Homes.com that are building a product similar to\u00a0Realtor.com\u2019s news and insights page, according to Florance, Kaminsky in facts edits condo listing descriptions. Prior to the filing of this lawsuit, Florance said he had never even heard of Kaminsky.\n\n\u201cI have never met him,\u201d Florance said. \u201cI talked to five or six people before I found someone who would look him up for me. I do feel really badly for this guy. He is effectively a writer and all of a sudden he is in the media for this nonsense and he\u2019s got News Corp. after him.\u201d\n\nAssuming Kaminsky has in fact not done anything wrong, Florance said CoStar will support Kaminsky throughout this lawsuit.\n\nFor Florance, Move\u2019s escalation of the feud between the two firms was not surprising given Move\u2019s track record, which includes suing Zillow in 2014 after Errol Samuelson resigned from Move and joined Zillow on the same day. In their 2014 suit, Move alleged that Samuelson and Zillow stole trade secrets and proprietary information, and that they then made efforts to cover up the alleged theft. The two sides reached a settlement in 2016, which resulted in Zillow paying Move $130 million.\n\nDespite similar claims, Florance believes any comparisons between the suits ends there.\n\n\u201cI think it is a complete mismatch,\u201d Florance said. \u201cWe are not talking about executive officers, we are talking about a guy who is an editor on condo writing.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Florance said he does not expect this lawsuit to be much of a story calling it \u201cquite silly and a little pathetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is just a messy application and a knee jerk reaction that is not terribly well through out,\u201d Florance said. \u201cI think it is because the \u201cyour listing your lead\u201d model that we are doing is going to be a big program for Realtor.com. Agents prefer it hands down.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Average American Mortgage Payment Has Spiked 96% In The Past Four Years",
        "content": "The Average American Mortgage Payment Has Spiked 96% In The Past Four Years\n\nIt's too early to determine whether the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates has benefited America's economy. However, the impact of higher interest rates on mortgage payments is evident. According to Zillow, the average mortgage payment in America has surged by 96% in the last four years. This substantial rise undoubtedly causes significant financial strain for many homeowners.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWill the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing with just $100 Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nZillow also highlights another concerning trend: homebuyers in major metropolitan areas of the United States now require an average down payment of $127,000 to purchase a home and comfortably manage the mortgage. It's important to note that this figure isn't for luxurious properties in places like Pacific Palisades or The Hamptons but for regular homes.\n\nThat's a lot of liquid money for even a relatively wealthy person to come up with, much less someone earning the median household income in America of $74,000 per year (according to the U.S. Census). This explains why Zillow's study also showed that 43% of homebuyers in 2023 reported having to rely on a financial gift from family and/or friends to help raise funds for the down payment.\n\nThese high down payments are a direct result of today's interest rates. Lenders consider borrowers \"comfortably\" able to afford a mortgage when the monthly payment is equivalent to (or less than) one-third of the borrower's average monthly salary. Zillow data shows the average monthly payment is $2,200, which a buyer making $77,000 per year could theoretically afford.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nHowever, once today\u2019s interest rates are factored into the equation, the six-figure down payment may be the only way for borrowers to get an affordable payment. Now that the average down payment of $127,000 is roughly one-third of America's median home price and nearly double America's median household income, the housing market has shown signs of slowing down. Despite that, it's worth noting that interest rates aren't the only factor driving up mortgage payments.\n\nIt's important to remember that a \"mortgage payment\" includes several components: loan principal, loan interest, property taxes, and insurance. This total amount is what borrowers must pay monthly to meet their mortgage obligations. Home insurance costs are rising in many states, especially regions at high risk of natural disasters like the Gulf Coast and Pacific coast, contributing to increased mortgage payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nHomeowners in two of America's most populated states, Florida and California, are struggling with rate spikes due to insurers leaving the state or protecting themselves against future claims. While this makes sense on paper, adding $400 per month to a mortgage payment for insurance premium hikes exacerbates the financial strain caused by interest rates on loans originated in the last four years.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk\u2019s secret mansion in Austin revealed through court filings.

        "title": "We\u2019re passing through \u2018the worst housing affordability crisis\u2019 ever seen, former Housing Secretary says\u2014and it isn\u2019t going to fix itself",
        "content": "Home prices and rents skyrocketed during the pandemic-fueled housing boom, and mortgage rates subsequently soared. Because mortgage rates shot up from historic lows so suddenly, people stopped selling their homes, and because the country is underbuilt by millions of homes, the sales halt didn\u2019t help. The housing market has cooled down since: Home prices aren\u2019t increasing exponentially, mortgage rates are lower than the more than two-decade high reached last year, rents are generally flatlining, and inventory has picked up. Still, everything feels very different than before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just coming through the worst housing affordability crisis we\u2019ve ever seen in this country,\u201d Shaun Donovan, former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama era and chief executive of housing nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners, said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. \u201cWe had 18% year-over-year increase in rents, home prices rising at levels we\u2019ve never seen. So we are seeing some leveling off, but it\u2019s at a level that is well beyond what folks could afford.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just going to turn around by itself. We have too little housing in this country, and we\u2019ve got to build more.\u201d Donovan later put the housing shortage at between 5 and 7 million homes, but estimates vary.\n\nThe biggest driver of inflation\n\nUrban economists, housing policy analysts, real estate executives, and others have said it time and time again: More homes need to be built. But of course that\u2019s easier said than done. Local governments and neighborhoods hold a lot of the power when it comes to development. Still, Donovan said, this recent bout of unaffordability is spurring discussion among mayors, governors, and lawmakers.\n\nNot to mention, he said, \u201cthe primary thing that\u2019s driving inflation today is housing prices. So we\u2019ve got to do more on the housing front in order to bring inflation down.\u201d And while the housing situation has somewhat calmed down, \u201cwe should recognize that we\u2019ve been up at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before in terms of the affordability crisis.\u201d\n\nDonovan pointed to a recently released report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies, which found almost one in four homeowners were \u201cstretched worryingly thin,\u201d and half of all renter households were considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on housing, as of 2022.\n\nFor context, the median rent for all bedrooms and all property types is $2,150, according toZillow. In May, the median existing home sales price was $419,300, the highest price ever recorded, according to the National Association of Realtors. And at the moment, the average 30-year fixed daily mortgage rate is 7.08% (the weekly one is 6.95%). Separately, Zillow\u2019s monthly housing report for May found home values are 45% higher than before the pandemic, and the typical mortgage payment has more than doubled, increasing 115% since pre-pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nAndy Walden, vice president of enterprise research strategy at ICE Mortgage Technology, who was also a part of the CNBC interview, said most baseline forecasts for the housing market don\u2019t really predict a decline in national home prices. \u201cIt\u2019s more for a neutral housing market for a couple of years to help this kind of rebalance,\u201d he said. But that\u2019s not accounting for pandemic boomtowns, such as Austin, which has seen its home prices fall considerably from their peak. \u201cThere are going to be some markets that come down, but nationally, expect it to go more lateral than down,\u201d Walden said.\n\nZillow, for one, expects home prices to fall 1.2% between May this year and next, while Moody\u2019s expects them to rise 0.4%. And Fannie Maesees home prices ending next year up 1.5%. We\u2019ll see who\u2019s the closest.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Zillow Group, Inc. (Z): A Good Stock to Buy and Hold According to Cathie Wood?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) stands against the other stocks.\n\nAs the saying goes, time and tide wait for nobody. This also holds true for Wall Street, where not only are fortunes made in a blink of an eye, but things can take a 180 degree turn the next moment. The same appears to be true for Cathie Wood of Ark Investment. While most hedge funds focus on creating balanced portfolios that seek to leverage all kinds of stocks, Wood's firm chooses to focus exclusively on high growth sectors that it believes will disrupt the future. Wood is one of Tesla's biggest bulls, and her insights have proven to be correct as the electric vehicle maker has defied all predictions of doom and gloom and managed to deliver hundreds of thousands of vehicles globally.\n\nSince Insider Monkey tracks hedge fund data and investments to provide readers with the best stock picks, we've been following Wood for quite some time now. We took a look at her long term stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold For 5 Years According To ARK\u2019s Cathie Wood in 2021. Back then, Wood was a celebrity as her high-profile bets on the technology industry were paying off as the sector surged due to the booming demand in tech resulting from lock downs and stay at home mandates. Wood's fund returned 20% in 2020, and it led to a long interview with Bloomberg. In this talk, she stressed that Ark's investment horizon was five years, so any temporary corrections left her unfazed since the firm was in for the long haul. She added that while big ticket technology names were good stocks, the goal of her firm was to identify the next FANGs (now FAANG), and one sector that was ripe for growth was the DNA sector. Other sectors that she highlighted were ripe for growth in 2021 were artificial intelligence, energy storage, robotics, and blockchain.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, let's see how her top stocks have performed since then. Focusing exclusively on her top ten stocks back then and as of the first quarter of this year, only four stocks remain on the list. The rest have either been relegated to lower weights in the portfolio or have been eliminated altogether. The four stocks that remain have displayed mixed performance since the start of 2021. The worst performer has lost 86% since then, while the others are down by 73% to 39%. However, since these stocks are nevertheless still a part of Ark's portfolio, it's clear that Wood's is convinced of their potential to disrupt the market and is holding on to them with this belief.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the stocks that were eliminated, several of these have bled more than 80% since then, while one has lost all of its value and been de listed from the NASDAQ exchange. Other stocks have also lost more than 90% of their value since 2021, and given that these belong to sectors such as telehealth and online education, it's understandable since these sectors posted unbelievable gains during the era of lock downs but failed to retain investor interest once the situation normalized. Finally, none of the stocks that were part of Cathie Wood's top stocks in 2021 have posted returns since then.\n\nShifting gears, investing in 2024 has seen the stock market divided into technology and non technology sectors. Even within the former, it's mainly artificial intelligence and associated stocks that have delivered strong returns. So, Wood, whose firm targets high growth and disruptive stocks, has continued to struggle this year too. Ark Invest's flagship ARKK fund is down 16.7% year to date, while tech heavy stock indexes are up by almost 20%. Disruptive companies require easy credit and robust business spending -\u00a0 both of which struggle in a high interest rate environment.\n\nHowever, not all of Cathie Wood's 2024 stock picks have suffered. Some of the strongest performers belong to social media, cloud-based advertising, financial services, molecular testing, and counter terrorism data analytics services. These stocks are up by 48%, 36%, 83%, 76%, and 52% year to date. On the flip side, some sectors that have struggled are biotechnology and software as a service (SaaS). Cathie Wood's biotechnology stocks have lost anywhere between 86% to 64%, while her SaaS pick has bled 58%.\n\nThe last couple of years have been hard for growth stocks that are not part of the booming semiconductor industry. This is because of high interest rates, which not only damped investor risk appetite but also made it difficult for these firms to invest in growth. Since Wood is a pure play growth investor at heart, it's unsurprising that her stocks have also suffered during this period. Ark's latest investment portfolio was worth $14.4 billion as of March 2024 end, and given that some investors are optimistic that the Fed might finally start to cut interest rates soon, we decided to do a follow up piece and take a look at the top Cathie Wood stocks during Q4 2020 and see how they have performed since then. When reading about these stocks, readers are also advised to remember that the market of 2024 is a complete 180 degrees from the market of 2020 as back then interest rates were low and Internet and personal computing stocks were booming.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best Cathie Wood stocks to buy and hold for five years, we scanned her Q4 2020 SEC filings and picked out the top ten stocks in which her firm had invested the most. Then, their performance since then was evaluated.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of real estate agents trading tips and tricks in a modern office, representing markets across the country.\n\nZillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z)\n\nArk Investment's Q4 2020 Investment Stake: $841 million\n\nNumber of Q1 2024 Hedge Fund Investors: 77\n\nShare Price Performance Since 2020 End: -64.3%\n\nZillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) is a software company that operates a diversified platform for real estate transactions in the US. Ark Invest first took a stake worth $7.9 million in the firm in Q2 2019. This grew to $1.2 billion in Q2 2021, and sits at $9.6 million as of Q1 2024. October and November 2021 were particularly rough for Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z)'s shares, after its announcement that it would exit the home buying market. Back then, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) bought and resold homes, and provided the associated mortgage and escrow services. This segment generated $1.4 billion in revenue in 2020, but its inability to price the home market led to $500 million in write offs in a tumultuous era for the market during the coronavirus crisis. Since 2020 end, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) has failed to grow its revenue. It sat at $2.1 billion in 2021 end and dropped to $1.9 billion in 2023.\n\nDue to its business model, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) has been unable to catch a break especially since high interest rates depress the housing and real estate market. This has led management to position the firm as a technology provider. During the Q1 2024 earnings call, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z)'s management shared:\n\nIn an ongoing tough rate environment, we also continued to make strong progress in mortgages with Q1 revenue of $31 million, up 19% year-over-year and purchase mortgage origination volume growing more than 130% year-over-year. So in a hostile housing market and a noisy industry environment, why is Zillow outperforming? The simple answer is that Zillow is wholly-focused on solving real consumer problems with software in a giant industry that has historically had very little R&D investment. Digitally re-platforming and integrating a huge, disparate local industry where transactions are relatively infrequent is an audacious undertaking.\n\nNo other company is really even attempting it. We are advantaged primarily because we are a product and technology company first, and are able to attract and retain the especially talented people, who know how to build market and support great software products. This enables us to focus completely on delighting our consumers and their valued partners in pursuit of the dream of using technology to make moving simple and joyful. Our product prowess over the years has put Zillow in the enviable position of having a large engaged audience, who come to us organically, an audience who love, trust and rely on our brand. This product-led organic marketing growth story is rare, but it is common for the great ones. Those are the products and brands we admire the most.\n\nOverall Z ranks 8th on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years according to Cathie Wood. You can visit 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Woodto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of Z as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Bargain Priced San Francisco Home Shows Good Things Come To Those Who Wait ... For A Really Long Time",
        "content": "Russian Hill is one of San Francisco's most expensive neighborhoods, where homes routinely fetch seven-figure prices after fierce bidding wars between prospective buyers. Knowing this, most people would assume there's a catch when a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house on a Cul-de-sac in Russian Hill hits the market for $488,000, and they would be right. The buyer will receive a 66% discount on the property, but they can't move in until 2053.\n\nAccording to details listed on Zillow, the delay is due to a tenant occupying the property. The tenant holds San Francisco's \"protected tenant status,\" a provision of San Francisco law that prevents landlords from evicting tenants who meet certain criteria as long as the tenant is paying rent.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of this city. Here\u2019s how to invest in its growth before he floods it with new tech workers.\n\nSan Francisco tenants can claim protected tenant status if they are elderly and/or disabled and have resided in the same place for more than 10 years. According to SFGate, the law granting special protection status was passed in 1998 during the dot-com boom when it became lucrative for landlords to evict existing tenants and raise rents dramatically.\n\nThe tenant of the heavily discounted property has additional protections in the form of a favorable lease they signed with the current owner. According to the listing, \"The tenant's current lease appears to grant tenants strong long-term rent rate amount restrictions and an unconventional method of rental payment, with possible occupancy rights until 2053.\" They are currently paying $416.67 per month, which is thousands of dollars below market rent.\n\nThe exceptionally tenant-friendly terms of the current lease and the strength of San Francisco's tenant protection laws explain why the property is being sold at such a discount. According to the New York Post, the unique restrictions on the buyer's ownership rights are why Zillow has marked the property's value down from $1,500,000 last month to just above $520,000 in June.\n\nTrending: This real estate fund backed by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nIncredibly, the property has been viewed over 40,000 times on Zillow and even has a pending deal after just a few weeks on the market. Other properties on the same Cul-de-sac are valued between $1,400,000 and $3,000,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs unorthodox as the arrangement may sound, it's not a first for Russian Hill. Last year, another home on Russian Hill with protected tenant status sold for $10,000,000, half its estimated net worth.\n\nSpeaking about the discounted property, Attorney Steven MacDonald told the New York Post, \"It's for a very unique buyer who's willing to accept a substantial discount \u2014 maybe two-thirds. They might pay $1 million for a $3 million house and wait 20 to 30 years before they can move in.\" The Zillow listing describes the property as an \"excellent investment opportunity for just the right buyer.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue against the potential upside of this property. It is listed for roughly a third of its actual value and could easily appreciate several times in value in the 30 years before the buyer moves in. However, the \"right\" buyer needs deep pockets and a sincere appreciation for the adage that \"Good things come to those who wait.\"\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "title": "San Francisco home crashes more than 60% in value after listing says buyers must wait decades to move in",
        "content": "A three-bedroom, two-bathroom home built in 1924 in an upscale San Francisco neighborhood saw its value tumble after the recently listed property came with a major catch.\n\nThe single-family house on North View Court in Russian Hill went on the market for $488,000 on Zillow two weeks ago. That looks like a steal considering other homes on the cul-de-sac are valued at well above $1 million, with one approaching $3 million.\n\nBut any buyer would have to wait decades to actually move in because there's a tenant living there who's only paying $416.67 in monthly rent and isn't going anywhere for a while.\n\n\"Tenant's current lease appears to grant tenants strong long term rent rate amount restrictions, unconventional method of rental payment, and possible occupancy rights until 2053,\" the Zillow listing says. \"This is an AS-IS sale and seller hereby reserves the right to reject, counter and/or accept any offer. Seller & listing agent do not guarantee access to the home and STRONGLY recommend buyers review the seller disclosure package/addenda and confer with a San Francisco landlord/tenant attorney BEFORE making offer.\"\n\nThe home's previous owner was more than 100 years old and died by natural causes in the home, the listing adds.\n\nDespite the home's \"nice curb appeal\" and Edwardian-style design, its $488,000 list price is well below Zillow's $526,500 \"Zestimate\" and down sharply from its value of $1.5 million just last month, according to the New York Post, representing a decline of more than 60%.\n\nThe house still drew a drew long line of prospective buyers last week, local TV reports said. That may be because the listing advertises the home as \"an excellent investment opportunity for just the right buyer.\"\n\nDouglas Lee, a real estate agent with Compass, told the Los Angeles Times that the home is an opportunity to \"land bank,\" or defer using the property for long time.\n\n\u201cYou sit and wait until that tenant either dies, vacates or the lease ends,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cOnce that happens, you realize a ton of your potential. That\u2019s a really good purchase for trust fund people. If you\u2019re buying it for your kid who is like zero or 1, in 18 years you know that this thing will be about ready to realize.\u201d\n\nThe relatively cheap property is contrast with the overall housing market, which has grown increasingly unaffordable, especially in places like California.\n\nNationwide, the price on sales of existing homes jumped to a fresh record high in May even as the supply increased. In addition, Zillow says buyers must now put down roughly 35%, or almost $128,000, to afford a typical home.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, high home prices are having a \"feudalizing impact\" on California, as policies that limit urban sprawl have raised land values, according to the annual Demographia International Housing Affordability report, which was produced by Chapman University in California and the Frontier Centre for Public Policy in Canada.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 15 Best Places in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security and in this article, we will talk about the Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nAI in retirement\n\nRecently, Mercer LLC carried out a survey to study the use of AI within investment management companies. According to the survey, on average, managers in 9 out of 10 firms reported that they were either using or planned to use AI in their investment processes. The same survey highlighted that even though the use of AI in asset management is widespread, it is currently restricted to augmenting existing capabilities. However, going forward, it is likely that AI will play a pivotal role in various spheres of asset management, including retirement planning.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) has highlighted how the integration of AI in retirement planning can unfold limitless opportunities for fiduciaries. Similarly, AI might also help retirees through its ability to generate personalized insights. By using AI, retirees may soon be able to adopt an investment strategy tailored to their specific needs, thus allowing them to maximize their ability to build a retirement nest egg. In fact, Vanguard has already introduced some degree of AI into its financial advice tool, Robo-Advisor.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), one of the companies at the forefront of AI integration in the finance sector, made headlines last September when it launched an internal AI model. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) introduced a language model-powered AI assistant that leverages OpenAI\u2019s technology and assists the firm\u2019s Advisors in their day-to-day activities. In April, the company released its quarterly financials, posting a revenue of $15 billion with an EPS of $2.02.\n\nThe company\u2019s wealth management segment contributed 45% of its total revenue. Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% YoY to $6.88 billion as a result of improved asset management fees. Consequently, share prices have increased significantly since the company released its Q1 earnings, rising from $89 on April 16th to $97 on May 31st.\n\nWhile we at Insider Monkey recognize the potential of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) stock and its ability to generate returns in the near future, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time-frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI and Financial Literacy\n\nAI tools that offer personalized solutions might soon revolutionize the entire retirement savings industry. One reason that AI\u2019s ability to offer personalized solutions is so valuable is they can help make up for a lack of financial literacy among Americans. Our article on Best Places in Utah for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security reveals how financial literacy can be linked to retirement wellness. Alarmingly, MassMutual claims that nearly 80% of people nearing retirement don't have a basic knowledge of Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nOne way to address a lack of financial literacy is through the use of AI financial advisors who can guide seniors through various aspects of retirement planning. Apart from helping seniors adopt a tailored investment strategy, AI tools can also help them attain maximum benefits from their pensions and social security. Forbes reports that 96% of Americans lose an average of $111,000 in their Social Security income due to errors made while filing for benefits. Thus, an AI tool capable of assessing an individual\u2019s circumstances can be invaluable to retirees as they step into their golden years.\n\nAnother reason that such tools have the potential to be so successful is that retirement plans tend to vary significantly based on personal preferences such as quality of life, duration of retirement, and location. Consequently, people often tend to underestimate the amount of money they need to save, how much of their savings they should withdraw, and when to retire in order to secure a comfortable retirement.\n\nBest Places for Retirement in America\n\nAn analysis of the real estate market in America shows that the cost of living and housing vary considerably based on geographical factors. For example, while Florida is often considered one of the best states for retirement due to factors such as weather, recreation, and tax-friendliness, housing costs in the Sunshine State are quite expensive. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) reports that the median rental cost in Florida is currently $2,500 per month, which is 17.6% higher than the national median. Thus, retirees who find themselves strapped for cash might find it more convenient to pick a more affordable retirement destination.\n\nOur articles on the best places to retire in Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Idaho highlight how some of the best places to retire in America might be in the American West. For example, Nevada is one of the Most Tax-Friendly States to Retire in. It has zero state income tax, meaning that all forms of retirement income, such as 401Ks, pensions, and social security remain untaxed. Furthermore, our list of 13 States That Don\u2019t Tax Retirement Income shows that although Nevada\u2019s sales tax rates tend to be high, average property taxes are relatively low at just 0.48%.\n\nIn addition, according to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z), the median rental price in Nevada is $2,100, just shy of the national median. There are plenty of places in the Silver State where retirees can find the right balance of comfort and affordability, even if they wish to live on only social security. Thus, for those wondering if Nevada is good for seniors to live on retirement income, join us as we look at the best places in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security. The Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security\n\nThe Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of best places in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security, we initially picked out the most recommended places in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security on the internet. We used 10+ sources including our article on Best Places to Retire in Nevada, Smart Asset, and Movoto to develop a shortlist. Further research was narrowed down to these places only.\n\nAmongst these, we developed a scorecard using metrics such as livability scores, cost of living, and average rent. Livability scores were sourced from Area Vibes while median rent was obtained from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z). By standardizing these metrics on a linear scale, each place was scored, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 15 places were chosen for our list.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nOur methodology revealed that Lovelock is the Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on only Social Security.\n\n1. Lovelock\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 11.05\n\nLivability Score: 71\n\nMedian Rent: $955\n\nIM Cost of Living: 80.9\n\nLovelock is located off Interstate Highway 80, just under a hundred miles from Reno. It is primarily an agricultural and livestock city. Although it lacks recreational value, there are a few attractions that residents can enjoy, such as the Lovelock Caves or the nearby Rye Patch State Recreation Area. What makes Lovelock the best place in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security is its incredibly low cost of living. Compared to the national average, the cost of living in the city is 21% lower. Moreover, median rent in Lovelock is $955, which is nearly 55% lower than the national median.\n\nTo learn about more places in Nevada to retire on only Social Security, check out 15 Best Places in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best online banks; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "Thinking about buying a home? You might be in for a rude awakening: a 20% down payment is no longer enough for most people to afford monthly payments\u2014not when home values are 45% higher than before the pandemic, and mortgage payments are roughly 115% higher, according to Zillow.\n\n\u201cDown payments have always been important, but in the current market, where interest rates remain high and volatile and home values are stable or rising, boosting the amount you put down can make the difference between a home that\u2019s affordable and one that\u2019s not,\u201d Zillow\u2019s chief economist, Skylar Olsen, wrote in an analysis yesterday.\n\nThe analysis, looking at major metropolitan areas, found homebuyers earning the median income need to put down 35.4%, which equates to almost $127,750, to comfortably afford payments on the typical home in America.\n\nComfortably, in this case, means you\u2019re spending no more than 30% of the typical income in your specific area on housing\u2014so your mortgage payment, property taxes, and insurance. Anyone who spends more than 30% of their income on housing is considered cost-burdened, and severely-cost burdened if housing takes up more than half their income. (In May, the value of a typical home was $360,310, and the typical monthly mortgage payment was $1,931, after a 20% down payment, per Zillow).\n\n\u201cIn more expensive markets, where home values have long outpaced incomes, middle-income households need an even bigger down payment share on top of the bigger price tag,\u201d Olsen wrote, pointing to some sunny California cities, among others.\n\nIn Los Angeles, for one, a median-income household needs to put down 81.1%, or $780,203, to afford the typical home and its monthly payments; she called that percentage, the highest in the nation, \u201cnearly impossible.\u201d In San Jose, they\u2019d need to put down 80.9%, or more than $1.3 million, \u201cwhich is more than the typical home is worth in every other major market.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, median-income households would need to come up with a more than 60% down payment, in Miami, they\u2019d need to come up with a 64.5% down payment\u2014and the list goes on.\n\n\u201cA median-income household in Seattle\u2014making around $116,000\u2014would need about $462,000 to lower the debt enough to comfortably afford the monthly payment on the typical home, worth almost $753,500,\u201d Olsen wrote. \u201cIt would take almost 24 years to build up that kind of savings if that household saved 10% of their income every month into a cash account earning a guaranteed 4% return.\u201d\n\nOlsen continued with another example: \u201cIn a more affordable market like Atlanta, a median-income household would need more than $118,000 saved for 30.5% down on the typical home in that market, currently valued at almost $387,500. That would take more than 10 years,\u201d she wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeople across the country already struggle to come up with even 20% down. The National Association of Realtors found the typical down payment in the year ending June 2023 was just 8% for first-time buyers and 19% for repeat buyers. And they often rely on outside help: Last year, 43% of buyers used a gift from family or friends for part of their down payment, according to Zillow. A separate Redfin-commissioned survey found more than a third of millennials and Gen Zers planning to buy a home expect their parents, or family, to help with their down payment.\n\nThere\u2019s only 10 out of 50 major metropolitan areas where a household earning the median income can put less than 20% down and still have an \u201caffordable\u201d payment on the typical home, Zillow found. \u201cMost are in the Midwest, where home values have largely grown at a strong clip in recent years,\u201d Olsen wrote.\n\nAustin, Jacksonville, Charlotte, and Raleigh are others where a median-income household can put 20% down. \u201cThe relative affordability of these markets is a big reason why many of them were boom markets during the pandemic, and likely will be into the future,\u201d she wrote. If so, they may not be considered affordable for much longer.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Zillow Economist Admits 'We Are In A Big Hole' As U.S. Housing Shortage Hits 4.5 Million Despite Construction Efforts\n\nNewly released data from Zillow reveals that despite a surge in construction, the U.S. housing market has failed to keep pace with growing demand, resulting in a national deficit of 4.5 million homes.\r\n\r\nAmid a backdrop of two-decade high mortgage rates and home prices ebbing around record highs that helped trigger an affordability crisis affecting millions, Zillow senior economist Orphe Divounguy is calling for aggressive and transformative housing policies.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? The average millionaire has 7 sources of income. Here are 3 passive income opportunities you can add today.\n\n\"The simple fact is there are not enough homes in this country, and that\u2019s pushing homeownership out of reach for too many families,\" Divounguy said in a news release noting the 4.5 million home shortage. \"Filling the housing shortage is the long-term answer to making housing more affordable.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Zillow, the housing market is driven simply by supply and demand. As more individuals seek to purchase homes than the market can supply, housing prices inevitably rise.\n\nHowever, the current market isn't a normal one.\r\n\r\nThe negative situation in the housing market had been brewing in the years following the Great Recession as millennials, the largest generation in U.S. history, entered their prime homebuying years, leading to an escalation in home affordability issues.\n\nCompounding the issue, despite a construction boom during the COVID-era, efforts to meet housing demand have fallen short. In 2022, although it was the most productive year for home construction since the early 2000s, just 1.4 million homes were completed. In 2023, roughly 1.45 million homes were completed.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. That new construction still did not match the pace of family formation, Zillow said.\r\n\r\n\"We are in a big hole,\" the senior economist noted. \"And it is going to take more than the status quo to dig ourselves out of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe outsized discrepancy between family formation and new home construction indicates two things: Supply was insufficient to accommodate the new demand, and it wasn't enough to address the long-standing deficit that had already been affecting the affordability crisis for over a decade.\r\n\r\nExperts agree that zoning laws, which prevent some areas from allowing more density, are part of the supply issue.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It seems straightforward: We need to build more homes,\" Zillow chief economist Dr. Skylar Olsen said in the company's Home Price Expectations survey. \"Changes through policies like modest densification will give us more \u2018at bats' to create density and help communities stay livable for everyone.\"\n\nTrending: Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos only needs $100 to get started.\n\nEssentially, cities with historically higher incomes and more expensive housing markets often have stricter zoning laws, which restrict the supply of housing and keep homeownership out of reach for many.\n\nDespite mortgage rates over 7%, Zillow found that an estimated 7.9 million renting families could realistically afford to take on a mortgage \u2014 this is called being \u2018mortgage-ready'.\r\n\r\nHowever, because they live in highly regulated markets, even those who are \u2018mortgage ready' are forced to rent.\r\n\r\n\"Without a huge injection of new homes in the near future, affordability will continue to be a challenge for many \u2014 especially first-time homebuyers,\" Olsen said.\r\n\r\nPresident Joe Biden issued a budget in March that aims to build two million affordable homes and establish an \u2018innovation\u2019 fund to help communities build and renovate housing, as well as convert office spaces into homes.\r\n\r\n\"We have to build, build, build,\" Biden tweeted then. \"That\u2019s how we bring down costs for good.\"\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nNo generation before Gen Z has had this investment opportunity \u2013 How successful Zoomers plan to retire in their 30's. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Zillow Economist Admits 'We Are In A Big Hole' As U.S. Housing Shortage Hits 4.5 Million Despite Construction Efforts originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "To afford a monthly mortgage payment, middle-class Americans need to put more than $127,000 down",
        "content": "Forty-three percent of last year's home buyers used a gift from family or friends to help with their down payment, the most since at least 2018\n\nA median-income household would need to put 35.4% down to afford the payments on a typical U.S. home. Five years ago, the typical U.S. home would have been affordable to a median-income household with no money down. A typical home is affordable to a median-income household with 20% down or less in 10 of the 50 biggest U.S. markets.\n\nSEATTLE, June 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- To comfortably afford a typical U.S. home, a home buyer making the median income needs to put down nearly $127,750, or 35.4%, a new Zillow\u00ae analysis shows. Five years ago, when mortgage rates were hovering just above 4% and the typical home was worth about 50% less, that home would have been affordable with no money down. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nThat $127,750 down payment is what a household making the median income would need to put down when purchasing a typical U.S. home \u2014 valued at about $360,000 \u2014 so that the monthly mortgage payments take up no more than 30% of that household's monthly income.1\n\nThe enormous gap between the down payment needed now and five years ago underscores how the pandemic fueled a scorching-hot housing market, and why the rise in mortgage rates in the time since has cooled the market. Stubbornly high mortgage rates have pushed both buyers and sellers to the sidelines. With so few homes for sale, competition is stiff among the remaining buyers.\n\n\"Down payments have always been important, but even more so today. With so few available, buyers may have to wait even longer for the right home to hit the market, especially now that buyers can afford less. Mortgage rate movements during that time could make the difference between affording that home and not,\" said Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow. \"Saving enough is a tall task without outside help \u2014 a gift from family or perhaps a stock windfall. To make the finances work, some folks are making a big move across the country, co-buying or buying a home with an extra room to rent out. Down payment assistance is another great resource that is too often overlooked.\"\n\nTo save up $127,750, it would take a household making the median income about 12 years (assuming its members save 10% of their income each month with a 4% annual return). It's no wonder then that 43% of last year's buyers used a gift from family or friends for at least part of their down payment, the highest share since at least 2018.\n\nThere are still affordable pockets of the U.S. In 10 major metropolitan areas, the typical home is affordable to a median-income household with less than 20% down. Pittsburgh boasts the most affordable housing market. A median-income household there could afford the monthly payments on a typical home even with no money down.\n\nStory continues\n\nCalifornia is on the other end of the affordability spectrum. A median-income household in San Jose would need to put down more than $1.3 million to afford the mortgage payments on a typical home \u2014 that's more than the typical home is worth in every other major market. In Los Angeles, a median-income household would need an 81.1% down payment ($780,203) to afford the typical home, the highest in the country. This helps explain why many California metros have seen population losses since 2020, as long-distance movers target areas with more affordable housing.\n\nFor those who qualify, down payment assistance can amplify savings and help a buyer enter homeownership more quickly. In Minneapolis, for example, the average amount of down payment assistance available across the metro is just under $22,750, according to data from Down Payment Resource. A median-income buyer in Minneapolis without down payment assistance would need a 27% down payment to comfortably afford the typical home. With $22,750 in down payment assistance, they would need to put 21% down.\n\n\"Homeownership is the primary source of net worth and generational wealth for most Americans, and declining affordability is making it harder for average earners to get their foot in the door of an entry-level home. Luckily, there are more than 2,373 down payment assistance programs nationwide with at least one program in every county and 10 or more programs available in 2,000 counties,\" said Down Payment Resource Founder and CEO Rob Chrane. \"In fact, down payment assistance providers have responded to the difficult housing market by increasing the number of programs offered and expanding inventory options with support for manufactured homes and owner-occupied multi-unit homes.\"\n\nEvery for-sale listing on Zillow displays available down payment assistance programs that a buyer may qualify for.\n\nMetro Area* Typical \r\nHome Value Down Payment \r\nNeeded ($) Down Payment \r\nNeeded (%) Years to \r\nSave** Average Down \r\nPayment Assistance*** United States $360,681 $127,743 35.4\u00a0% 12.0 ~$17,000 New York, NY $657,279 $494,795 75.3\u00a0% 27.4 $23,660 Los Angeles, CA $962,388 $780,203 81.1\u00a0% 36.3 $42,446 Chicago, IL $321,897 $95,953 29.8\u00a0% 8.8 $9,811 Dallas, TX $381,104 $152,586 40.0\u00a0% 12.9 $12,670 Houston, TX $310,707 $76,825 24.7\u00a0% 7.9 $10,618 Washington, DC $568,862 $188,087 33.1\u00a0% 11.2 $20,161 Philadelphia, PA $362,204 $103,471 28.6\u00a0% 9.2 $12,690 Miami, FL $490,088 $316,270 64.5\u00a0% 24.1 $20,623 Atlanta, GA $387,471 $118,239 30.5\u00a0% 10.1 $10,796 Boston, MA $701,349 $432,875 61.7\u00a0% 23.1 $28,359 Phoenix, AZ $461,352 $186,012 40.3\u00a0% 14.8 $21,444 San Francisco, CA $1,183,272 $887,656 75.0\u00a0% 31.5 $58,035 Riverside, CA $584,710 $358,926 61.4\u00a0% 23.6 $32,312 Detroit, MI $254,325 $24,132 9.5\u00a0% 2.8 $11,479 Seattle, WA $753,414 $462,095 61.3\u00a0% 23.7 $26,533 Minneapolis, MN $378,924 $102,199 27.0\u00a0% 8.6 $22,738 San Diego, CA $958,266 $723,527 75.5\u00a0% 32.5 $41,377 Tampa, FL $382,802 $181,195 47.3\u00a0% 16.6 $14,414 Denver, CO $595,649 $300,970 50.5\u00a0% 18.7 N/A Baltimore, MD $387,914 $100,641 25.9\u00a0% 8.5 $9,910 St. Louis, MO $253,559 $10,773 4.2\u00a0% 1.2 $8,315 Orlando, FL $398,881 $192,533 48.3\u00a0% 17.0 $16,755 Charlotte, NC $386,371 $149,041 38.6\u00a0% 13.7 $12,372 San Antonio, TX $289,511 $92,158 31.8\u00a0% 9.7 $11,885 Portland, OR $556,385 $296,427 53.3\u00a0% 19.8 $27,560 Sacramento, CA $586,875 $337,769 57.6\u00a0% 21.7 $29,044 Pittsburgh, PA $217,285 $0 0\u00a0% $8,157 Cincinnati, OH $287,721 $59,573 20.7\u00a0% 6.4 $10,711 Austin, TX $466,628 $209,333 44.9\u00a0% 14.7 $15,303 Las Vegas, NV $427,509 $198,306 46.4\u00a0% 17.6 $18,479 Kansas City, MO $307,032 $76,273 24.8\u00a0% 7.9 $11,526 Columbus, OH $315,438 $84,215 26.7\u00a0% 8.5 $12,357 Indianapolis, IN $282,396 $27,570 9.8\u00a0% 3.1 $10,967 Cleveland, OH $230,536 $31,551 13.7\u00a0% 4.0 $9,524 San Jose, CA $1,631,252 $1,320,275 80.9\u00a0% 36.2 $63,407 Nashville, TN $446,180 $203,325 45.6\u00a0% 16.7 $17,620 Virginia Beach, VA $351,095 $112,962 32.2\u00a0% 10.9 $10,217 Providence, RI $481,911 $257,453 53.4\u00a0% 19.0 $22,792 Jacksonville, FL $361,796 $116,974 32.3\u00a0% 10.8 $12,700 Milwaukee, WI $348,439 $137,086 39.3\u00a0% 13.4 $10,483 Oklahoma City, OK $235,815 $31,331 13.3\u00a0% 3.9 $9,442 Raleigh, NC $449,514 $152,410 33.9\u00a0% 11.8 $16,814 Memphis, TN $242,519 $30,852 12.7\u00a0% 4.1 $9,075 Richmond, VA $372,080 $105,228 28.3\u00a0% 9.6 $10,896 Louisville, KY $258,557 $46,869 18.1\u00a0% 5.7 $10,935 New Orleans, LA $241,940 $46,138 19.1\u00a0% 6.0 $12,998 Salt Lake City, UT $549,373 $251,131 45.7\u00a0% 17.1 $19,751 Hartford, CT $362,763 $129,585 35.7\u00a0% 11.0 N/A Buffalo, NY $262,616 N/A N/A N/A $14,273 Birmingham, AL $255,033 $19,406 7.6\u00a0% 2.4 N/A\n\n*Table ordered by market size **Assuming a household saves 10% of its income each month with a 4% annual return ***Source: Down Payment Resource.

        "title": "The U.S. is now short 4.5 million homes as the housing deficit grows",
        "content": "The growing housing shortage is the primary reason for the affordability crisis\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022, the U.S. housing shortage grew to 4.5 million homes, up from 4.3 million. In 2022, the number of U.S. families increased by 1.8 million, while only 1.4 million housing units were built. Those who live in markets with stricter land-use regulations are less likely to be able to afford the mortgage payment on a typical home.\n\nSEATTLE, June 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite a pandemic construction boom, the U.S housing shortage grew to 4.5 million homes in 2022, up from 4.3 million the year before, according to a new analysis from Zillow\u00ae.1 This deepening housing deficit is the root cause of the housing affordability crisis. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nAt its core, the housing market is driven by supply and demand. When the number of people who want a home increases faster than the number of homes available, prices go up. This balance reached a tipping point when the Great Recession ushered in a decade of underbuilding and millennials \u2014 the biggest generation in U.S. history \u2014 reaching the prime age for first-time home buying. The result has been worsening affordability, now exacerbated by stubbornly high mortgage rates.\n\n\"The simple fact is there are not enough homes in this country, and that's pushing homeownership out of reach for too many families,\" said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. \"The affordability crisis extends to renters as well, with nearly half of renter households being cost burdened. Filling the housing shortage is the long-term answer to making housing more affordable. We are in a big hole, and it is going to take more than the status quo to dig ourselves out of it.\"\n\nAcross the country in 2022, there were roughly 8.09 million \"missing households\" \u2014 individuals or families living with nonrelatives. Compare that to 3.55 million housing units that were available for rent or for sale, and there is a housing shortage of more than 4.5 million.\n\nThe pandemic-era housing frenzy sparked a construction boom, but thus far, that boom has fallen short. In 2022, 1.4 million homes were built \u2014 at the time, the best year for home construction since the early stages of the Great Recession. However, the number of U.S. families increased by 1.8 million that year, meaning the country did not even build enough to make a place for the new families, let alone begin chipping away at the deficit that has hampered housing affordability for more than a decade.\n\nOne indicator of housing affordability is how strict a region's land-use rules are, new Zillow research shows. Those who live in highly regulated housing markets, as defined by the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index, are less likely to be able to afford the mortgage payment on a typical home in their metro, even in markets with higher-than-average incomes. This is because housing supply persistently falls short.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's ahead According to the U.S. Census Bureau, roughly 1.45 million homes were completed in 2023. The increase over 2022 is a sign of progress, but much more needs to be done.\n\nReforming zoning rules to allow for more density is key for more homes to be built. Experts overwhelmingly agree that relaxing zoning laws is one of the best ways to improve affordability, and these types of measures have broad support among homeowners and renters. Even adding a modest amount of density in the country's biggest markets could create millions of new homes.\n\nMore steps in the right direction include eliminating or reducing parking requirements and minimizing delays in approval of building permits.\n\nMetro Area* Housing \r\nShortage \r\n(2022) Change in Housing \r\nShortage YoY (#) Change in Housing \r\nShortage YoY (%) Share of Non-Homeowner \r\nHouseholds That Could \r\nAfford Typical Mortgage United States 4,540,773 256,847 6.0\u00a0% 15.1\u00a0% New York, NY 389,924 13,548 3.6\u00a0% 9.3\u00a0% Los Angeles, CA 336,728 2,866 0.9\u00a0% 2.8\u00a0% Chicago, IL 97,379 9,946 11.4\u00a0% 22.0\u00a0% Dallas, TX 48,150 528 1.1\u00a0% 14.5\u00a0% Houston, TX 20,028 3,631 22.1\u00a0% 18.5\u00a0% Washington, DC 132,380 -1,591 -1.2\u00a0% 13.0\u00a0% Philadelphia, PA 72,584 7,795 12.0\u00a0% 17.2\u00a0% Miami, FL 66,944 6,887 11.5\u00a0% 9.2\u00a0% Atlanta, GA 65,543 2,076 3.3\u00a0% 13.7\u00a0% Boston, MA 154,985 3,220 2.1\u00a0% 7.0\u00a0% Phoenix, AZ 93,984 6,988 8.0\u00a0% 6.8\u00a0% San Francisco, CA 151,491 -10,090 -6.2\u00a0% 3.7\u00a0% Riverside, CA 76,988 4,634 6.4\u00a0% 5.5\u00a0% Detroit, MI 34,772 -387 -1.1\u00a0% 23.1\u00a0% Seattle, WA 107,897 -961 -0.9\u00a0% 5.5\u00a0% Minneapolis, MN 77,560 965 1.3\u00a0% 12.0\u00a0% San Diego, CA 93,939 -555 -0.6\u00a0% 2.6\u00a0% Tampa, FL 31,342 3,255 11.6\u00a0% 10.8\u00a0% Denver, CO 70,197 504 0.7\u00a0% 5.1\u00a0% Baltimore, MD 36,808 2,681 7.9\u00a0% 16.0\u00a0% St. Louis, MO 14,824 1,647 12.5\u00a0% 22.6\u00a0% Orlando, FL 21,528 6,173 40.2\u00a0% 11.1\u00a0% Charlotte, NC 18,494 689 3.9\u00a0% 12.8\u00a0% San Antonio, TX 15,778 1,141 7.8\u00a0% 15.3\u00a0% Portland, OR 72,284 -4,433 -5.8\u00a0% 5.1\u00a0% Sacramento, CA 62,724 -1,025 -1.6\u00a0% 4.9\u00a0% Pittsburgh, PA 15,632 -1,462 -8.6\u00a0% 25.6\u00a0% Cincinnati, OH 32,281 1,249 4.0\u00a0% 18.2\u00a0% Austin, TX 61,332 4,587 8.1\u00a0% 7.3\u00a0% Las Vegas, NV 29,075 2,619 9.9\u00a0% 8.4\u00a0% Kansas City, MO 27,579 1,219 4.6\u00a0% 19.5\u00a0% Columbus, OH 34,979 1,580 4.7\u00a0% 17.9\u00a0% Indianapolis, IN 14,675 468 3.3\u00a0% 18.3\u00a0% Cleveland, OH 15,383 1,763 12.9\u00a0% 22.4\u00a0% San Jose, CA 57,556 -3,339 -5.5\u00a0% 2.7\u00a0% Nashville, TN 35,985 1,076 3.1\u00a0% 7.2\u00a0% Virginia Beach, VA 18,843 1,254 7.1\u00a0% 15.9\u00a0% Providence, RI 26,473 3,867 17.1\u00a0% 7.7\u00a0% Jacksonville, FL 14,250 -123 -0.9\u00a0% 11.8\u00a0% Milwaukee, WI 14,906 2,144 16.8\u00a0% 14.4\u00a0% Oklahoma City, OK 13,970 2,301 19.7\u00a0% 22.5\u00a0% Raleigh, NC 11,731 -5,245 -30.9\u00a0% 9.9\u00a0% Memphis, TN 3,350 252 8.1\u00a0% 20.6\u00a0% Richmond, VA 16,363 974 6.3\u00a0% 15.0\u00a0% Louisville, KY 9,963 1,912 23.7\u00a0% 20.0\u00a0% New Orleans, LA 4,204 1,192 39.6\u00a0% 16.4\u00a0% Salt Lake City, UT 29,955 1,857 6.6\u00a0% 3.8\u00a0% Hartford, CT 13,222 -223 -1.7\u00a0% 18.1\u00a0% Buffalo, NY 15,201 1,860 13.9\u00a0% 17.1\u00a0% Birmingham, AL 4,041 804 24.8\u00a0% 17.6\u00a0%\n\n* Table ordered by market size\n\nAbout Zillow Group: Zillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 15 Best Places to Retire in New Mexico and in this article, we will talk about the Best Place to Retire in New Mexico.\n\nRetirement in New Mexico\n\nAt face value, New Mexico isn\u2019t exactly the best state to retire in. Studies show that the state consistently ranks as one of the worst in terms of alcohol and drug-related deaths. The state ranks 43rd on the emotional and physical well-being scale and had a violent crime rate of 780.5 per 100,000 people in 2022, making it the most dangerous state in the US. Despite this, data from U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL) revealed that New Mexico ranked fairly high as one of the top growth states where people are moving to. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL) calculated these growth states by each state's net gain (or loss) of one-way equipment from customer transactions in 2023. According to U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL), New Mexico was outranked by neighboring states such as Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. However, it still managed to be ranked 16th overall among US states, indicating that the perception that New Mexico is a bad place to retire might not be true.\n\nOne of the pros of retiring in New Mexico is its weather. Residents can expect plenty of sunny days each year, along with chilly winters. Its warm climate provides the perfect weather for residents to explore its rich cultural heritage and numerous national parks. Its abundance of nature and comfortable weather are important reasons why it boasts one of the most active and healthiest populations among all states. In terms of taxes, New Mexico is one of the States That Tax Social Security in 2024. However, all single filers with income under $100,000 and couples with income under $150,000 are exempted from social security taxes. Other forms of retirement income remain taxable, including 401Ks and pensions. However, retirees looking to own their own homes will be glad to know that New Mexico has one of the lowest property taxes in the US.\n\nIn addition to a low property tax, home prices in the state are relatively affordable. Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) reports that the current median home price in the US is approximately $439,716. In comparison, the median home price for Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) listings in New Mexico is $358,800. Although there is no sales tax in the state, there is a gross receipts tax levied on businesses that gets passed on to the consumers. Despite this, our IM cost of living index shows that the cost of living in New Mexico is 99.2% of the national average, making it a moderately tax-friendly and affordable retirement destination.\n\nStory continues\n\nRetirement Financing\n\nTo determine whether New Mexico is the right retirement destination, one must consider various factors, one of which is retirement financing. Our article on Best Small Towns to Retire highlights that in addition to saving accounts like 401(k)s & IRAs, investing in stocks is an effective strategy for building a nest egg. In addition, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) claims that individuals can achieve a 22% increase in retirement spending when they embed guaranteed retirement income solutions into a target date fund.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) recently launched its LifePath Paycheck solution which offers a guaranteed retirement income using an investment strategy that is tailored to a target retirement date. The solution was launched in late April, just weeks after CEO and Chairman, Larry Fink, warned of an impending retirement crisis in the company\u2019s annual chairman\u2019s letter to its investors. With the rollout of its LifePath Paycheck, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) aims to revolutionize retirement planning and cement its place as the world's largest asset management firm.\n\nLast month, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $5.10 per share of common stock which would be paid on the 24th of June. This was announced following an impressive Q1 performance in which the company generated an 11% YoY increase in revenue and long-term net inflows of $76 billion. The increase in revenue was spurred by a $1.4 trillion increase in AUM volume to a record $10.5 trillion, driven by consistent organic growth and positive market movements.\n\nWhile we at Insider Monkey recognize the potential of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) stock and its ability to consistently generate returns & dividends, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

You may also find our articles on nearby states such as Utah, Oklahoma, and Colorado to be extremely insightful. The Best Place to Retire in New Mexico\n\nBest Place to Retire in New Mexico\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of the best places to retire in New Mexico, we initially picked out the most recommended places to retire in New Mexico on the internet. We used 10+ sources, such as our own lists, and external sources such as NASDAQ and Movoto to develop a shortlist. Further research was narrowed down to these places only.\n\nAmong these best places to retire in New Mexico, we developed a scorecard using metrics such as livability scores, air & water quality, cost of living, median rent, and median home prices. Livability scores were sourced from Area Vibes while median rent and median home prices were obtained from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) and Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) respectively. By standardizing these metrics on a linear scale, each place was scored, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 15 places were chosen as the best places to retire in New Mexico.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nOur methodology revealed that Silver City is the best place to retire in New Mexico.\n\n1. Silver City\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 29.84\n\nLivability Score: 76\n\nMedian Home Price: $257,000\n\nAverage Rent: $975\n\nIM Cost of Living: 82.1\n\nIM Air & Water Quality Score: 79\n\nSilver City is located approximately 50 miles east of the Arizona - New Mexico state border, and approximately 70 miles north of the US - Mexico national border. Although not the most affordable destination on our list, the cost of living in the city is well below the state average and 82.1% of the national average. Moreover, with a median home price of $257K, owning a home is comparatively affordable. Apart from its affordability, it is the perfect destination to enrich your retirement with nature. The Gila National Forest creates the perfect backdrop for residents to immerse themselves amidst lakes, springs, and wildlife. Moreover, the town center features several art galleries and museums, meaning there is an abundance of excursions to enrich your golden years.\n\nCheck out our complete list of best places to retire in New Mexico.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire in New Mexico to the best AI travel apps; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "After sitting on the sidelines for months, sellers finally want to offload their houses, but no one\u2019s buying",
        "content": "Fortuneonce called the historically low mortgage rates of the pandemic era a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s true\u2014there\u2019s nothing better than a below-market rate, especially when there\u2019s such a substantial difference, but it keeps you locked in, too; it\u2019s hard to give up a, let\u2019s say, 3% mortgage rate for a 7% one, unless you have no other choice.\n\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon called the lock-in effect, and all year it has shown subtle signs of easing. Last year, existing home sales fell to their lowest point in almost three decades because nobody was selling or buying homes. But it seems sellers are finally ready; the only thing is, buyers aren\u2019t matching their energy. \u201cHome sellers are returning to the market but finding buyers hesitating,\u201d Zillow\u2019s chief economist Skylar Olsen wrote in a monthly housing report published yesterday.\n\n\u201cBuyers aren\u2019t matching sellers\u2019 uptick in activity,\u201d Olsen reiterated. But how do we know sellers are making a comeback? New listings rose roughly 8% in May and close to 13% from a year earlier. \u201cThe effects of \u2018rate lock,\u2019 owners holding on to their existing homes and low-rate mortgages, appear to be lessening over time, even as most outstanding mortgages have a rate well below what\u2019s currently being quoted on the market,\u201d she wrote.\n\nStill, there were fewer sales in May than last year; they were down 6%, according to Zillow. Separately, according to a Redfin analysis published today, pending home sales are down 3.5% from a year earlier, which is the biggest decline in more than three months, and its homebuyer demand index, which considers requests for tours and other services from Redfin agents, is down 18% (the lowest since February).\n\nEither way, Olsen said, the drop in sales volume helped with a sort of housing restock: The number of homes for sale rose 22% from a year earlier, when it was near an all-time low, and total inventory is at its smallest deficit in three years\u2014which basically means it\u2019s still a ways away from pre-pandemic levels, about 34% less, per Zillow.\n\nCompetition wasn\u2019t as intense last month, so home price appreciation cooled. In April, home values rose 4.4% from a year earlier, but in May, they rose 3.9% (the monthly increase was lower, too). Slower home price appreciation is great for anyone who wants to buy a home, but home prices are still 45% higher than they were before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cZillow\u2019s Market Heat Index shows the nation is becoming a bit friendlier for buyers and is headed toward \u2018neutral\u2019 territory, but sellers still hold a slight advantage,\u201d Olsen wrote. \u201cBuffalo, Hartford, and San Jose are the top markets for sellers among the 50 largest metro areas. New Orleans, Miami, Jacksonville, and Memphis are all tilted toward buyers, giving those in the market better leverage in negotiations.\u201d And nationally, almost a quarter of homes for sale slashed prices, which is the greatest share in the past six years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a much different, more costly landscape for people who want to buy homes. On a monthly basis, home prices are up in all 50 major metropolitan areas, and on an annual basis, they\u2019re up in 46 metros, per Zillow. We already know home prices are considerably higher since the start of the pandemic; monthly mortgage payments are, too. The typical monthly mortgage payment is 11.3% higher than last year, and ready for this\u2014115.3% since before the pandemic. So not only is the housing world more costly than last year, it\u2019s a completely different entity from four years ago. It\u2019s not hard to imagine why buyers are backing off.\n\nMortgage rates have come down a bit; daily rates are at 6.97% (their lowest in three months on the back of yesterday\u2019s consumer price index report), and weekly rates are at 6.95%. Home price appreciation has slowed as well, according to Zillow. So maybe things will start to look up for would-be buyers?\n\n\u201cThe latest inflation report is good for homebuyers because it has already sent mortgage rates down, though this week\u2019s Fed meeting will temper mortgage-rate declines,\u201d Redfin\u2019s economic research lead Chen Zhao said in the analysis. \u201cBut on the other side of the coin, if lower mortgage rates bring back more demand than supply, that could erase the possibility that home-price growth softens, and push prices up even further. Lower rates and higher prices may ultimately cancel each other out when it comes to homebuyers\u2019 monthly payments.\u201d\n\nStill, if anything, the housing world is moving toward a balance of sorts, Zillow\u2019s Olsen wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Bulls Push Wall Street To Record Highs On Declining Inflation; Tech, Real Estate, Small Caps Surge Ahead Of Fed Meeting: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nA lower-than-expected inflation report for May ignited a bullish frenzy on Wall Street, with investors increasing their bets on rate cuts, bolstered by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will ease its policy stance later this year as price pressures trend towards the 2% target.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed cooler-than-anticipated monthly and annual inflation rates for both headline and core items.\n\nThis report arrives just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will commence at 2:00 p.m. ET today.\n\nThe implied probability of a rate cut by September has surged to 72%, up from 54% before the inflation report. Fed futures now indicate a 55 basis points reduction (equivalent to two rate cuts) by year-end.\n\nIn response to rising expectations for rate cuts, traders quickly pivoted to riskier assets.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4% to over 19,400 points, setting new record highs. The S&P 500 Index increased by 1.1% to surpass 5,400 points, also achieving fresh all-time highs.\n\nBlue-chip stocks saw a modest rise of 0.2%, but the standout performance came from small caps. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) surged 2.7%, marking its best session since mid-December 2023.\n\nTreasury yields plummeted across the board, with the 2-year yield dropping 15 basis points to 4.68%. Long-dated yields also declined by approximately 10 basis points, propelling the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) up by 1.6%, its strongest one-day performance since early February 2024.\n\nIndustries sensitive to interest rates saw significant gains. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB) and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) soared 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nPrecious metals also rallied on the back of lower yields and a weakening dollar, with gold rising 0.8% and silver surging 2.8%.\n\nCryptocurrencies experienced sharp rallies driven by the risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped 3.6% to $69,800, while the more speculative Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) surged over 8% on the day.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,072.95 2.6% Nasdaq 100 19,471.20 1.4% S&P 500 5,435.07 1.1% Dow Jones 38,819.58 0.2%\n\nUpdated at 12:15 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 1.1% higher to $542.76. The\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA)\u00a0was 0.2% higher to $388.81. The tech-heavy\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust (ARCA: QQQ) was 1.4 higher to $474.65. Sector-wise, the\u00a0TechnologySelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK)\u00a0outperformed, up by 2.6%, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) lagged, down 0.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 4.7%, surpassing Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) as the world\u2019s biggest company. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied over 4%, following Cathie Wood\u2019s bullish projection on the EV maker. The top performers among real estate stocks were Zillow Group Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), eXp World Holdings Inc.

        "title": "Homeowners list while buyers hang back, pushing inventory higher",
        "content": "Home value growth eases along with competition \u2013 price relief may be on the horizon\n\nHomeowners are breaking free from rate lock \u2014 new listings rose nearly 13% since last year. Inventory is accumulating, rising 22% over last year and reducing the pandemic-era deficit. Home value appreciation slowed in May, and forecast points to prices easing over the next year.\n\nSEATTLE, June 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Home sellers are returning to the market, but they're finding buyers hesitating, according to the latest Zillow\u00ae market report.1 New listings of houses outpaced sales in May, allowing buyer competition and price growth to cool \u2014 and further price relief is in the forecast. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"Rate lock's hold seems to be loosening \u2014 homeowners who may have put off listing their homes are done waiting. But just as more choices sprang up for sale, buyers turned on cruise control,\" said Orphe Divounguy, Zillow senior economist. \"Inflation has hit younger households hardest, and stubbornly high rates have pushed a mortgage out of reach for many first-time buyers. That has cooled competition for houses. If these trends hold, we're likely to see price growth flatten or tick down over the next year.\"\n\nInventory infusion New listings from sellers took a larger-than-average step up, rising 8% from April to May, and now stands 13% above last year's extremely low level. The effects of \"rate lock\" \u2014 when owners hold onto their existing homes and low-rate mortgages \u2014 are weakening over time. A Zillow survey of recent sellers found a large majority (about 80%) were influenced by life events, such as getting married or having a child, and not necessarily by optimal financial conditions.\n\nBut buyers aren't matching sellers' enthusiasm; sales in May were 6% lower than last year.2 This helped partially restock the housing shelves, with the number of homes on the market rising 22% compared to last year's near record-low level. Inventory is still 34% below pre-pandemic norms, but that's the smallest deficit in more than three years.\n\nNew listings rose the most annually on the West Coast and coastal South, in San Diego, Seattle, Charlotte, Raleigh and the San Francisco Bay Area. Compared to last year, total inventory accumulated the most in major Florida markets, where strong new construction has helped refill the coffers. Buyers saw more listings month over month in every major market except Miami.\n\nCompetition and appreciation ease As a result, competition among buyers eased in May, and home price appreciation cooled with it. Growth in typical home values slowed from 4.4% year over year in April to 3.9% in May \u2014 still a healthy, normal rate \u2014 while monthly appreciation ticked down from 1.2% in April to 0.8% in May. Home values are still up significantly \u2014 more than 45% \u2014 since before the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrices have fallen year over year in New Orleans, Austin and San Antonio, while appreciation is strongest in the Northeast and coastal California.\n\nRenters struggling to save up for a down payment may get a slight reprieve in the coming year. Zillow forecasts home values will end 2024 up 0.4% on the year, and tick down 1.4% through May 2025.\n\nWhat it means for buyers and sellers Zillow's market heat index shows the nation is becoming a bit friendlier for buyers and is headed toward \"neutral\" territory, but sellers still hold a slight advantage. Buffalo, Hartford and San Jose are the top markets for sellers among the 50 largest metro areas. New Orleans, Miami, Jacksonville and Memphis are all tilted toward buyers, giving those in the market better leverage in negotiations.\n\nNationwide, nearly one-quarter of all homes for sale received a price cut in May, the highest share in the past six years for this time of year. There's a good chance that buyers can purchase a lingering property for less than list price. This environment makes experienced agents all the more valuable for both buyers and sellers, to find and negotiate deals for buyers, and to price and market properties correctly for sellers.\n\nSize

        "content": "Multiple signs are indicating that the U.S. economy\u2019s \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest rates are starting to take a greater toll on the country\u2019s housing market. First, last month the number of homes for sale whose prices were reduced came in at nearly 278,000, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat represented the highest level since October 2022. Secondly, in related news, the number of homes listed for sale soared 30% in April compared with the same period a year earlier. And in April Barron\u2019snoted that existing home sales reached \u201ca near-30-year low in 2023 as costs rose.\u201d The publication added that the continued, elevated interest rates could cause sales volumes to drop further this year.\n\nSuch a development would weigh on the demand for many goods, ranging from appliances to home-improvement products to some raw materials. Here are three stocks for investors to sell and/or short amid the U.S. housing market\u2019s malaise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhirlpool (WHR) The Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate building. Whirlpool layoffs.\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhirlpool (NYSE:WHR) is being hit hard already by the weak volume of home sales. In the first quarter, the appliance maker\u2019s top line fell 3.4% versus the same period a year earlier to $4.49 billion, while the earnings per share of its continuing operations sank a huge 33% year-over-year to $1.78. Moreover, the EBIT of the firm\u2019s North American unit tumbled 49% YOY to $135 million.\n\nAlso, discouragingly, well-known multi-billionaire investor David Tepper unloaded his entire stake in WHR stock last quarter. Furthermore, back in February, Whirlpool was the most shorted company in the entire S&P 500. I believe that, in this case, the short sellers are right because the firm is indeed performing woefully as the U.S. real estate market struggles.\n\nThat makes sense because not only is the firm likely being hurt by low home sales volumes which results in fewer new homeowners updating their appliances, but high interest rates are also likely probably preventing many existing homeowners from buying new appliances.\n\nZillow Group (Z) zillow app icon on a mobile phone\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn May 1, Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z), which provides services to real estate agents, provided weaker-than-expected Q2 guidance. Specifically, the firm now expects its sales for the quarter to come in at $525 million to $540 million, versus analysts\u2019 mean outlook at the time of $559.6 million. What\u2019s more, it anticipated that it would generate EBITDA, excluding certain items, of $85 million to $100 million, well below the mean e4stimate at the time of $130 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd in negative news for the whole real estate sector and housing market, the firm expects total transaction volumes within U.S. residential real estate to be flat during the current quarter. That would mark a deceleration from the 4% year-over-year growth seen in Q1. And in Q1, its net loss rose to $23 million versus its $22 million loss in Q1 of 2023.\n\nGiven the significant macro issues that Zillow is facing, the YOY increase of its net loss in Q1, and its weaker-than-expected Q2 guidance the firm\u2019s current forward price-earnings ratio of 55.9 times is far too high.\n\nAs a result, I definitely view Z stock as being in the group of stocks to sell and/or short.\n\nOpendoor Technologies (OPEN) A picture of the OpenDoor (OPEN stock) app on a phone.\n\nSource: PREMIO STOCK/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe pressure on the housing market that I described in my introduction is going to make life significantly harder for home flipper Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN). And the company has already been struggling mightily this year.\n\nSpecifically, in Q1, its top line plunged 61% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.2 billion, while its gross profit plummeted to $114 million last quarter compared with $170 million in Q1 of 2023. And for the full year, Opendoor expects to generate a large EBITDA loss, excluding certain items, of $25 million to $35 million.\n\nIn March, Opendoor CEO Carrie Wheeler admitted that home buyer demand has decreased. With that trend, as I explained in my introduction, intensifying, the company\u2019s financial results are likely to deteriorate further going forward.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gives OPEN stock a dismal Composite Rating of 23 out of a possible 99. Additionally, the shares have a horrible Relative Strength rating of 9 out of 99, indicating that they\u2019ve performed extremely poorly over the past year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) investors are sitting on a loss of 64% if they invested three years ago",
        "content": "Investing in stocks inevitably means buying into some companies that perform poorly. But the last three years have been particularly tough on longer term Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZG) shareholders. Sadly for them, the share price is down 64% in that time. Furthermore, it's down 24% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nView our latest analysis for Zillow Group\n\nBecause Zillow Group made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.\n\nIn the last three years Zillow Group saw its revenue shrink by 14% per year. That is not a good result. The share price decline of 18% compound, over three years, is understandable given the company doesn't have profits to boast of, and revenue is moving in the wrong direction. Having said that, if growth is coming in the future, now may be the low ebb for the company. We don't generally like to own companies that lose money and can't grow revenues. But any company is worth looking at when it makes a maiden profit.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nZillow Group is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Zillow Group will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Zillow Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 5.6%, against a market gain of about 25%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

        "content": "Investors in Zillow Group, Inc. ZG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 16, 2024 $22.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Zillow Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Zillow Group is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Services industry that ranks in the Top 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 49 cents per share to 43 cents in that period.\r\n\r\nGiven the way analysts feel about Zillow Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "title": "The Best Place in Utah for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security",
        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the best place in Utah for a couple to live on only social security. If you wish to see our full list, please switch over to 15 Best Places in Utah for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nThe Senior Citizen\u2019s League recently announced its COLA estimates for 2025, and to the disappointment of retirees around the US, it is projected at just 2.66%, the lowest adjustment since 2020. This comes as a blow to all retirees, but especially to those already at risk of running out of retirement savings. According to MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), 91% of plan sponsors are concerned that future retirees will run out of money in retirement. Moreover, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) also reports that 71% of U.S. employees are concerned about outliving their retirement savings, up from 60% just two years ago. For those reliant on a mix of social security and savings, a lower COLA significantly compromises their ability to conserve savings whilst also maintaining their desired standard of living. To make matters worse, Social Security\u2019s Annual Trust Fund Report 2024 shows that trust fund balances are projected to deplete by 2033. Furthermore, although any cuts to retirement and disability benefits have been pushed back by one year, there is still a significant probability that come 2035, social security benefits will be slashed significantly.\n\nRetirement Annuities\n\nIn the face of such challenges, both retirees and pre-retirees might have to look elsewhere to ensure they do not run out of money in retirement. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) announced earlier this year that it will be offering a fixed immediate income annuity that would allow working individuals with different levels of savings to annuitize portions of their savings, thus ensuring a guaranteed stream of income during retirement. Similarly, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) has launched its LifePath Paycheck solution. This solution aims to offer guaranteed retirement income using an investment strategy that is tailored to a target retirement date.\n\n\u201cWe believe LifePath Paycheck will one day be the default retirement investment strategy, providing access to a predictable, paycheck-like income stream that can help improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in retirement.\u201d -Larry Fink, CEO & Chairman, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK)\n\nSuch solutions offered by MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) may be an effective method of ensuring you don\u2019t overspend your savings during the adolescence of your retirement. However, some research shows that a lack of financial literacy may be holding back retirees from maximizing their social security benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nLack of Social Security Literacy\n\nAccording to Forbes, 96 percent of Americans lose an average of $111,000 in their Social Security income due to errors made while filing for benefits. The reason people lose out on such a vast sum of money is that there is a lack of understanding regarding social security. According to a report by MassMutual, nearly 80% of people nearing retirement don't have a basic knowledge of Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nFurthermore, there have been studies by The American College of Financial Services that revealed that financial literacy can be linked to retirement wellness. Thus, familiarizing retirees and near-retirees regarding social security can significantly improve their ability to obtain a comfortable retirement. Consequently, AARP Utah recently began offering classes to clear up social security questions, in the hopes of assisting citizens in the Beehive State. While social security education is vital for retirees in all states, it is particularly important for retirees in states like Utah, due to its high cost of living & housing, as well as its unfriendly tax structure.\n\nRetirement in Utah\n\nAlthough Utah is home to some of the best places to retire in the American West in terms of natural beauty and adventure, it is far from being the most affordable state for retirees. The average home price in Utah is $522,884, per Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z). In contrast, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) reports that the average national home price in April was 358,734. Furthermore, the cost of living in Utah is 3.2% higher than the US average. Utah also lacks a retirement-friendly tax structure. It remains as one of the states that continue to tax social security as well as 401Ks, while other forms of pension incomes are subject to partial taxes.\n\nThere are also no tax exemptions for withdrawals from retirement accounts. In terms of property taxes, as of 2021, Utah had a property tax paid as a percentage of owner-occupied housing value of 0.57%. However, for those who don\u2019t claim the Social Security benefits credit, there is a retirement tax credit of $450 offered by the state. If you\u2019re wondering if Utah is affordable for retirees or where is the best place to retire in Utah on social security, join us as we look at the best places to live in Utah on social security. Alternatively, you may look at the best states to retire in 2024, including nearby states like Idaho, Nevada, or Wyoming. The Best Place in Utah for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of best places in Utah for a couple to live on only social security, we initially picked out the most recommended places in Utah for a couple to live on only social security on the internet. We used 10+ sources including our article on Best Places to Retire in Utah, NASDAQ, and Movoto to develop a shortlist. Further research was narrowed down to these places only. Among these best places in Utah for a couple to live on only social security, we developed a scorecard using metrics such as livability scores, cost of living, and average rent. Livability scores were sourced from Area Vibes while average rent was obtained from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z). By standardizing these metrics on a linear scale, each place was scored, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 15 places were chosen as the best places in Utah for a couple to live on only social security. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Richfield\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 11.85\n\nLivability Score: 71\n\nAverage Rent: $675\n\nIM Cost of Living: 89.0\n\nRichfield is located in Sevier County in South-central Utah. Although the area is generally known for its wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities, it also happens to be immensely affordable. Average rent in the city is the lowest of all the places on our list, while the cost of living is significantly lower than both the state and national averages. Thus, for those especially concerned about saving on housing costs, Richfield is the bestplace in Utah for a couple to live on only social security.\n\nIn terms of recreation, the Fishlake National Park lies just south of the city and features the largest freshwater mountain lake in Utah. In addition, there are plenty of canyons, mountains, and forestry in the area to explore. For wildlife enthusiasts, the woods surrounding Richfield are home to blue herons, moose, wild turkeys, and black bears. Richfield is also the site of Snow College, one of the most prestigious colleges in the state.\n\nAlthough Richfield is the bestplace in Utah for a couple to live on only social security in terms of rent, it isn\u2019t the most affordable option in terms of cost of living.\n\nTo find out which is, check out our full list of 15 Best Places in Utah for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best retirement destinations to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

It\u2019s true, unless Congress does something about it. The exhaustion of the program\u2019s funds means sharp cuts for an estimated 60 million beneficiaries and their family members. These benefits could be cut by as much as 21%, something that is going to set back the senior population, many of whom only have these funds to depend on.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t the Baby Boomer population save for retirement? They were the first ones with an access to a 401(k) retirement plan, which makes one wonder why they didn\u2019t use it to its full potential. According to a study, one of the biggest reasons late boomers weren\u2019t able to save much for retirement is the unemployment spike during the Great Recession. Obviously, the unemployed had little to contribute to retirement accounts, which meant smaller nest eggs at the time of retirement.\n\nHaving little to no retirement savings is a sad reality for many retirees today. A frequently asked question in these situations is, \"How can I live on just Social Security?\" While the answer isn\u2019t that simple, many retirees today are making it work. A common way they are managing living on small checks is by moving to some of the best states to retire on Social Security. Some of these states include Mississippi, Wyoming, and West Virginia; offering the best balance between cost of living and tax-friendliness. However, not everyone has the heart or funds to retire to some of the best places to live on Social Security.  Factors such as friends and family, sense of belonging, and other considerations may often keep one in states or cities where they\u2019ve always been.\n\nCase in Point: Oklahoma. Is Oklahoma a good place for seniors to live? Deemed one of the top tax-friendly states to retire to, Oklahoma offers an ideal balance between cost of living, scenic beauty, and welcoming atmosphere. This essentially makes it one of the best states to retire on just Social Security in the US. The cost of living in the state is an estimated 14% lower than the state average. The state doesn\u2019t tax Social Security benefits, and there are deductions available on other types of retirement income. So yes, Oklahoma is a retiree friendly state. Sales taxes may be high here, but retirement taxes, cost of living, and lower-than-average property taxes make it up for retirees.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding Your Nest Egg\n\nFor the retirees still on the path to saving up for retirement, exposure to stocks plays an important role in building up your nest egg. However, it also depends on what age you\u2019re at in your journey in retirement. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), investors may want to allocate more to stocks in the early years of retirement to guard against longevity risk, the risk of a retiree outliving their benefits.\n\n\u201cIt's all about striking the right balance between preservation and growth\". -Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)\n\nHowever, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) recommends considering a more moderate portfolio once individuals reach the age of 60. For those 80 and above, a conservative approach is the best for income generation as well as capital preservation.\n\nAs for those looking for some advice on retirement stocks, our article on the best retirement stocks according to the media reveal Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are the top two retirement stocks to buy.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) have been announcing annual dividend increases for the past 62 years without any breaks, crowning it as one of the safest dividend stocks in the market. Similar to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has also had its dividends increasing ever since 1963. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s updated database for Q1 2024, 80 hedge funds held stakes in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) as of the end of March of this year.\n\nThese two stocks hold potential for retirees who wish to build their retirement nest eggs, but our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The Best Place in Oklahoma for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places in Oklahoma for a couple to live on only Social Security, we consulted several sources including our lists on retiring to Oklahoma, as well as external sources such as Movoto, NewHomeSource, Niche, Unbiased, and WorldAtlas.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled, we ranked them on their median figure for a two-bedroom rental, their livability scores, and their cost of living. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places held a high quality of living, we removed cities with a livability score below 60. A unique Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each place based on these factors, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places in Oklahoma for a couple to live on only social security. For cities that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker.

        "title": "Why Is Zillow (ZG) Down 1.4% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Zillow Group (ZG). Shares have lost about 1.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Zillow due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nZillow Q1 Earnings Meet Estimates, Top Line Surges Y/Y\n\nZillow Group\u00a0 reported relatively healthy first-quarter 2024 results, with the top line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line matching the same. The company witnessed a revenue expansion year over year, backed by strong momentum in all verticals.\r\n\r\nIt has a solid brand position in the residential real estate industry. The company boasts more than 217 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites. Zillow\u2019s advanced technology, such as Real Time Touring, Listing Showcase, Follow Up Boss CRM and ShowingTime touring software, are gaining strong popularity among real estate agents. However, a challenging macroeconomic environment remains a headwind.\n\nNet Income\n\nGAAP net loss in the quarter was $23 million or a loss of 10 cents per share compared with a net loss of $22 million or a loss of 9 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The marginal increase in losses despite higher revenues was due to higher operating expenses.\r\n \r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s net income improved to $93 million or 36 cents per share from $87 million or 35 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nRevenues\n\nQuarterly revenues increased to $529 million from $469 million in the prior year quarter. Healthy growth in the residential and rental segment boosted the top line. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $509 million.\r\n\r\nResidential revenues witnessed a 9% increase from $361 million in the prior-year quarter to $393 million in first-quarter 2024, driven by healthy growth in Premier Agent Business. Growth in the New Construction business, expansion of Listing Showcase nationwide through ShowingTime+ and contributions from Follow Up Boss also supported net sales in this vertical.\r\n\r\nRevenues in the rental segment witnessed a 31% rise to $97 million from $74 million in the previous-year quarter. The expansion in rental revenues was driven by solid growth in multifamily listings.\r\n\r\nThe mortgages segment generated $31 million in revenues compared with $26 million in the year-earlier quarter, backed by solid growth in purchase loan origination.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nDuring the quarter, Zillow recorded a gross profit of $406 million compared with $377 million in the prior-year quarter, with respective margins of 77% and 80%. The operating expenses during the quarter were $451 million, up from $422 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $125 million compared with $104 million a year ago.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Zillow generated $80 million in cash from operating activities compared with $93 million a year ago. As of Mar 31, 2024, the company had $1.44 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $1 billion in convertible senior notes, net of current portion.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Zillow expects total revenues to be in the range of $525-$540 million. Residential revenues are expected in the band of $372-$382 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $100 million.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nAnalysts were quiet during the last two month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Zillow has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nZillow has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nZillow is part of the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Over the past month, Alphabet (GOOGL), a stock from the same industry, has gained 3.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2024 more than a month ago.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, indicating a change of +28.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of D.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Zillow analyzed rent affordability, job openings and the number of residents in their 20s to come up with this year's ranking of the best markets for new college grads\n\nPhoenix, Albuquerque, Colorado Springs, San Antonio and Portland, Oregon, are Zillow's best markets for new college graduates. Miami and the New York City metro area are at the bottom of Zillow's rankings, largely due to affordability challenges. Rent affordability is tight in much of the country, which may make renting an individual room a savvy option for grads striking out on their own.\n\nSEATTLE, May 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- College seniors who visited Phoenix for last month's NCAA basketball championship might consider staying and putting down roots. Phoenix is the best market for this year's college grads, boasting the best combination of rental affordability and concessions, job prospects and neighbors in their 20s for the class of 2024 to start life's next chapter on a high note. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nAlbuquerque, Colorado Springs, San Antonio and Portland, Oregon, round out Zillow's top five markets for new college grads.\n\n\"The first move after college is an exciting milestone. Zillow's best markets for new grads are great places to kickstart a career and take the first steps of adulthood,\" said Anushna Prakash, economic research data scientist at Zillow. \"Rents won't take up too much of a new grad's paycheck, leaving money to explore a new city or start saving up for a down payment. For renters who don't mind a housemate or two, renting a room can help save some extra cash and might even introduce lifelong friends.\"\n\nZillow's best markets for new college grads offer promising career opportunities as well as relatively affordable rentals. The analysis looks at rent affordability,1 the share of rental listings on Zillow\u00ae offering a concession, job growth2 and the share of the population ages 21\u201329.\n\nPhoenix rose to the top largely on the strength of its job market, which is the second-strongest among the markets Zillow analyzed. Phoenix also ranked within the top 10 for the share of rental listings on Zillow offering a concession, such as a free month of rent or free parking (50.5%), helping to overcome relatively expensive rents. A college grad making Phoenix's median entry-level income would spend 34.5% of that on the typical Phoenix rental.\n\nFor new grads who consider affordable rent their top priority, Des Moines, Iowa, is the place to be. Des Moines placed No. 11 overall in Zillow's ranking, and took the top spot for rent affordability. A typical college grad can expect to spend less than a quarter of their income on the typical rental there.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew grads looking to score a deal on a rental can focus their search on Charlotte, which comes in at No. 14 overall. Fifty-seven percent of Charlotte rental listings on Zillow are offering a concession, more than any other market Zillow analyzed.\n\nZillow Rentals provides new grads with a wide range of rental options to suit every lifestyle and budget, from apartment buildings with a doorman to single-family rentals with private backyards. Additionally, Zillow recently introduced the option to search for individual rooms for rent, perfect for those looking to split costs with roommates and ease the financial burden as they enter the rental market.\n\nZillow's Top 10 Markets for New College Grads Metro Area Overall Rank Rent Affordability* Rent Affordability Ranking Share of Pop.

        "title": "The Under-the-Radar All-Stars: 3 Stocks Quietly Crushing the Competition",
        "content": "There are some great companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. However, their success stories are widely known, meaning their stock prices likely have these stories placed in. Therefore, I decided to dig deep and look for three under-the-radar stocks. Moreover, I overlayed my search with best-in-class criteria to ensure each pick possesses sector-beating characteristics.\n\nMethodologically, my search focused on factors such as company fundamentals, valuation, and technical analysis. Additionally, I phased in qualitative variables like recent news and market sentiment to ensure alignment.\n\nInvesting in under-the-radar stocks might not be suitable for everyone. However, if you have the willingness to include some underappreciated stocks in your portfolio, then here are three names worth considering.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZillow (ZG) The zillow app on a screen\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those unaware, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) operates a digitalized real estate brokerage platform that allows a seamless buying experience. I\u2019ve personally used its platform and spotted numerous value-adds. For example, Zillow\u2019s interactive viewing and comprehensive property mapping substantially streamline the buying process.\n\nUnfortunately, resilient mortgage rates and topsy-turvey consumer sentiment have hindered the property market. Therefore, sector-based headwinds are en masse. However, Zillow\u2019s first-quarter results show that it is unabated by such headwinds. Zillow\u2019s first-quarter earnings impressed as the company posted a revenue beat of $21.25 million. Moreover, Zillow\u2019s first-quarter visits reached 2.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year.\n\nZillow\u2019s latest financial results show that its traffic remains robust. Additionally, Zillow\u2019s rising revenue conveys its ability to pass inflation to its end market. Although Zillow is unprofitable, its emphasis for now is blitzscaling. As such, I am confident that the firm will eventually deliver residual value to its shareholders.\n\nZG stock has slumped by approximately 30% year-to-date, dragging its relative strength index down to 35 and its price-to-sales ratio to 4.62x. I think these metrics communicate an excellent buying opportunity, especially as Zillow is outpacing its competitors.\n\nSibanye Stillwater (SBSW) A pile of platinum rocks.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSibanye-Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) is an overlooked tactical opportunity with peer-based advantages. The company primarily mines platinum group metals in South Africa and the United States. Moreover, Sibanye recently decided to enter the lithium mining industry via its Keliber project, which attaches a higher growth multiple to the company\u2019s commodity mix.\n\nStory continues\n\nA bird\u2019 s-eye view of Sibanye\u2019s latest operations casts doubt. For instance, it is unprofitable and busy with layoffs. However, a closer look shows that externalities led to such unfortunate events. For example, the company experienced mine floods in the U.S., sluggish platinum prices, and electricity problems in South Africa.\n\nAfter reading the above mentioned, you might question why I believe Sibanye will crush its competition. Well, the short answer is that I know the company and its optics when running at full flow. Fading externalities will likely see Sibanye return to its five-year average return on common equity of 24.4%, concurrently dragging its stock out of the abyss. Moreover, Sibanye\u2019s endeavors in lithium and copper acquisition talks signal an expansionary roadmap, which might add significant shareholder value.\n\nSBSW\u2019s price-to-book ratio of 1.4x is high for a mining company. Nevertheless, I think this is a buying opportunity as a recovery in platinum prices paired with less external pressure will likely see Sibanye outpace its competitors.\n\nMasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (MCFT) White Mastercraft (MCFT) boat on trailer at harbor\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Camerasandcoffee\n\nMasterCraft (NASDAQ:MCFT) is a U.S.-based recreational boat designer, manufacturer and retailer. I\u2019ve watched MCFT stock for a long time and engage with MasterCraft customers frequently, so I have a granular view of it.\n\nIn my view, MasterCraft\u2019s primary advantage derives from its loyal customer base. Although an anecdotal opinion, I have realized that MasterCraft\u2019s customers are passionate about the brand. In fact, my statements are backed up by MasterCraft\u2019s third-quarter results, wherein it beat its revenue estimate by $2.88 million and its earnings-per-share target by 25 cents, illustrating its competitive zeal.\n\nI admit that MasterCraft is a procyclical company. Its product line typifies durable goods. Nevertheless, I think MCFT stock is well-aligned to recover after its approximately 20% year-over-year slump dragged its price-to-sales ratio down to 0.78x.\n\nMasterCraft is a best-in-class industry pick with a well-aligned stock. As such, I\u2019m optimistic about its prospects!\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Housing Affordability Challenges Persist, Yet Buyer's Market Flourishes In Texas And Florida\n\nAmid rising mortgage rates and general unaffordability nationwide, cities in Florida and Texas are emerging as havens for homebuyers.\r\n\r\nWhile the broader U.S. housing market continues to favor sellers with high prices and tight inventory, specific metro areas in the South are bucking the trend, according to a Zillow market heat index.\r\n\r\nIn Florida, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami are classified as buyer's markets, indicating a shift toward conditions favoring buyers over sellers. Jacksonville and Tampa, with a market heat index of 44, and Miami, at 39, are seeing adjustments due to increased inventory levels and slower sales velocities.\n\nJacksonville and Tampa have benefited from construction efforts that have replenished housing stocks to levels closer to demand, Zillow noted, easing the pressure on buyers.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nNewly-launched high-yield fund backed by residential real estate has an expected 7-9% annual dividend. Here\u2019s how you can invest today. Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here\u2019s how to invest in the city\u2019s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.\n\nMiami, with the lowest index score among Zillow's highlighted cities, shows the most substantial buyer's market dynamics, characterized by higher inventory levels and a significant rate of price reductions. The shift has been particularly pronounced given Miami's high-value real estate market, where price adjustments can create substantial opportunities for buyers.\n\nTexas cities like Houston, Austin, and San Antonio each have a market heat index in the low 50s, classifying them as neutral markets.\n\nWith a market heat index of 55, Houston has a balanced dynamic where neither buyers nor sellers have an advantage. This is due to a consistent supply of new housing developments and a local economy that supports both sides of the market equation.\n\nAustin and San Antonio, both with an index of 52, have seen their inventory levels rise above pre-pandemic figures. The increase in housing supply has significantly shifted the markets to more neutral conditions, Zillow said, alleviating some of the competition among buyers seen in previous years.\r\n\r\nNational Context\n\nNationally, though, the housing market remains predominantly in the seller\u2019s territory. Ongoing challenges, including high mortgage rates and elevated home values, constrain buyer activity.\n\nTrending:\n\nPassive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHotter markets on the West Coast and the Northeast have index scores well into the strong seller\u2019s market territory.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco and San Jose, with market heat indexes of 111 and 112, respectively, are characterized by fierce buyer competition and rapid sales cycles, with homes often selling in less than three weeks.\n\nBuffalo, New York, touted by Zillow as the hottest market of 2024, boasts a market heat index of 118. Zillow said that inventory constraints and high demand continue to drive quick sales and fewer price cuts, contrary to the national trend toward cooling.\r\n\r\nIn places like Hartford, Providence, and other Northeastern cities, which also rank high on the seller's market index, the ongoing inventory shortages ensure sellers retain the upper hand.\r\n\r\nExperts suggest that the broader housing market may see a shift if mortgage rates stabilize or decline, potentially easing the current seller\u2019s advantage in hotter markets.\r\n\r\nHowever, macroeconomic factors, including Federal Reserve policies and broader inflation trends, are likely to drive those changes.\r\n\r\nRead Next:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

        "title": "Hedge Fund Caledonia Grapples With 26% Slide in Huge Zillow Bet",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- One of Australia\u2019s largest and most secretive hedge funds is sticking with its highly concentrated bet on Zillow Group Inc., predicting a sharp rally after the shares lost more than a quarter of their value this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Flight Routes Suffer the World\u2019s Worst Turbulence One Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence Citi Trader Got 711 Warning Messages Before Sparking Flash Crash \u2018It Felt Like We Had Crashed\u2019: Singapore Air Passenger Describes Turbulence Terror\n\nSydney-based Caledonia is the biggest shareholder in Zillow, the real estate firm that\u2019s slumped 26% this year and trades at about one fifth of its 2021 peak. That roughly $2.2 billion stake ranks among the world\u2019s most concentrated US equity positions held by a hedge fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe slide is testing the nerves of money managers at Caledonia, which first bought into the stock more than a decade ago. They say it\u2019ll triple by the end of next year, according to a March investor letter seen by Bloomberg. That\u2019s around three times higher than the average forecast of Wall Street analysts.\n\n\u201cWe have stuck with these positions and have not been bluffed out at the bottom, and we are going to strive mightily to not sell them too early,\u201d co-chief investment officers William Vicars and Michael Messara wrote in the letter. \u201cVolatility comes with the territory for us, and we are good with that.\u201d\n\nCaledonia didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Zillow declined to comment.\n\nHigh conviction, out-of-favor bets, like Zillow, are common place at Caledonia, which keeps a low public profile. The privately held fund manager launched in 1992 from the wealth of Australia\u2019s Darling family \u2014 a fortune built on grain and mining. In January, it managed about $11 billion and the fund has served Australia\u2019s business elite, including the Packer and Fairfax families, former giants of the media industry.\n\nWhile dealing with underperforming stock bets is part and parcel of life for hedge fund managers, the concentration of those wagers puts Caledonia in a relatively rare position.\n\nThe Zillow stake makes up around two-thirds of Caledonia\u2019s disclosed US equity investments, a level of concentration that ranks as the fifth-largest in a Bloomberg analysis of hedge fund positions worth at least $1 billion relative to a firm\u2019s US stock portfolio. For Caledonia, the holding also makes up about a fifth of the assets the firm reported in January.\n\nExecutive Meetings\n\nCaledonia investors will also get a chance to quiz Zillow senior executives themselves later this year. A client event will be hosted in December with Jeremy Hofmann, the real estate group\u2019s chief financial officer, and Brad Berning, head of investor relations, according to the investor letter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe origins of the Zillow position can be traced back in part to the firm\u2019s desire to own market leaders in real estate. Messara said in a 2014 interview with Bloomberg TV shortly after building its stake in the company that Zillow was set for substantial profit growth from increasing advertising generated revenue in the US, similar to Rightmove Plc in the UK and REA Group Ltd. in Australia.\n\nNow, Zillow says it\u2019s expecting stalling growth in the US housing market and projects lower sales in its core business. That disappointing outlook earlier this month helped drag on the shares, which now sit at about $41.80. That\u2019s about 79% below the 2021 peak when the company\u2019s market value touched $48 billion.\n\nCaledonia reportedly fell more than 50% in the year through June 2022, only to partly recover in the following 12 months, echoing Zillow\u2019s sharp decline and partial rebound. Exiting the stock would likely prove difficult, given prices can quickly move against large sellers.\n\n\u2018Extremely Well Positioned\u2019\n\nThe fund\u2019s sway over the stock may be under-appreciated given the hedge fund\u2019s clients invest separately alongside the fund. One, billionaire James Packer, purchased 9.4% of Zillow in 2013, only to retreat in the following years, while Vicars and Messara noted recent buying. \u201cWe have seen some existing clients add to Zillow over the past year, and we are thrilled by this uptake,\u201d the pair said in the March letter.\n\nThe hedge fund\u2019s recent letter signaled its commitment to the investment is intact. The US housing market is a \u201ccoiled spring\u201d that will eventually benefit Zillow as home transactions increased, Vicars and Messara wrote.\n\n\u201cZillow is extremely well positioned for the eventual rebound,\u201d they said. \u201cWe think Zillow can achieve very significant earnings growth and exceptional share price performance.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Rick Zhao and Patrick Clark.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019 Google\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Texas and Florida are now buyers\u2019 markets. Here\u2019s why it could be time to move to the South",
        "content": "The housing markets in Florida and Texas were particularly hot\u2014both figuratively and literally\u2014during the pandemic. Buyers flocked to these markets to get more bang for their buck, while also enjoying tax breaks and the sunny weather that comes with both locations. But this attention brought with it more competition, and buyers started to struggle with higher home prices and mortgage rates.\n\nBut now Texas and Florida are back at the top of the best housing markets for buyers, according to a Zillow report released Wednesday. These two states dominate the best places for buyers in Zillow\u2019s new market heat index, which takes into account the share of homes that have an accepted offer from a buyer within 21 days or fewer, the share of homes that have a price cut, and engagement with active listings on the website and app.\n\n\u201cWould-be buyers who witnessed intense competition in sunny Texas and Florida markets earlier on in the pandemic aren\u2019t seeing such a frenzy now,\u201d according to Zillow. Texas and Florida secured seven of the top 10 best buyers\u2019 markets in the U.S. while most of the country\u2019s 50 largest cities are still in favor of sellers, the Zillow report shows.\n\n\u201cAn influx of inventory is the main driver in a buyers\u2019 market. This increase in supply gives buyers options, and thus the power to negotiate and drive down prices,\u201d Erin Sykes, chief economist with Nest Seekers International, tells Fortune. In Florida and Texas in particular, there\u2019s been less competition and more supply driven by \u201cnew condo assessments that have priced out some owners, sustained high insurance prices, and the increased property tax basis created by higher-priced transactions,\u201d she says.\n\nSo for prospective homeowners who can afford to buy a home in today\u2019s market, the South may be the best place to move\u2014if you don\u2019t mind higher insurance prices and the heat. Here\u2019s why it could be time to become a permanent snow bird.\n\nYou can get a deal\n\nHigher inventory levels have been key to helping buyers find homes more easily in Florida and Texas, experts agree.\n\n\u201cMore inventory, less competition, and less urgency to borrow have their advantages, as there are far fewer bidders on properties,\u201d Greg Forest, a senior global real estate adviser at Sotheby's International Realty, tells Fortune. \u201cIt is clear that the right cities in Florida and Texas have become destinations for many people looking to move and travel south.\u201d\n\nHousing supply\u2014particularly on the west coast of Florida\u2014is surging, and sellers are cutting asking prices, according to a Redfin report released in late April.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cNow is the time to get a deal in the south,\u201d Sykes says. \u201cOur transaction volume has picked up, but most properties are going into contract 10% to 20% below asking price.\u201d\n\nPlus, the more time a home spends on the market, the more likely it is to experience a price cut.\n\n\u201cHomes in the less-populated areas between [Florida] metros are sitting on the market for weeks, leading sellers to lower prices,\u201d Sasha Dookhoo, a Florida homeowner who purchased her house in 2021 \u201cbefore the housing frenzy began,\u201d tells Fortune.\n\nTo be sure, there are still cities in both Texas and Florida where home prices are neutral or continue to rise\u2014and they\u2019re still higher than they were pre-pandemic.\n\n\u201cBoth Florida and Texas are attractive for buyers given the lower cost of living and favorable tax environments\u2014however, prices are still staggeringly high compared to a few years ago,\u201d Dookhoo says. \u201cThere are tradeoffs to moving to Florida because we need to prepare for hurricanes, and Texas, because of the intense heat waves.\u201d\n\nMore construction\n\nAnother reason Texas and Florida are currently considered buyers\u2019 markets is an increase in new construction. \u201cStrong construction in many of these markets has helped restore inventory levels,\u201d according to Zillow.\n\n\u201cIn Florida, I can\u2019t drive anywhere without seeing a new community popping up,\u201d says Dookhoo, who lives in Gainesville, which is about two hours north of Orlando. \u201cI travel to Orlando often and the number of homes popping up along the way in the most remote areas has been surprising to me.\u201d\n\nEspecially in Miami and West Palm Beach, the \u201cnumber of new construction condo units coming on the market\u2026 is staggering,\u201d Sykes says. However, many of these units are priced at more than $2 million, she says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we expect to find all these buyers,\u201d Sykes says. \u201cWe need to focus on building more work-force housing, not luxury.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Florida, Texas rank best for home buyers in new Zillow index",
        "content": "Inventory and new listings are rising nationwide, while price cuts hit a seasonal high point\n\nZillow's new market heat index shows seven of the top 10 markets for buyers are in Florida or Texas. Buffalo, the Bay Area and the Northeast rank among the best areas for sellers. High rates and more homes are easing competition, but sellers maintain a slight edge nationwide.\n\nSEATTLE, May 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Texas and Florida metros dominate the best places for buyers in Zillow's new market heat index, securing seven of the top 10 spots. But most of the country's 50 largest metros \u2014 and the U.S. at large \u2014 favor sellers, according to the latest market report1 from Zillow\u00ae. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"Prospective buyers in most markets today are feeling less intense competition than in recent spring shopping seasons. Pressure is easing up as mortgage rates raise costs and sellers return,\" said Skylar Olsen, Zillow chief economist. \"However, the pool of homes for sale remains remarkably low. This means the nation remains a seller's market despite high mortgage rates \u2014 homes are selling faster, with more buyer interest over any one listing, than pre-pandemic.\"\n\nStrong construction in Texas and Florida has helped restore inventory levels in those states, easing competition. Austin and San Antonio are two of just three markets with more inventory now than before the pandemic, while Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville have among the smallest deficits.\n\nThe top market for sellers is Buffalo, New York, forecast by Zillow in January as the hottest market of 2024. Among the top metros for sellers are more expensive (and inventory-constrained) coastal tech hubs, relatively affordable spillover markets in the Northeast \u2014 Hartford and Providence \u2014 and hot Upper Midwest metros Milwaukee and Minneapolis.\n\nZillow's new market heat index visually represents buyers' urgency or sellers' confidence in an area and shows how that's changed over time. It takes into account the share of homes that sell quickly, the share of homes with a price cut, and buyer engagement with active Zillow listings in a market.\n\nSpringtime competition coasts as costs and inventory rise\n\nBoth inventory and new listings posted solid gains monthly and compared to last year. Buyers had a lot more options to choose from, as inventory rose 6.4% from March to April and climbed 18% over last year, the second-largest annual increase since at least 2019. They also had more fresh options, with new listings up nearly 11% month over month and rising almost 16% year over year. Despite April's improvement, total inventory sits 36% below pre-pandemic norms.\n\nStory continues\n\nMortgage rates that spiked above 7% for the first time this year, along with these infusions of inventory, held competition steady at a time of year when it normally ramps up.\n\nU.S. home values grew 1.2% from March to April and are 4.4% higher than a year ago. That's a slight slowdown from 4.6% annual growth seen last month. The typical U.S. home is now worth $359,402.\n\nThe share of listings with a price cut reached 22.4% in April, the highest rate for April in the past six years and a significant step up from 17.2% last year. Price cuts can be a sign of weakening demand that foretells softer price growth ahead, or they can be a natural process of feeling the market out as sellers and their agents come up with their pricing strategy. The latter scenario becomes more likely in a rapidly changing market like we see today, with relatively few recent sales to look at as comps.\n\nHomes that sold in April sold in 13 days, which is fast by historical standards. However, that is three days slower than last April, the first time since June 2023 that the speed of sales fell behind the previous year's pace.\n\nSize rank Metropolitan Area April Zillow \r\nHome

        "title": "Rents Are Growing At Almost Double The Rate Of American Workers' Salaries",
        "content": "Rents Are Growing At Almost Double The Rate Of American Workers' Salaries\n\nDuring the 1970s, many of America's largest cities were also the scene of \"rent strikes.\" Their rallying cry was often, \"The rent is too high.\" It looks like the apocalyptic trend has returned in the 2020s. A Zillow study reveals that American rents are climbing at almost double the rate of American workers' salaries.\n\nThe study looked at rents from 2019 to 2023 and found that rents increased by nearly 30% during that period, while American worker salaries have only increased by 20%. That means rent went up 1.5x faster than American salaries in just four years. American workers, already being squeezed by inflationary pressures on consumer goods, are collectively crying uncle and demanding relief.\n\nZillow's findings will certainly qualify as unwelcome news if you're trying to rent an apartment in any of America's major metropolitan areas. Unfortunately, it will hardly come as a surprise. According to Zillow, rent costs are growing faster than worker wages in all but six of America's major metropolitan areas. The fact that home prices and interest rates are so high is only serving to keep many renters trapped in apartments they can hardly afford.\n\nIn years past, many American renters would rent apartments as steppingstones to homeownership. Today, an entire generation of Americans is coming to grips with the reality that today's rents make saving enough money to buy a house, or saving any money at all, like running on a treadmill to nowhere. Now, the high rents in cities like New York and San Francisco are spreading like wildfire.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nOnly 0.2% of single-family rentals make this platform's rigorous cut. You can co-invest in them with Jeff Bezos and other notable investors for only $100. Elon Musk, Ken Griffin and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nEven the Sunbelt and the Midwest are now experiencing the kind of dramatic spikes in rental prices that used to be commonplace only in major metropolitan areas on America's coasts. The study showed that Tampa, Florida, has seen rents grow by 50% since 2019, while worker salaries in the city have only grown by 15%. Up the coast, Jacksonville rents are up 35% while worker salaries have only increased by 12.2%\n\nThis dramatic spike in rents is not only keeping renters in their apartments for longer but also contributing to the homelessness crisis that has rocked many of America's major metropolitan areas. It is not at all uncommon now to see large homeless encampments or makeshift tent cities popping up in big cities all over the country. However, their presence in Southern and Midwestern metropolitan areas is a new and unwelcome surprise.\n\nStory continues\n\nIronically, San Francisco and San Jose have seen some of the smallest rent growth during the study, with gains of 3.4% and 6% compared to average wage growth of around 12%. Unfortunately for residents in both these cities, the average apartment rent per square foot shot into the stratosphere almost 15 years ago along with the median home price in those cities.\n\nMore troublingly, the pace of rent increases, home prices and interest rates is creating a housing crisis so acute that few of America's politicians or economic observers can offer anything more than vague statements of encouragement about the future. The recent comments by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are a perfect example of this attempt to provide limited hope for the future, while at the same time making no concrete commitments to solving the problem.\n\nIn speaking to Bloomberg News, Yellen said \"Housing is a real problem in the United States due to a huge shortage of affordable\" dwellings. That said, I strongly believe \u2014 I think it is highly likely \u2014 that shelter costs, which have been pushing up inflation, will come down.\" Those are encouraging words, but for most American renters, the relief she's predicting will likely arrive several days late and several dollars short.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.  This Bezos-backed startup selects America's prime single-family rentals and then lets you invest in them starting from $100.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Rents Are Growing At Almost Double The Rate Of American Workers' Salaries originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "New Zillow Home Loans tool addresses home buyers' biggest concern: affordability",
        "content": "BuyAbility, an innovative new tool from Zillow Home Loans, combines real-time mortgage rates with a buyer's credit score and income to determine a home price comfortably within budget\n\nSEATTLE, May 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Zillow Home Loans is introducing BuyAbility, a new tool that addresses one of the biggest considerations buyers face today: understanding what they can afford. Only offered on Zillow, BuyAbility gives buyers a personalized, real-time estimate of the home price and monthly payment that fits within their budget, and then gives insight into the likelihood of qualifying for a loan. BuyAbility is powered by real-time mortgage rates from Zillow Home Loans.\r\n\r\nBuyAbility is a new way for buyers to understand what they can afford, giving them the information they need to make educated decisions about where they call home. The interplay between mortgage rates and a buyer's credit score are important factors in determining affordability, but most calculators don't factor this in. Buyers just need to add a few simple inputs unique to their financial situation, such as income, credit score and the monthly amount they're comfortable spending, into BuyAbility. Within seconds, a personalized, real-time estimate of the home price and monthly payment that fits within their budget pops up, along with insight into their likelihood of getting approved for a mortgage at this price point.\r\n\r\nBuyers can get started on the Home Loans tab on Zillow's app1. A shopper's BuyAbility calculation will update regularly with changes to mortgage rates and their credit score. Simulated Images\n\n\"What many people don't realize is that your mortgage rate is highly dependent on your credit score,\" said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow Home Loans. \"The better your credit score, the lower the rate you'll qualify for, potentially saving you hundreds of dollars a month. BuyAbility is personalized to a buyer's credit score, income and down payment, and updated regularly to reflect current mortgage rates, giving home shoppers a true understanding of their buying power. BuyAbility is a great starting point for buyers who may be hesitant to look under the hood of their finances, or share personal details with a loan officer.\"\n\nIf mortgage rates change, it impacts the home price a buyer can afford and their likelihood of getting approved for a mortgage, and BuyAbility will adjust for this in real-time. For example, a median-income household would be able to afford a $380,000 home with rates at 7%; if rates went down to 6%, that same household could afford a $420,000 home2. Checking their BuyAbility regularly gives shoppers a clear and current understanding of their financial picture at any given moment.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuyAbility will change the way people shop for homes. Later this year, Zillow Home Loans will make it possible for buyers to shop for homes on Zillow using their BuyAbility \u2014 rather than a price range \u2014 allowing them to quickly identify homes that truly fit their budget. And since most people think about their finances in terms of monthly budgets, buyers will soon be able to see how much each home they look at on Zillow would cost them on a monthly basis, based on their BuyAbility.\n\nBuyAbility is an innovation only Zillow Home Loans could accomplish, personalizing Zillow's world-class shopping experience with a buyer's unique financial data and real-time mortgage rates from Zillow Home Loans.\n\nAbout Zillow Group: Zillow Group, Inc.

        "title": "15 Best Places in Maryland For A Couple To Live On Only Social Security",
        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places in Maryland for a couple to live on only Social Security. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the future of Social Security in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places in Maryland for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nThe Future of Social Security and the American Preparedness\n\nFirst introduced into binding by then-US President Theodore Roosevelt in 1935, a lot has changed since the dawn of the Social Security Act. In 1935, the University of California Berkeley put the average American life expectancy to be 59.9 and 63.9 for men and women, respectively. As for population statistics, the US was home to some 7.8 million individuals who were either 65 years old or above, as per the Social Security Administration.\n\nFast forward nearly 90 years, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the average American life expectancy has increased to 77.5 years. Similarly, the Pew Research Center indicates that the 65 and above population has swelled to 62 million. This time period also carries another marker - America\u2019s Social Security funds and Medicare Part A funds are on the precipice of depletion, and Americans are worried.\n\nAccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute\u2019s 2024 Retirement Confidence Survey, current retirees and workers alike are stressed over what the US government\u2019s changes to the retirement system could mean for their own Golden Years.\n\n\u201cIn fact, 79% of workers and 71% of retirees have this concern. Inflation\u2019s impact on their retirement also remains a concern among workers and retirees.\u201d -Lisa Greenwald, CEO, Greenwald Research\n\nKonish, a personal finance reporter at CNBC, says that at least 20% in benefit cuts would be unavoidable if the government does not take action. This depicts a worrying situation for the 88% of workers who plan to draw on Social Security payments during retirement.\n\nFurthermore, with the average monthly Social Security payment for 2024 already being well below the amount that BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) says is required by a household run by an individual 65 or above, the heightened disparity could prove treacherous. For reference, 2024\u2019s average Social Security check comes out to $1,907 a month, whereas BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) estimates a monthly budget of $4,345 - a difference of over $2,400.\n\nOne question that arises from the possible instability of Social Security is, \u2018Why are Americans not turning to alternative sources of retirement-time income?\u2019 A major reason is simply not knowing the options. While we may live in a time of information overload via social media, today\u2019s adults are subject to knowledge gaps when it comes to preparing for their retirement. For instance, the majority of Americans either turn to Social Security, employer plans, or personal savings when financially planning out their retirement. While important avenues, in doing so individuals miss out on a key retirement saving outlet - annuities.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, most Americans already have annuities in the form of Social Security benefits or employer pensions. However, commercial annuities are the area where Americans are lacking. According to research by Boston College, a mere 10% of Americans own commercial annuities. There are several reasons for this number being so low.\n\nOne is a lack of understanding of what annuities are and how they work. For instance, an American College of Financial Services study that tested older US residents on their annuity knowledge via a short quiz saw the average score come out to a low 12%. The highest possible score for this quiz was 100%, meaning that the average respondent was well below passing. Other reasons why more individuals aren\u2019t turning to annuities include their complex nature, their categorization as expensive, and the general mistrust that surrounds the topic.\n\nOf course, whether you decide to invest in annuities or not all comes down to personal preference, but for individuals that stick to spending retirement on a Social Security income, there are certain factors to be considered. The most important, perhaps, is the question of where to retire. With financial constraints on hand, retirees will need to find a retirement destination that is both affordable and offers a good quality of living.\n\nThe state of Maryland, with its abundant coastlines and baseball culture, can prove to be a good retirement pick. Financially, the state is favorable toward retired couples on a Social Security income as Maryland is among the states that won\u2019t tax Social Security income in 2024. However, Maryland is also an expensive state with a higher cost of living which means that some individuals may struggle, although this is at least partially offset by Maryland being among the states with the highest average Social Security payment.\n\nAs for rent, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) lists the median figure for a two-bedroom rental at $1,725 - 9% below the national median. Similarly, Maryland\u2019s average monthly grocery bill comes out to $343.67 as per Zippia. All in all, while on the expensive side, a Maryland retirement is achievable on a Social Security retirement, and Maryland is a good place for seniors to live.\n\nTo facilitate retired couples who are pondering the move to Maryland, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places in Maryland for a couple to live on only Social Security. 15 Best Places in Maryland For A Couple To Live On Only Social Security\n\ncolin-lloyd--uQK6Hrzu4k-unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places in Maryland for a couple to live on only social security, we consulted several sources including our lists on retiring to Maryland and Best Kept Secret Places to Retire in USA, as well as external sources such as WorldAtlas, home & texture, Niche, Movoto, and Acts Retirement-Life Communities. Once a list of places was compiled, we ranked them on their median figure for a two-bedroom rental, their livability scores, and their cost of living. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places held a high quality of living, we removed cities with a livability score below 60. A Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each place based on these factors, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places in Maryland for a couple to live on only social security. For cities that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places in Maryland for a couple to live on only Social Security:\n\n15. Greenbelt\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 60\n\nLivability Score: 76\n\nIM Cost of Living: 118.4\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $2,000\n\nStarting off our list of the best places in Maryland for a couple to live on only Social Security is the city of Greenbelt, set in Prince George\u2019s County. At first glance, Greenbelt might seem like a place that retirees living on Social Security would want to stay away from, given its high cost of living and rental figures. However, with a bit of searching, senior citizens can find affordable living in the city. Not only does Greenbelt home two-bedroom rentals around the $1,700 mark but many local programs help supplement seniors\u2019 cost of living - such as the Capital Area Community Food Bank\u2019s Brown Bag Program and the Prescription Discount Card.\n\n14. Hampstead\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 63\n\nLivability Score: 71\n\nIM Cost of Living: 109\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,750\n\nUp next is the Carroll County town of Hampstead. A small town with a population of less than 6,500 at the time of the last United States Census, Hampstead provides its citizens with a sparse suburban feel that is ideal for a slower retirement. Residents can visit the Greenmount Bowl Bowling Alley, Lions Club Park, and the Oakmont Green Golf Course.\n\n13. Mount Airy\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 68\n\nLivability Score: 71\n\nIM Cost of Living: 107\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,900\n\nA dual-county town, Mount Airy is our next pick. Located in the counties of Frederick and Carroll, Mount Airy was originally known for its Parr\u2019s Ridge train station located on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. With a warm, welcoming community, new residents of the town will fit right in, and there\u2019s lots that they can busy themselves with. Some of the town\u2019s best offerings include the Black Ankle Vineyards winery, the Mount Airy Museum, and Maggie\u2019s Restaurant which serves American and French cuisine.\n\n12. Elkton\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 73\n\nLivability Score: 65\n\nIM Cost of Living: 101.7\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,550\n\nElkton is one of thebest parts of Maryland to live in. Located in Cecil County, the town of Elkton holds a population of just under 16,000 - as per the last United States Census. The town was once named Head of Elk due to its positioning on the Elk River and was commonly known as the \u2018Gretna Green of the East\u2019 as it was a popular destination for eloping couples.\n\n11. Thurmont\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 76\n\nLivability Score: 77\n\nIM Cost of Living: 111.9\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,115\n\nAnother Frederick County pick, Thurmont is another small town on our list of the best places in Maryland for a couple to live on only Social Security. Although the town carries a higher cost of living at 11.9% above the national average, it is easily possible to make a good retirement on Social Security in the town. Not only are Thurmont\u2019s rental figures reasonable at around the $1,100 mark, but the local senior center also provides hot meals for a low price.\n\n10. Berlin\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 76\n\nLivability Score: 77\n\nIM Cost of Living: 102.2.\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,600\n\nA small town set in Worcester County, Berlin takes the tenth spot on our list. With a sparse suburban feel, the town is the perfect retirement escape for senior citizens who are looking to leave city life behind and enjoy a peaceful retirement. Residents can visit the Mermaid Museum, the Assateague State Park, and the Rum Pointe Seaside Golf Links golf course.\n\n9. Salisbury\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 76\n\nLivability Score: 60\n\nIM Cost of Living: 89.4\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,350\n\nLocated in Wicomico County, the city of Salisbury is one of the most affordable places to retire in Maryland. With a cost of living that is 10.6% lower than the national average, Salisbury is particularly accommodating towards retirees living on a Social Security income. Residents can visit the Salisbury Zoological Park, the Centre At Salisbury shopping mall, and the Burnish Beer Company microbrewery.\n\n8. Baltimore\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 80\n\nLivability Score: 77\n\nIM Cost of Living: 100.3\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,567\n\nOne of the best places to retire in Maryland - and the eighth pick on our list - is Maryland\u2019s most populous city. Located in a county of the same name, Baltimore boasts a population of almost 570,000 residents, making it the perfect retirement spot for senior citizens who are craving big-city living. Residents can visit the National Aquarium, the Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and The Walters Art Museum.\n\n7. Chestertown\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 81\n\nLivability Score: 65\n\nIM Cost of Living: 92.7\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,450\n\nWith one of the lowest median rental figures on our list, Chestertown is a great town for retired couples living on Social Security checks or an otherwise restricted budget. Located in Kent County, the town has a small population that numbers around the 5,500 mark as per the last United States Census. Residents can visit the Historical Society of Kent County Museum, Luisa's Cucina Italiana restaurant, and the Chestertown Farmers Market.\n\n6. Cambridge\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 81\n\nLivability Score: 66\n\nIM Cost of Living: 88.2\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,200\n\nLocated in Dorchester County, the city of Cambridge is one of the best affordable places to live in Maryland. Senior citizens can enjoy a relatively affordable cost of living along with a reasonable rental figure of around the $1,200 mark. Residents can visit the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center, the Long Wharf Park, and the Cambridge Premium Cinema.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Places in Maryland for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Best Places to Retire in South Carolina in 2024 15 Best Places in Missouri for a Couple To Live on Only Social Security 15 Tax-Friendly Countries To Consider for Your Retirement\n\nDisclosure: none. 15 Best Places in Maryland for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\r\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nThank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\r\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. \r\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. \r\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. \r\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nThank you, Mike. News Corp has again made substantial progress on our strategic imperative to transform the company and increase value for all shareholders. Our profitability rose slightly in the third quarter as compared to the prior year, continuing our growth this fiscal year and that increase follows the 3 most profitable years since the company was reincarnated in 2013. \r\nThat improvement, which gathered pace in April, came despite certain macroeconomic circumstances that were far from auspicious, whether a strong dollar that devalued our revenues outside the U.S., particularly in Australia, or the punitively high mortgage rates that obviously undermined activity in the U.S. housing market. \r\nThe U.S. housing market contrasts starkly with that of Australia, where strong performance underpinned robust revenue growth at Digital Real Estate Services. While at Dow Jones, the professional information business continued to prosper and the segment's profit margin expanded from 20.6% to 21.7%. \r\nWe remain well on track for the full year of strong results at News Corp. It is, by the way, worth highlighting that our free cash flow in the first 3 quarters was $491 million, a 53% increase on the $320 million for the same period last year. It is also worth noting that for more than a year, digital revenue has accounted for over half of our total revenues, and we believe that trend is destined to continue. \r\nWe are in the midst of an exponential digital revolution, and our own company has continued to change significantly and profitably. Importantly, we are working to promote our quality journalism in the age of generative AI and are gratified that the most enlightened leaders in the industry appreciate the commercial and social value of that content. \r\nSeparately to that end, we have this week extended our existing partnership with Google. As mentioned previously, we have been reviewing our company's structure and that work is intense and ongoing, and we have made underlying changes to provide maximum flexibility. \r\nThrough 3 quarters of fiscal '24, circulation and subscriptions accounted for 45% of revenues, with advertising at a modest 16%. 10 years ago, we were dependent on advertising for almost half our revenues. Most tellingly, advertising at News Media, then our largest source of revenue now accounts for only 8% of total revenue. I should repeat that number, 8%, and half of that figure is now digital advertising. So the character of the company has fundamentally changed. \r\nDow Jones continue to increase both revenue and profitability this quarter. The professional information business at Dow Jones is an increasingly powerful earnings engine with yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It remains on track to be the largest contributor to the segment's profitability by the end of this fiscal year, and we believe far into the future, given its high margins and 90-plus percent retention rate. \r\nDow Jones Energy, where revenues rose 15%, has just launched the APAC Carbon Market Report, which provides data and insights into emissions trading in Australia, China, New Zealand and South Korea. This important new offering complements OPIS's carbon price coverage for North America and other international markets. \r\nAt Risk & Compliance, where revenues also rose 15%, the team debuted its first Gen AI-powered product, Integrity Check, a fully automated research platform that rapidly produces due diligence reports on businesses and individuals from our unique database. Created in partnership with SAPIEN, Integrity Check will help companies ensure they are compliant in a fiendishly complicated and legally fraud regulatory environment. \r\nDigital subscriptions at Dow Jones increased 17% year-over-year and experienced the highest sequential quarterly net growth, with 322,000 added in the third quarter. Average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones brands, including The Wall Sheet Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Investor's Business Daily crossed 5 million for the first time during Q3. That total is approximately double the number 4 years ago. \r\nGiven the access to a bundle of premium products with The Wall Street Journal at the heart, the Dow Jones team is confident we should see a reduction in churn and an increase in circulation revenues in quarters to come. \r\nAs for advertising, the market for print remains somewhat soft, though digital advertising rose 4% compared to the prior year, and advertising trends overall improved on the preceding quarter. \r\nIn digital real estate, REA continued to show robust growth, with revenues surging 15% year-over-year, a 6% increase in listings across Australia helped spur that success. And I should note that listing growth has again improved in April compared to March, which we believe augurs well for the fourth quarter. REA also remains by far the #1 digital real estate platform in Australia, with 4.1x more monthly visits on average than its nearest competitor. \r\nThat strength and enhanced product mix for its customers enabled REA to introduce 10% average price increases. That new pricing schedule will apply from July, and we look forward to the benefits in the next fiscal year. \r\nMeanwhile, we are pleased with the continuing progress at REA India, with a 31% advance in revenues in the quarter. Outside, Housing.com is the leading digital real estate platform in the most populous country in the world. Given that country's economic growth, widely forecast to be around 7% this year and the prospect of ongoing political continuity, we are confident that we have a world-class asset with much potential for expansion. \r\nAt Move, we are obviously subject to abnormal aberrant conditions in a U.S. housing market, buffeted by high interest rates. However, revenue declines moderated this quarter and lead volume has turned positive for the first time in 2 years. The results this quarter are broadly consistent with our expectations, and we are improving the product and user experience to position ourselves to take advantage when the market trends change from headwind to tailwind. \r\nIn the wake of legal developments involving the National Association of Realtors, I would echo Move's CEO, Damian Eales' recent perspicacious comments about the importance of buy-side agents for those seeking professional guidance when purchasing a home, which is surely the most significant investment decision for many families. \r\nWe continue to closely monitor industry developments, but believe realtor.com is well positioned to capitalize on its relationship with homebuyers and with buyers and sell-side agents in this evolving landscape. We expect that interest rates will ultimately ease, and our experience in Australia suggests that the market will surge dramatically after an extended period of suppressed activity. \r\nIt is worth noting, our landmark rental agreement between realtor.com and Zillow. This deal upgrades the rental experience for consumers and allows landlords and property managers to benefit from the combined audience of both the realtor.com and Zillow platforms. There is also a clear financial benefit for realtor.com, which will allow us to focus on our core buy and sell-side offerings. \r\nFinally, I would point out that in March, according to Comscore, a verified third-party source, REALTOR's unique users grew 5% month-over-month, comparing very favorably to Homes.com, which experienced a decline in the same period. Moreover, realtor.com is 1.4x bigger in terms of monthly unique users and has approximately 3x the page views and minutes per visit. \r\nIndependent verification ensures statistical sumpsimus, not metrics mumpsimus. Our media platforms from The Wall Street Journal to the New York Post and MarketWatch and Bible Gateway give us a distinct advantage in expanding reach and building brands. \r\nSpeaking of Bible Gateway, at HarperCollins, while revenues for the quarter were slightly behind the record Q3 results in the prior year, segment EBITDA rose 2%. And for the year-to-date period, EBITDA was 40% higher. In April, we saw a stronger performance and hope that will continue for the fourth quarter. \r\nWe continue to believe the audio book market holds much promise, especially given our unique partnership with Spotify, which has already broadened the book audience. We hope to benefit from Spotify's recent expansion of its audio offerings to Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. And by the way, fueled by the growth of audio books, HarperCollins digital revenues hit 25% of total consumer revenues in Q3. We believe there is little doubt that the audio segment will continue its expeditious expansion. \r\nBestsellers in Q3 included Shelby Van Pelt's novel, Remarkably Bright Creatures. While Savannah Guthrie's Mostly What God Does continues to thrive, as does Peter Schweizer's Blood Money and Fangirl Down by Tessa Bailey. Pope Francis' memoir, Life: My Story through History, which we published in 8 languages, is selling well and will surely have an enduring [people] presence in libraries. \r\nWe anticipate a strong performance in Q4 with Lucy Foley's, The Midnight Feast; The War on Warriors by Pete Hegseth and Day Trading Attention by Gary Vaynerchuk.\r\nAt subscription video services, the Hubbl streaming aggregation product, launched in March, and we are working with our partners at Comcast to shepherd its adoption throughout Australia. The intent is to reduce churn by increasing engagement and improving the customer experience. Excluding ForEx fluctuations, adjusted segment EBITDA overall improved by 1% in the segment. \r\nKayo is benefiting from the impact of a fascinating season of both Aussie Rules Football and Rugby League, and had its highest sequential quarterly net additions since inception, powered by both new customer growth and reactivations. We anticipate that recent price increases at Kayo and expected strong subscriber growth will continue to benefit the bottom line as both leading sports codes are drawing record audiences. \r\nFoxtel continued to grow its streaming revenues in Q3, which now account for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues, up from 26% last year, which is helping to drive overall margins, which rose from 14.3% and to 14.5%. \r\nIn News Media, our brands continue to increase their digital penetration across the globe and we were vigilant on costs, which were 5% lower than a year earlier. We anticipate further significant savings as a result of our transition of TalkTV to focus on streaming and original video content for our established British brands. And we also expect tangible cost benefits following the regulatory approval for the joint printing agreement between News U.K. and the Daily Mail Group. \r\nThe Times of London will expand digitally and gradually into the U.S. during Q4, inspired by the success of the U.S. Sun in reaching new audiences and enhancing digital revenues. Much journalism is unfortunately [joined us], but our imperative is for reporters to have the objective of being objective and for our economists to have the objective of being subjective. \r\nAs of the end of March, The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers, including The Times literary supplement, were at 582,000, up 5% year-over-year. Meanwhile, digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of the end of March were over 1.1 million, up 7% compared to the prior year. \r\nIn the first 3 quarters of fiscal year 2024, News Corp delivered strong profit growth, and we fervently believe that the company is firmly on a pathway to continued success. Our trusted premium intellectual property resonates in an era of polarization and amidst a rising tide of AI field falsehoods and fuss. For us, AI stands for authentic and authenticated intelligence, not artificial intelligence or the artifice of intelligence. \r\nAs always, we remain sincerely grateful for the astute leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, and for the sage support of our Board, investors and customers and for the sterling efforts of all of our employees. \r\nOne final note. For more than a year, our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, has been falsely and cruelly imprisoned in Moscow. In public and not so public ways, we are actively seeking his release. We deeply appreciate those who have assisted the cause and we sincerely look forward to his emancipation. \r\nI now turn to Susan Panuccio for additional details of our performance in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nThank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, we remain focused on the execution of our strategy to transform News Corp with an increased mix of recurring and digital revenues as we continue to expand our information services businesses. This has been balanced with reinvestment in key growth initiatives and cost efficiencies as we navigate ongoing inflationary pressures in our markets.\r\nOur third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year, while adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year. \r\nTotal segment EBITDA was $322 million for the quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year on a reported and adjusted basis, and ranked as the second most profitable Q3 since the company's separation in 2013. \r\nFor the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05 compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.11 in the quarter compared to $0.09 in the prior year. \r\nMoving on to the results of the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $388 million, up 7% versus the prior year and up 9% on an adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $104 million, up 2% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by lower revenues and approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA grew 7%. \r\nREA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 15% year-on-year on a reported basis to $256 million and up 20% in constant currency. Growth was again driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. \r\nNew buyer listings rose approximately 6%, with Sydney up 20% and Melbourne up 18% despite an early Easter, which negatively impacted March volumes. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details. \r\nMove's revenues of $132 million were down 6% compared to the prior year, with declines continuing to moderate from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 5%, driven by lower referral and lead gen revenues, reflective of the broader industry trends and lower transaction volumes. \r\nWe saw an improvement in lead volumes for the first time in over 2 years, growing 4% year-over-year, benefiting from product enhancements and some stabilization in the housing market. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat versus the prior year at 72 million, but improving 9% from the second quarter. \r\nAs Robert mentioned, we announced a rentals partnership with Zillow to syndicate large multifamily rental listings, which went live May 1. The agreement, financially beneficial, allows us to materially expand and improve our rental content offerings and to reallocate investment to marketing and our core buy and sell-side offerings. \r\nAs we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning realtor.com for a housing recovery, and as a result, are increasing the rate of reinvestment in the second half of fiscal 2024. To reiterate, some of the key strategic focuses include modernizing the technology stack, ensuring we have the best content for our product offerings and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share. \r\nDamian has been very focal about the ongoing benefits of buyer agents. And while we will closely monitor the impact of the proposed NAR settlement, we continue to believe in the long-term opportunity for realtor.com and have not altered our strategic direction, which already includes diversifying revenues and expanding our seller offerings, which continue to scale. \r\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $455 million, down 5% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were down 1% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for over 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. \r\nTotal closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.5 million at quarter end, down 1% from the prior year, but up 5% versus the second quarter as Foxtel transitions into the winter sports season. \r\nTotal paid streaming subscribers were nearly 3.1 million, increasing 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from a strong start to the AFL and NRL seasons. \r\nKayo added 269,000 paying subscribers this quarter, the highest sequential quarterly net addition since its launch in fiscal 2019, which is consistent with recent trends of customers returning post summer. \r\nFoxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 13.3% versus 12.3% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to AUD 85 benefiting modestly from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March. \r\nSegment EBITDA in the quarter of $66 million was down only 3% versus the prior year despite the inclusion of $13 million of costs related to Hubbl, which launched in early March, and a 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 1%. \r\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Third quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $544 million, up 3% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 82% of total revenues, again, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. \r\nWe saw strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, including a 15% growth at Risk & Compliance to $76 million and 15% growth at DJ Energy to $63 million. Total PIB retention rates remained strong at over 90%. \r\nAcross the B2B portfolio this quarter, over 2/3 of the growth is coming from new customers, new products or upsells with the balance coming from annual price increases. At Dow Jones Energy, the mix between pricing and volume is more balanced this year due to the benefit of a pricing review, which led to above-average increases. \r\nWithin the Dow Jones Consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscription growth accelerating from the Q2 rate to 17% year-over-year and higher by 322,000 subscriptions sequentially, helped by increased penetration of the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement. \r\nBundling accounted for approximately 45% of the incremental digital only volume growth in Q3 and now represents about 14% of total subscriptions. We have taken price rises this quarter, increasing monthly rates by nearly 20% to a cohort of tenured print subscribers. \r\nAdvertising revenues declined 2% to $86 million, with year-over-year declines moderating slightly from the first half with digital improving, up 4%, driven by a rebound in technology spend. WSJ.com grew 12%, underscoring the strength of the platform and its valuable audience. Print advertising declined 11% due to weakness in the financial sector. Digital represented 63% of advertising revenues, up from 59% last year. \r\nDow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 8% to $118 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company. Margins improved year-over-year by 110 basis points to 21.7%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. \r\nCosts, as expected, rose modestly, partly due to the phasing of sales and marketing expenses as we mentioned last quarter. At Book Publishing, strong growth in our Christian business was not enough to offset some softness in our romance general books and children's divisions. Consumer softness and headwinds in the mass merchandiser accounts such as Costco and Walmart were greater than we expected in March. \r\nRevenues were $506 million, down 2%, but that compares with a record third quarter last year, while segment EBITDA improved 2% to $62 million compared to the prior year, largely due to the easing of supply chain pressures and the cost efficiencies driven by the HarperCollins team over the past 12 months. Margin improved slightly to over 12%. \r\nWe continue to see improvements in supply chain-related costs with freight distribution and manufacturing costs all down versus the prior year. Return rates again improved compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. The backlist contributed 63% of consumer revenues, up from 60% last year, while digital sales rose 5% this quarter, reaching 25% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio rose mid-teens helped by the recent Spotify partnership. \r\nTurning to News Media, performance continued to be challenged in the quarter with print advertising declines returning to more historic levels. Revenues were $530 million, down 6% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues also declined 6%. \r\nCirculation and subscription revenues were flat and down 1% in constant currency as cover price increases and digital subscriber growth were offset by lower print volumes. \r\nAdvertising remained challenging, down 13%, both on a reported basis and in local currency with print advertising trends notably weak across all markets. \r\nAs our News Media businesses face ongoing print challenges, they continue to work hard on their transition to digital and ongoing cost efficiencies. Segment EBITDA of $26 million declined $8 million, which was due to the lower revenue, partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 26%. \r\nAs for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short term, albeit economic indicators vary across markets. \r\nLooking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April grew 32% due to the timing of Easter as well as easier comparisons to the prior year. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. \r\nAt Move, we hope to see continued moderation in revenue declines. Like the third quarter, we expect continued reinvestment in marketing and product development, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere and the new rental agreement with Zillow. \r\nIn Subscription Video Services, consistent with our message last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year and some softness in streaming revenues due to the first half, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. \r\nAt Dow Jones, while we continue to expect strong revenue and profitability performance for the full year, underpinned by our B2B offerings, we expect modestly higher overall expenses for the fourth quarter and full year. \r\nAt Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends appear relatively stable, albeit third quarter was a bit softer than the first half for physical sales, but we are encouraged by the strength in downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year and expect strong performance in Q4, partly due to the prior year comparison. \r\nAt News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies in our digital product offerings. \r\nFor the other segment, we expect costs for the fourth quarter to be in line with the previous 3 quarters. We now expect CapEx to be relatively stable to last year, slightly lower than our initial expectations. \r\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners.\n\nEntcho Raykovski\n\nSo my question is around the Move investment, which you've made during the quarter and you flagged is ongoing. It sounds like it's both marketing and product development. Are you able to confirm that? And how much is going into marketing? How much is going to product development? \r\nAnd on the product development side, are you specifically targeting the sell-side agents with that spend given the NAR settlements? If you can provide some more detail around the sort of products you're investing in? And just more broadly, how do you think that settlement is going to impact the business model going forward?\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nEntcho, look, obviously, I don't intend to comment on specific legal cases. And the U.S. real estate industry is clearly in transition. But there's no doubt that realtors have a crucial role in the purchasing process, and we are proud to serve them.\r\nAs for realtor.com, our experience in Australia and our complementary media platforms and U.S. position us perfectly to take advantage of that tradition, where transition. We are very focused in the interim of on making sure that the back end is solid, that the user interface is great and that our customers get value for money. \r\nWe are very focused on buy-sell, hence our partnership deal with Zillow on rentals, which will be beneficial to both companies. And the imperative, really, is to focus on the world's largest property market, which is still relatively early in its digital evolution. And we have the media assets and now, from our global experience, to make the most of that moment.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nAnd Entcho, maybe just to add on that, too. I mean the spend itself is probably broadly focused roughly evenly across both categories. But I think the thing to remember is in relation to the back half of last year, we pulled back significantly on the marketing spend, particularly in Q3 and a little bit in Q4. So the prior year compares will look more challenging in relation to marketing spend. But to think about it more broadly, it's focused on both areas, product and marketing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.\n\nDavid Karnovsky\n\nMaybe on Book Publishing. I wanted to see if you could speak a little more broadly to what you're seeing in terms of demand trends right now. You mentioned some softness at big box retailers. \r\nAnd then with Spotify, what potential tailwind do you see for streaming and widening kind of the overall market for audio books? And can you say if you've seen any incremental interest from other DSPs to carry HarperCollins content?\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nWell, as for HarperCollins, we are all bookish to a certain degree and purchases ebb and flow like the pilot books on the bedside table. \r\nEarly last quarter, sales were strong, and then there was clearly a slight pause in purchasing. But what I can say is that we have seen a return to strong year-on-year performance in April and have a compelling roster of new releases. And even in Q3, we saw an improvement in margin from 11.8% last year to 12.3% this year. \r\nWe're certainly benefiting from the international expansion of audio books, as you mentioned, and the efforts of Spotify, who have transformed audio book streaming revenue, which rose 14% in the third quarter. So we're proud to partner with Daniel Ek and his talented team as they roll out streaming globally.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nAnd David, maybe just to complement that a little bit. It's not like a perfect comparison. The Book Scan data, when we have a look at it for Q3, showed consumption down 3%. So that gives you an indication that the market was a little bit softer for Q3. But going into Q4, we did have a particularly weak Q4 last year, so we would expect to see pretty strong compares as we finish out the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.\n\nAlan Steven Gould\n\nQuestion on the Google transaction. Can you flesh -- or this renewal, can you flesh this out a little bit? And remember, at one point last year, you talked about a 9-figure deal with the digital companies. I don't recall if that was just Google or others. And does this include generative AI in addition to using your journalism for other sources?\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nLook, I can't comment on the financial details of the deal other than to say that this is a renewal of the existing deal. It has nothing to do with a payment for AI, Gen AI use of our content, servicing of that content, training of that content or grounding of the content. So any negotiations for that particular use of our content will come later.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nAnd Alan, just from a financial perspective, well, we've never given a doubt specifically, you can assume that it's broadly consistent with the financials of the previous deal.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.\n\nCraig Anthony Huber\n\nYes, can you hear me okay?\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nYes, Craig.\n\nCraig Anthony Huber\n\nYes. Just -- I think everybody is really curious just about the progress that you're trying to make here to transform the company, to simplify the company and stuff. And obviously, we talked about this 3 months ago and 6 months when you talked about it privately -- I mean publicly, I should say. And obviously, you've done a lot of work on this before you made the announcement 6 months ago. \r\nI'm just kind of curious, can you give investors at all any sort of timeline when you guys might wrap this up and stuff? I mean, obviously, things are pretty quiet out there for most of the investment banks and the legal folks after that work on this sort of stuff. \r\nSo I know it's very complicated, what you guys are doing here, but what -- how much longer do you think we should have to wait with the next quarter or so? Or do you really have no idea?\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCraig, I'm sure that you and all on the call are sage enough to pass the phrases used in my earlier explanation and define the potential meaning. You can see that we're well advanced now, thinking and planning and that planning has involved necessary regulatory steps, and those were not simple steps, to ensure that we have maximum flexibility, genuine optionality. \r\nWe want to continue to generate momentum and create maximum value for our shareholders. And we're certainly not complacent. Even though the share price has risen as of yesterday, just over 46% in the past year, we do recognize that there is a significant sum of the parts discount, so stay tuned and not indefinitely.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.\n\nDarren Leung\n\nJust a quick one for me. Looking at the BINGE subscribers in Foxtel, they're down sequentially quarter-on-quarter. So the second time it has happened. But I'm just keen to understand a little bit about the drivers here and your response and thought process here, please?\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nDarren, I think when we think about it from the last quarter, I think we talked about this, there was the writer's strike towards the back end of last year, and that obviously had an impact on the content that was flowing through there. So that did have an impact on the subscribers, and we're seeing a carry forward of that. I mean, that's really what the impact is.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.\n\nLucy Huang\n\nMy question is in relation to cost out. I guess right now, the macro outlook still seems relatively uncertain, particularly for advertising and similar way with like the U.S. housing market. So just wondering if there's any script for some further cost reductions through the course of the next year if these conditions start to improve?\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nI think, Lucy, you might remember, we did -- we sort of announced, I think, probably a year ago, the 5% head count reduction. And I think we quoted a number of 160 million for the cost out. I mean it's great that we're actually -- we hit those numbers and exceeded those numbers actually. \r\nBut the really good thing is that the businesses are actually always focused on costs. So whilst that was a particular exercise that we did across the whole group, across all our businesses, there are different transformation initiatives that they continue to work on as they look for efficiencies. \r\nSo we feel pretty confident that we've got a good cadence in relation to that, that can help offset any shortfalls in revenue. And that's why you've seen such good margin expansion in the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\n\nBrian Han\n\nSusan, just on that cost out question. So it looks like some sort of cost reduction initiatives will be ongoing in the current fourth quarter. But how much of that do you think will be reinvested in realtor.com?\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nWe sort of -- we're trying to keep the balanced reinvestment within REALTOR itself. So I think I said in my prepared remarks, we've got some benefit from the upside in the new rental agreements that we've done with Zillow and we've got some other cost savings that we're doing with REALTOR. So whilst there is an increase in cost, we are trying to manage it there. \r\nI think when we sort of think more broadly about costs across the business, and sort of to the earlier point that we talked to with Lucy, we just constantly focus on looking for efficiency. So the U.K., we've announced a pivot in the TalkTV strategy to streaming, and that should unlock some savings, which we'll really see come through in fiscal 2025. The U.K. team have also announced a joint venture with the Daily Mail Group in relation to joint printing, that should unlock further savings. We know our Australian team are constantly iterating when it comes to savings. \r\nSo we sort of -- we try and have to think about it broadly across the whole company, but specifically in the divisions that we look for those cost savings.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jamie Laskovski from Goldman Sachs.\n\nJamie Laskovski\n\nI was just wondering if you could elaborate on the underlying company structure changes that have happened so far that were called out and what we should expect over the medium term?\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nJamie, they were regulatory changes related to the original composition of the company in Australia. And really, other than what I said earlier, I'm not at the liberty to say anything more at this moment.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we have no further questions. I'll now hand back to you for closing remarks.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nThank you, Leila. Thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we will talk to you soon. Take care.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Real Estate - Operations sector might want to consider either KE Holdings Inc. Sponsored ADR (BEKE) or Zillow (Z). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nKE Holdings Inc. Sponsored ADR has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Zillow has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that BEKE has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nBEKE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.79, while Z has a forward P/E of 25.55. We also note that BEKE has a PEG ratio of 0.33. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Z currently has a PEG ratio of 1.42.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for BEKE is its P/B ratio of 2.01. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, Z has a P/B of 2.08.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help BEKE earn a Value grade of B, while Z has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nBEKE sticks out from Z in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that BEKE is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This article looks at the 15 best places to retire in Delaware. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of healthcare expenses and the advantages of retiring in Delaware, please proceed directly to the 5 Best Places to Retire in Delaware.\n\nOn Retiring to Delaware\n\nThe economic hardships of retirement are one of the biggest challenges for Americans today. However, this concern isn\u2019t limited to individuals looking to retire in the next decade. According to Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE: LNC), having enough money in retirement is the second biggest concern for consumers of all generations. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) reports that 99% of Gen Z workers say they are facing obstacles to saving for their golden period. Simultaneously, the amount of money people feel they will require to retire comfortably has increased tremendously since the start of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to Northwestern Mutual, the average American now believes they need $1.46 million to retire comfortably in comparison to $951,000 in 2020. Understandably, Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE: CRBG) reports that only 27% of Americans are very confident or extremely confident that they won\u2019t outlive their retirement savings. Inflation and rising housing costs are two factors that have enabled Americans to come to terms with the reality of how expensive retirement will be. However, one factor that continues to be overlooked is medical care.\n\nMedical Expenses in Retirement\n\nAccording to Ben Storey, Director of Retirement Research at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), healthcare is the biggest retirement expense that people fail to account for. People tend to overlook the fact that Medicare fails to cover around one-third of all medical expenses, and these costs place a significant strain on retirement earnings.\n\n\u201c[People believe that] Medicare is going to pay for everything but, in reality, it only covers about two-thirds of your costs. Retirees counting on Social Security to supplement their retirement income are often surprised to learn that most of it may need to be used for healthcare.\u201d\n\n-Ben Storey, Director, Retirement Research & Insights, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC)\n\nAccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, couples enrolled in a Medigap plan with average premiums will need to have saved $234,000 to have a 50% chance of covering their medical expenditures in retirement and $351,000 to have a 90% chance. These figures may stretch even further as the average retirement period increases across the country. Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE: CRBG) reports that 54% of Americans aim to live to the age of 100, yet 40% of all Americans plan on retiring between the ages of 65-69. This adds up to nearly 3 decades of retirement, due to which 66% of Americans fear running out of money more than death, per Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE: CRBG).\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, many Americans are being forced to withdraw funds from their retirement nest eggs to manage immediate financial distress. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) revealed that the number of individuals who made a hardship withdrawal from their 401Ks between July and September 2023 was 27% higher than at the start of the year. As Americans struggle to cope with immediate financial costs, retirement savings continue to be neglected. One strategy to maximize retirement savings is to cut down on predictable expenditures such as housing and day-to-day expenses. Many Americans in the Northeast, referred to as the \u201cSnow Belt\u201d, are now relocating to Southern states. Our article on Best Places to Retire in the South shows that cost of living, affordability, and lower taxes are factors that attract retirees to these states. However, for those not keen on relocating too far South, the state of Delaware is one of the best places to retire.\n\nRetiring in Delaware: Pros\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to retire in Delaware, the foremost being affordability. The Diamond State has a median home price of $336,300, according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN). In comparison, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) reports that the US median home price is $420,321. Similarly, the median nationwide rent for Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) listings is $2,100. In comparison, rental listings in Delaware have a median rent of $1,995, per Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z).\n\nMoreover, Delaware also offers a very retirement-friendly tax structure. It is one of the states that have no taxes on social security benefits. There are partial taxes on other retirement benefits such as pensions and 401Ks. In addition, it has a State Sales Tax Rate of 0% and an Average Effective Property Tax Rate of just 0.55%, making Delaware a tax-friendly state for retirees. Although the cost of living in Delaware is 1.1% higher than the national average, it is considerably cheaper than both New Jersey and Maryland.\n\nWith these factors considered, if you are interested in finding out if retiring in Delaware is a good idea, join us as we look at where in Delaware is the best place to retire. Alternatively, you may look at our recommendations for the best places to retire elsewhere on the East Coast, including New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Maryland. 15 Best Places to Retire in Delaware\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in Delaware\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of best places to retire in Delaware, we initially picked out the most recommended best places to retire in Delaware on the internet. We used 10+ sources including Retireable, Movoto, and World Atlas to develop a shortlist. Further research was narrowed down to these places only.\u00a0 Among these best places to retire in Delaware, we developed a scorecard using metrics such as livability scores, air & water quality, cost of living, median rent, and median home prices. Livability scores were sourced from Area Vibes while median rent and median home prices were obtained from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) and Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) respectively. By standardizing these metrics on a linear scale, each place was scored, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 15 places were chosen as the best places to retire in Delaware.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "Bowling alley, anyone? Zillow survey finds 98% of adults still pine for at least one feature of their childhood dream home\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans born in the 1980s (62%) and more than half of those born in or after 1990 (55%) would buy their childhood home today if cost were not an issue. Only half of all Americans say they could afford to buy their childhood home at today's prices. About three-quarters of adults say that, as a child, their dream home included a pool (77%) and/or a home theater (73%). Similar shares of adults still consider these features part of their dream home today.\n\nSEATTLE, May 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0There's an old saying that you can never go home again, yet nearly half of all adults would do just that if they could. A new Zillow\u00ae survey finds that 44% of Americans would buy their childhood home if cost were not an issue, yet only half of all adults say they could afford it at today's prices. An even larger share of millennials and Gen Z adults would buy their childhood home today. It suggests that the nostalgia craze that has swept pop culture, social media, fashion and marketing has reached housing.\n\n\"It appears younger generations aren't just nostalgic for low-rise jeans and Barbie, but for a simpler time in their lives when home was a place of comfort and safety,\" said Manny Garcia, a senior population scientist at Zillow who conducted this research. \"They may associate positive memories with their childhood home, having lived there without the burdens of rent, mortgage payments, maintenance, insurance or other housing hurdles. Today, a comparable home can feel out of reach, especially for younger adults who aspire to buy, but face steep affordability challenges.\"\n\nChildren of the 1980s and 1990s are the most likely to say they would buy their childhood home today \u2014 62% and 55% respectively. Yet almost half of those born in the '80s (47%) and nearly two-thirds of those born in the '90s (62%) say they couldn't afford it at today's prices.\n\nThose would-be buyers now need to earn a six-figure income to afford the typical U.S. home. Younger generations may long for the housing market of their youth when prices were lower, but their parents likely faced similar, if not worse, affordability challenges in the early 1980s. In 1981, mortgage rates soared above 18%, taking the typical monthly mortgage payment amount up to 55% of a median income at the time. Today, a new mover's mortgage burden represents nearly 40% of a typical income \u2014 still well beyond the 30% threshold considered affordable.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuyers today have easier access to affordability resources. Home shoppers can see down payment assistance programs they may be eligible for on for-sale listings on Zillow. They can tap into online affordability tools to better understand how much they can comfortably spend on a home, and then shop for homes by monthly payment, instead of by purchase price.\n\nWhile many adults aspire to buy their childhood home today, they likely envisioned a very different dream home in childhood. The largest shares of adults say that, as a child, their dream home included a pool (77%) and/or a home theater (73%). Today, 72% of adults would still include a pool, and 76% would include a home theater in their current dream home, suggesting some dreams never die.\n\nWhen reality sets in, practical features prevail. A vast majority of adults now dream of a home with air conditioning (89%), a walk-in closet (89%) and a laundry room (85%). However, that inner child lives within a significant share of adults, who still want a bowling alley (43%), a frozen yogurt or soft serve machine (34%), and a soda vending machine (24%) in their present-day dream home.\n\nNot all generations grew up pining for the same dream home features. Elevators reveal the largest generational divide: 58% of those born in the '90s say their childhood selves dreamed of having a lift in their home versus only 21% of those born in the '50s and earlier. There is an almost equally large 35-point gap for Jacuzzis and hot tubs. Conversely, 38% of children of the '50s and earlier dreamed of a home with a white picket fence in their childhood, while only 21% of those born in the '90s say the same.\n\nAbout Zillow Group\n\nZillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 20 best places to retire in South Carolina in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating your retirement journey, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in South Carolina in 2024.\n\nOn Navigating Your Retirement Journey\n\nThe market for \u201cwould-be\u201d home-buyers remains quite \u201ctight\u201d, a recent Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) survey reveals. As of April 2024, the survey notes a revised down expectation on home sales considering mortgage rates remain elevated, limiting housing demand as well as sales volume. One real estate market that\u2019s making rounds on the internet for its continued rise in home prices is South Carolina. In its recent home prices forecast, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) notes that home prices in South Carolina have risen in 2024 and will continue to do so in the following year. As of 2024, home prices in the Palmetto State average at $293,893, up 4% year-over-year.\n\nDespite such inflation, rising home prices, and even fears of a recession, one demographic group has been on the move in search of the best states to retire. That's right, the US witnessed one of the biggest relocations in the year 2023, and that too by retirees. Reports from moving companies such as Hire a Helper and U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) have analyzed data and reported on these moves. According to Hire a Helper, South Carolina was the second destination witnessing the most retiree moves after the Sunshine State of Florida. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) shares some similar findings, reporting that the state is one of the fastest-growing in the nation, taking on the 4th spot. A poll conducted by ABC15 asking respondents why they moved to the Palmetto State revealed that 54% did for the weather, 14% for the taxes, and 21% for the cost of living. These findings shed light on the myriad pros of retiring to South Carolina, such as its inviting climate, tax advantages, and overall affordability. It also explains why the State is witnessing a rise in home values, even though it remains quite affordable as yet.\n\nMany retirees often wonder whether it's cheaper to retire in South Carolina than in states such as Florida. While the answer isn\u2019t that straightforward, it probably is. The cost of living in the Palmetto State is an estimated 5.4% cheaper than the US average. Moreover, while retirement income is partially taxed in the state, retirees can still avail up to $10,000 in deductions. Florida retirees claim to pay huge sums of money in insurance, and many have been going back to work simply because they can't afford the rising living costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nA T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW)'s recent Retirement Saving & Spending Study confirms this notion, stating how an estimated 20% of retirees are either working full-time or part-time, while 7% are also actively looking for employment. The T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) study reveals that many retirees consider part-time work as a good retirement strategy, and 57% of retirees want to continue working in one form or another.\n\n\"Many retirees either choose to work or need work to be included in their retirement lifestyle. The decision can have many powerful positive effects, not least of which is financial well-being\u201d.\n\n- Judith Ward, CFP\u00ae, a thought leadership director at T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW).\n\nExhausted by the rising costs of living, taxes, and similar financial pressures, retirees have been on the move searching for the most affordable places to retire in the US. Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), a diversified financial services company, notes how it\u2019s disappointing yet true that retirees today aren\u2019t able to get their well-deserved retirement. For this reason, they\u2019ve highlighted certain strategies that can help them retire even amidst a challenging retirement. One of the tactics that Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) stresses is reconsidering your time of retirement. Some retirees find themselves feeling secure if they continue working during periods of uncertainty.\n\nWhether you choose to work in retirement or manage expenses on your fixed income, choosing the best place to settle in your golden years is an important prerequisite.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 14 best housing stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip the detailed analysis of the housing market, go directly to the 5 Best Housing Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nFor the first time since July 2022, the median home prices in all the US states have either risen or stayed the same in the four weeks ending April 28, as reported by Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) on May 2. Home prices are rising despite mortgage rates going above 7% as people locked in at lower mortgage rates are reluctant to sell their homes, creating supply shortages. Moreover, on April 19, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) reported that luxury homes have reached record prices with a median price of $1.225 million. In Q1, luxury home sales increased by 2% despite the prices rising 9% and total supply increasing by 13% year-over-year. Compared to that, the prices of nonluxury homes increased by 4.6% year-over-year and its sales were down 4%.\n\nLuxury Home Builder Expanding Further\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is one of the largest builders of luxury homes in the United States. On April 25, the company announced its new project, Griffith Lakes \u2013 Waterstone Collection in Charlotte, North Carolina. The construction of the 52 new luxury homes is set to start in the spring of 2024 while sales will begin in the summer of this year. It reported its first-quarter earnings on February 20 and posted an EPS of $2.25, which outperformed the estimates by $0.47. The company\u2019s revenue grew nearly 10% year-over-year to $1.95 billion. In the second quarter, Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) expects deliveries of 2,400 to 2,500 units averaging at $1 million to $1.01 million per home. For the full year, the company expects to make 10,000 to 10,500 deliveries at $940,000 to $960,000 per home.\n\nInvestment management firm Baron Funds appreciated the performance of Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter. The firm said that it met with its CEO, Doug Yearley, the CEO of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Paul Romanowski, and Lennar Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:LEN) CEO Stuart Miller It believes that these companies are \u201cwell positioned to generate strong long-term shareholder returns.\u201d\n\nToll Brothers, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:TOL) CEO made the following comments at the company\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cAt first quarter end, we controlled approximately 70,400 lots, 49% of which were optioned. This land position allows us to be highly selective and disciplined as we assess new land opportunities. We believe we have a competitive advantage acquiring land at the corner of Main and Main, where very few of the big well-capitalized publics and privates play. Our main competition for this land tends to be the smaller local and regional builders who are not as well capitalized. Our balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity, low net debt and no significant near-term debt maturities. We also continue to expect strong cash flow generation from operations this year. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we received $181 million in cash from a land sale at the start of our second quarter.\n\nAs a result, we are increasing the amount we are budgeting for fiscal 2024 share repurchases from $400 million to $500 million. Longer term, we continue to expect buybacks and dividends to remain an important part of our capital allocation priorities. With that, I will turn it over to Marty.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nResilience Amid High Mortgage Rates\n\nD.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) are the second and third-largest construction companies in the world. Despite the challenges in the housing market, these companies have remained resilient and their managements are quite optimistic about their long-term goals. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) reported its second-quarter earnings on April 18, posting an EPS of $3.52, which exceeded expectations by $0.47. The company\u2019s revenue increased by 14.3% year-over-year to $9.11 billion. The company saw a 15% increase in homes closed and 14% in net sales orders. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) also updated its FY24 guidance, forecasting consolidated revenues of $36.7 billion to $37.7 billion. The market consensus is near the low point of its guidance at $36.75 billion. The company also plans to repurchase $1.6 billion of its outstanding shares. D.R. Horton, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:DHI) senior vice president (communications), Jessica Hansen made the following comments at its latest earnings call:\n\n\u201cFor the third quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 23,500 homes to 24,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 23% to 23.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 7%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 30% to 35% in the third quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 24%. Our full-year fiscal 2024 revenue, pricing, and margins will be affected by market conditions and changes in mortgage rates in addition to our efforts to meet demand by balancing sales pace and price to maximize returns.\u201d\n\nLennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) announced its Q1 2024 earnings on March 13 and posted an EPS of $2.57, outperforming the estimates by $0.37 and the company generated a revenue of $7.3, up 12.5% year-over-year. The company repurchased $506 million worth of shares in the quarter and increased its current stock repurchase program by $5 billion. CEO Stuart Miller made the following comments at the company\u2019s Q1 earnings call:\n\n\u201cWhile market conditions have remained challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market needs. We know that demand is strong and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across markets. With that said, as interest rates subside and normalize and if the Fed is going to begin to actually cut rates, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated, and we will be well positioned and well prepared.\n\nIf not, we will continue to produce volume and increase market share. To date, we have seen overall market conditions remain generally constructive for the industry. Even though higher interest rates have remained sticky, strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well-positioned for even greater successes as strong demand for affordable offering continues to seek short supply.\u201d\n\nWhile the high mortgage rates are a cause for concern for the housing industry, the supply shortage still makes a bullish case for it. Some of the best housing stocks include D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z). 14 Best Housing Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\n14 Best Housing Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Yahoo Finance stock screener to create a list of 21 home-building and other residential real estate companies. We narrowed down our list to 14 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Housing Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\n14. AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

(NYSE:AVB) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the third quarter, we maintained our exposure to apartment REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB). We believe public valuations remain discounted relative to the private market. Tenant demand remains healthy and rent growth has modestly improved since the first quarter of 2023. Rental apartments continue to benefit from the current homeownership affordability challenges. Multi-family REITs provide partial inflation protection to offset rising costs due to leases that can be reset at higher rents, in some cases, annually. We continue to closely monitor new supply deliveries and job losses in key geographic markets.\u201d\n\n13. Meritage Homes Corporation (NYSE:MTH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 29\n\nMeritage Homes Corporation (NYSE:MTH) is an Arizona-based company that designs and builds single-family attached and detached homes in the U.S. Meritage Homes Corporation (NYSE:MTH) was part of 29 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios in Q4 of 2023 with a total stake value of $600.944 million.

Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 30\n\nTaylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC) is engaged in designing, building, and selling single and multi-family detached and attached homes. The company is also involved in the development of lifestyle and master-planned communities. Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC) ranks 12th on our list of the best housing stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nOn May 1, RBC Capital analyst Mike Dahl raised the price target on Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC) to $63 from $61 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nAccording to our database, 30 hedge funds held stakes in Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC) in the fourth quarter of 2023, with positions worth $383.265 million.

First Eagle Investment Management has increased its stake in the company by 6% to 9.3 million shares worth $570.333 million and is the most prominent shareholder, as of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the most recent quarter, we re-acquired shares in Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR), the largest U.S. multi-family REIT. The company has assembled an excellent portfolio of Class A apartment buildings located in high barrier-to-entry coastal markets with favorable long-term demographic trends and muted overall supply growth. We believe the company is also well positioned to benefit from the affordability advantages of renting versus home ownership, annual leases that provide the potential for partial inflation protection, and its low levered balance sheet, which positions the company to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.\n\nIn our opinion, Equity Residential\u2019s shares are attractively valued relative to private market values and the company owns and operates excellent and relevant real estate that should perform well, long term.\u201d\n\n10.

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Waratah Capital Advisors is the biggest shareholder in the company and has a position worth over $122 million.\n\nThird Avenue Management stated the following regarding Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE:SUI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSun Communities, Inc.

American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\n\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH) is a real estate investment trust that owns, operates, and develops single-family rental homes.

As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the most significant shareholder in the company with a position worth $158.96 million.\n\nThe company is among the best housing stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Over the last five years, American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH) has gained 49.92%, and the company has recorded an EPS growth of 66.18% over the past five years, as of May 2.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFollowing strong second quarter results, we modestly increased our investments in single-family rental REITs American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH). Demand conditions for rental homes are attractive due to the sharp decline in home affordability; the propensity to rent in order to avoid mortgage down payments, avoid higher monthly mortgage costs, and maintain flexibility; and the stronger demand for home rentals in suburbs rather than apartment rentals in cities. Rising construction costs are limiting the supply of single-family rental homes in the U.S. housing market. This limited inventory combined with strong demand is leading to robust rent growth.\n\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent have an opportunity to partially offset the impact of inflation given that their in-place annual leases are significantly below market rents. Valuations are compelling at mid-5% capitalization rates, and we believe the shares are currently valued at a discount to our assessment of net asset value. We remain mindful that expense headwinds and slower top-line growth could weigh on growth later in 2023 and 2024. We will continue to closely monitor business developments and will adjust our exposures accordingly.\u201d\n\n7. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nPulteGroup, Inc.

PulteGroup, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:PHM) home sale revenues were up 10%, and net new orders increased 14% during the quarter.\n\nIn the quarter, 38 hedge funds held positions in PulteGroup, Inc.

The company operates the Beike platform, Lianjia store, Agent Cooperation Network, and Deyou brand.\n\nKE Holdings Inc.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places in Missouri for a couple to live on only Social Security. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted retirement in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places in Missouri for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nA Pandemic Retirement\n\nToday\u2019s senior citizens will be able to say something few others will - they lived through a full-blown pandemic mere years before they were set to retire - and it switched up their retirement plans. While now pretty much a thing of history books, the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most significant global events in modern times, and it has not settled without lasting impacts. One of these impacts was the mass layoffs that marred the pandemic years. Companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) were among the top companies, collectively laying off thousands of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPost-pandemic, this has led to an unexpected happening. While labor market participation rates for different age groups have reversed to settle at or exceed their pre-pandemic measures, the 55 and above age group is an exception to this happening. Although CNBC\u2019s All-America Workforce Survey reports that 57% of those who partook in pandemic-time retirement did so because they were laid off from their workplaces, the 55 and above population is now making a conscious choice to bid farewell to the workplace for good. So when the likes of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) laid off workers, they unknowingly pushed the older of those laid off into an unplanned retirement. Moreover, demographics show that within this age group, it is mostly white individuals without college degrees who are staying retired.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the decision of the 55 and above age group to partake in early retirement has left the US labor force with a deficit of 2 million workers. This shockingly large number consists of individuals who would otherwise still be employed had the pandemic not occurred. So, what exactly has led to this mass move for retirement, and how are those at the center of it faring? One reason for this unprecedented mass retirement is the wealth that the pandemic brought with it. For instance, the stock and housing market saw favorable growth in the 2019 to 2021 period. Since older individuals are likely to have greater investments - as they are saving for retirement - the age group underwent an accumulation of wealth that they were otherwise without, and that allowed them to consider a permanent early retirement.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis effect is particularly salient to older people \u2018on the margin,\u2019 who are about to exit the workforce altogether. Increases in wealth for this demographic tend to be reflected in large changes in the willingness to work. Since people close to retirement tend to own a lot of assets (as they are saving for retirement), and the values of many assets grew considerably during the pandemic period, this made them more likely to retire.\u201d\n\n-Miguel Faria e Castro, Economic Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nOther factors include an unwillingness to return to work - particularly to the office - a slower job market, and an ease in inflation. Many experts, such as Jesse Wheeler of Morning Consult, say re-entering the job market is difficult once a departure has been made, and that the older individuals who have permanently left the workforce have grown into retirement.\n\n\u201cThe longer you\u2019re in retirement, the harder it is to come back. Networks (that lead to job interviews) break down (and) skills atrophy.\u201d\n\n-Jesse Wheeler, Senior Economist, Morning Consult\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the fact that some individuals are simply enjoying retirement far too much to even consider returning to the workforce. With unplanned retirement on the horizon, the question of the non-financial aspect of retirement planning becomes even more pertinent. One of the main questions that arises is of the location of retirement as it is a common American trend to either find the best places to retire around the world or the best places to retire in the US.\n\nOne state that is worth considering is that of Missouri. It is important to remember that of those retiring early, not all will be wealthy or have large amounts in their retirement savings - and Missouri is accommodating to these individuals. For instance, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) states that Missouri\u2019s median rent is 38% lower than the national median. Similarly, Missouri holds one of the lowest average monthly grocery spends per person at just $312.63, notes Zippia. This puts it below popular retirement states such as Florida ($364.25) and Minnesota ($395.39). As for taxation policies, Missouri is among the states that won\u2019t tax Social Security income in 2024, helping retirees stretch their monthly budgets further. This makes Missouri one of the best states to retire in the US financially and one of the best states for low-income seniors.\n\nTo facilitate retired couples who are pondering the move to Missouri, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places in Missouri for a couple to live on only Social Security. 15 Best Places in Missouri for a Couple To Live on Only Social Security\n\nRuslan Guzov/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places in Missouri for a couple to live on only social security, we consulted several articles including our list of 22 US Cities to Retire on $3,000 a Month, 20 Best US Cities to Retire with $1 Million in Retirement Savings, Niche, Movoto, NewHomeSource, Unbiased, and Retirable, amongst others. Once a list of places was compiled, we ranked them on their average figure for a two-bedroom rental, their livability scores, and their cost of living. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) and Zumper, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places held a high quality of living, we removed cities with a livability score below 60. A unique Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each place based on these factors, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places in Missouri for a couple to live on only social security. For cities that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places in Missouri for a couple to live on only Social Security:\n\n15. Jennings\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 66\n\nLivability Score: 67\n\nIM Cost of Living: 88.6\n\nMedian Two-Bedroom Rental: $1,050\n\nStarting off our list of the best places in Missouri for a couple to live on only Social Security is the St. Louis County city of Jennings. With a cost of living that is 11.4% lower than the national average, our first pick starts out strong.

        "title": "New York City rents grew seven times faster than wages last year, tightening affordability crunch",
        "content": "Rents have outpaced wages in nearly 9 out of 10 major metros since 2019\n\nSince 2019, U.S. rents have grown 30.4%, while wages have grown 20.2%. Rents have outpaced wages in 44 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas. Wages caught up last year nationally and in about half of major metros. In New York City, rents grew more than seven times faster than wages last year \u2014 the largest gap in the country.\n\nSEATTLE, May 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Rent prices have surged in recent years, and wages have not kept pace. While last year was a bright spot \u2014 wages grew faster than rents nationally and in almost half of major U.S. metro areas \u2014 the opposite was true in New York City, where the nation's largest gap emerged. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nSince 2019, U.S. rents have grown 1.5 times faster than wages, according to a new analysis of rental data from Zillow\u00ae and StreetEasy\u00ae, along with wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.1 Demand for rentals from the large millennial generation \u2014 many of whose members have remained renters longer than previous cohorts \u2014 and Gen Z adults has run headlong into the country's housing shortage, causing rents to quickly rise.\n\nThat trend cooled last year, as national rent growth (3.4%) was outpaced by wage growth (4.3%). Strong multifamily construction has helped absorb demand for apartments, keeping rent growth in check in much of the country. But rents grew more than seven times faster than wages across New York City's five boroughs last year. That gap between rent growth (8.6%) and wage growth (1.2%) in New York City was larger than in any of the 50 biggest U.S. metro areas.\n\n\"It is encouraging to see much of the country making even modest progress in the rental affordability crisis. Unfortunately, New York City is heading in the opposite direction,\" said StreetEasy Senior Economist Kenny Lee. \"Despite a strong job market in the city, and in some ways because of it, the gap between what a typical renter can afford and the price of rentals on the market is growing. New multifamily buildings coming online has eased competitive pressure in many markets, but in New York City, construction just simply can't keep up with demand.\"\n\nModerating rent growth across the country has given wages a chance to catch up, providing a reprieve for renters in many markets. Rents dipped in three markets last year \u2014 Austin; Portland, Oregon; and San Francisco \u2014 while wages continued to grow. In 20 other metros, rents grew, but wages grew faster, giving renters some breathing room.\n\nFlorida markets occupy three of the five spots where rent growth has most dramatically outpaced wage growth over the past five years. Florida has been a migration hot spot since the pandemic, with new residents attracted by the possibility of year-round outdoor living and relatively affordable housing compared to many coastal markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis surge in demand has led to skyrocketing rents in the state, while wages have struggled to keep up. Even in Miami, where wage growth has been slightly above the national average, a nearly 53% increase in rents \u2014 the most dramatic jump of any U.S. market \u2014 has left a huge gap between the income residents are earning and the income they need to comfortably afford the area's typical rental.\n\nWages have consistently outpaced rents in recent years in only six major metros. The biggest gaps have been in San Francisco, San Jose and Houston.\n\nZillow and StreetEasy tools Zillow and StreetEasy have a number of tools that help renters with affordability and access.\n\nThe upfront costs of finding a place to rent can add up, with Zillow research showing those costs tend to be higher for renters of color. In New York City, upfront costs average almost $10,500, with broker fees often the largest expense. Lowering upfront rental costs will give all New Yorkers expanded choices in the rental market, which is one of the reasons Zillow and StreetEasy are advocating for broker fee reform.\n\nFor all apartment buildings, Zillow includes a \"costs & fees\" breakdown to help renters gauge the full affordability picture by highlighting certain onetime costs, such as application fees and security deposits, as well as recurring costs, such as parking. While the typical renter nationally pays $60 in application fees across all the rentals they applied for, Zillow offers a universal rental application that allows renters to apply to an unlimited number of participating rentals for 30 days for a flat fee of $35.\n\nZillow rental listings also include rooms for rent \u2014 individual rooms in units or homes \u2014 bringing more affordable rentals online. Renters using Zillow can include \"room\" listings in their searches alongside traditional \"entire place\" options.\n\n2019\u20132023 2023 Only Metro Area* Rent \r\nIncrease Wage \r\nIncrease Difference\r\n(Percentage Points) Rent \r\nIncrease Wage \r\nIncrease Difference \r\n(Percentage Points) United States 30.4\u00a0% 20.2\u00a0% 10.2 3.4\u00a0% 4.3\u00a0% -0.9 New York City** 27.5\u00a0% 11.2\u00a0% 16.3 8.6\u00a0% 1.2\u00a0% 7.4 Los Angeles, CA 22.2\u00a0% 17.2\u00a0% 5.0 2.0\u00a0% 2.7\u00a0% -0.7 Chicago, IL 22.3\u00a0% 8.5\u00a0% 13.8 5.4\u00a0% -0.1\u00a0% 5.5 Dallas, TX 29.0\u00a0% 19.5\u00a0% 9.5 1.1\u00a0% 2.0\u00a0% -0.9 Houston, TX 20.6\u00a0% 24.4\u00a0% -3.8 2.7\u00a0% 8.0\u00a0% -5.3 Washington, DC 18.0\u00a0% 12.8\u00a0% 5.2 4.6\u00a0% 3.5\u00a0% 1.1 Philadelphia, PA 24.2\u00a0% 14.8\u00a0% 9.4 4.0\u00a0% 2.0\u00a0% 2.0 Miami, FL 52.6\u00a0% 20.4\u00a0% 32.2 2.4\u00a0% 3.6\u00a0% -1.2 Atlanta, GA 35.6\u00a0% 12.2\u00a0% 23.4 0.3\u00a0% 0.2\u00a0% 0.1 Boston, MA 22.4\u00a0% 13.4\u00a0% 9.0 5.8\u00a0% -1.0\u00a0% 6.8 Phoenix, AZ 39.1\u00a0% 16.6\u00a0% 22.5 0.9\u00a0% 3.4\u00a0% -2.5 San Francisco, CA 3.4\u00a0% 12.0\u00a0% -8.6 -0.1\u00a0% 2.6\u00a0% -2.7 Riverside, CA 41.4\u00a0% 23.3\u00a0% 18.1 3.1\u00a0% 5.9\u00a0% -2.8 Detroit, MI 31.4\u00a0% 22.0\u00a0% 9.4 3.6\u00a0% 4.2\u00a0% -0.6 Seattle, WA 19.7\u00a0% 7.7\u00a0% 12.0 2.5\u00a0% 2.6\u00a0% -0.1 Minneapolis, MN 13.5\u00a0% 17.1\u00a0% -3.6 2.7\u00a0% 5.6\u00a0% -2.9 San Diego, CA 36.6\u00a0% 18.8\u00a0% 17.8 3.1\u00a0% 1.4\u00a0% 1.7 Tampa, FL 50.0\u00a0% 15.3\u00a0% 34.7 2.7\u00a0% 0.4\u00a0% 2.3 Denver, CO 23.1\u00a0% 20.3\u00a0% 2.8 3.0\u00a0% 5.1\u00a0% -2.1 Baltimore, MD 22.8\u00a0% 8.0\u00a0% 14.8 3.5\u00a0% 2.6\u00a0% 0.9 St. Louis, MO 31.2\u00a0% 22.6\u00a0% 8.6 5.4\u00a0% 5.6\u00a0% -0.2 Orlando, FL 36.3\u00a0% 17.4\u00a0% 18.9 1.0\u00a0% -0.3\u00a0% 1.3 Charlotte, NC 33.9\u00a0% 13.4\u00a0% 20.5 1.7\u00a0% 4.5\u00a0% -2.8 San Antonio, TX 22.3\u00a0% 15.2\u00a0% 7.1 0.3\u00a0% 3.6\u00a0% -3.3 Portland, OR 21.0\u00a0% 24.0\u00a0% -3.0 -0.2\u00a0% 2.9\u00a0% -3.1 Sacramento, CA 28.6\u00a0% 16.2\u00a0% 12.4 3.0\u00a0% 1.6\u00a0% 1.4 Pittsburgh, PA 22.7\u00a0% 12.5\u00a0% 10.2 4.7\u00a0% 3.0\u00a0% 1.7 Cincinnati, OH 36.5\u00a0% 15.2\u00a0% 21.3 7.3\u00a0% 0.9\u00a0% 6.4 Austin, TX 23.1\u00a0% 13.6\u00a0% 9.5 -2.3\u00a0% 2.4\u00a0% -4.7 Las Vegas, NV 34.3\u00a0% 14.4\u00a0% 19.9 2.2\u00a0% 0.2\u00a0% 2.0 Kansas City, MO 33.3\u00a0% 10.1\u00a0% 23.2 6.1\u00a0% 4.9\u00a0% 1.2 Columbus, OH 30.6\u00a0% 21.9\u00a0% 8.7 6.0\u00a0% 4.3\u00a0% 1.7 Indianapolis, IN 37.2\u00a0% 6.6\u00a0% 30.6 4.5\u00a0% 2.7\u00a0% 1.8 Cleveland, OH 32.1\u00a0% 16.4\u00a0% 15.7 5.1\u00a0% 0.8\u00a0% 4.3 San Jose, CA 6.0\u00a0% 12.5\u00a0% -6.5 0.8\u00a0% 6.6\u00a0% -5.8 Nashville, TN 29.1\u00a0% 17.7\u00a0% 11.4 0.6\u00a0% 2.6\u00a0% -2.0 Virginia Beach, VA 35.5\u00a0% 25.3\u00a0% 10.2 4.9\u00a0% 5.2\u00a0% -0.3 Providence, RI 44.2\u00a0% 22.4\u00a0% 21.8 7.3\u00a0% 3.4\u00a0% 3.9 Jacksonville, FL 36.7\u00a0% 9.7\u00a0% 27.0 0.1\u00a0% 0.0\u00a0% 0.1 Milwaukee, WI 25.8\u00a0% 26.3\u00a0% -0.5 5.9\u00a0% 5.5\u00a0% 0.4 Oklahoma City, OK 28.9\u00a0% 19.7\u00a0% 9.2 4.2\u00a0% 2.5\u00a0% 1.7 Raleigh, NC 30.7\u00a0% 15.2\u00a0% 15.5 1.1\u00a0% 4.9\u00a0% -3.8 Memphis, TN 36.0\u00a0% 13.1\u00a0% 22.9 1.4\u00a0% -1.1\u00a0% 2.5 Richmond, VA 33.3\u00a0% 32.1\u00a0% 1.2 3.1\u00a0% 5.7\u00a0% -2.6 Louisville, KY 31.7\u00a0% 23.0\u00a0% 8.7 6.1\u00a0% 4.4\u00a0% 1.7 New Orleans, LA 24.1\u00a0% 18.1\u00a0% 6.0 2.8\u00a0% 4.7\u00a0% -1.9 Salt Lake City, UT 33.4\u00a0% 28.6\u00a0% 4.8 0.8\u00a0% 5.5\u00a0% -4.7 Hartford, CT 35.5\u00a0% 7.6\u00a0% 27.9 7.1\u00a0% 3.9\u00a0% 3.2 Buffalo, NY 35.5\u00a0% 12.8\u00a0% 22.7 6.2\u00a0% 0.7\u00a0% 5.5\n\n*Table ordered by market size  **Includes only New York City's five boroughs\n\nAbout\u00a0Zillow Group Zillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the investment landscape surrounding US retirement, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Alabama.\n\nDecoding Retirement Investing\n\nTurns out college students aren\u2019t the only ones prone to leaving things to the last minute - several adults are pretty much on the same track when it comes to saving for their retirement. In the US, there is no legal requirement under which a company has to offer a 401(k) plan to its employees in most states- although companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) do offer 401(k) plans with partial matching. Without this requirement, many people miss out on saving for retirement altogether.\n\nIn fact, according to Ramsey Solutions, employer-sponsored retirement savings plans are withheld from about a third of US workers, whereas the latest Survey of Consumer Finances reports that a massive 46% of Americans are without a retirement account altogether. All this does not seem very promising, especially with a Northwestern Mutual study revealing that Americans themselves believe they require a whopping $1.46 million for a comfortable retirement.\n\nThe question of the hour, then, is how can this disparity between what Americans need in their retirement and what they currently have be solved? Founder and CEO of hedge fund management company Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, has a rather unique perspective. Ackman proposes that the US government give every newborn child in the country seven grand. Of course, Ackman doesn\u2019t propose simply handing the money away. Instead, he details putting $7,000 into an account when a child is born, barring it from withdrawals, exempting it from taxation, using it in index fund investment, and letting the amount compound.\n\n\u201cWe can't wait until people start creating an IRA or a 401(k) by the time they're, you know, 25 or 30 or 35 ... Just because of the laws of compounding. That extra 25 years is very, very material.\u201d\n\n-Bill Ackman, Founder and CEO, Pershing Square Capital Management\n\nAccording to numbers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 3.6 million children were born in the US in 2023. If Ackman\u2019s advice is implemented, the cost comes out to about $25 billion. While this number may seem shockingly high, it\u2019s a drop in the ocean compared to the US government\u2019s 2024 fiscal year spending which included a national defense budget of $433 billion.\n\nAs for more real avenues, there are other paths that individuals can explore for retirement savings in the case of their company not offering a 401(k) plan. Some options that Americans can look towards include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and health savings accounts. Each of these has its own benefit. For instance, traditional IRAs allow you to accumulate tax-advantaged retirement dollars, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals and growth during retirement as well as flexibility as there are no minimum distributions, and health savings accounts are also known for their tax-free growth. Of course, these are just some of the retirement savings options available to individuals, and the investment world is much more vast. So, even if you don\u2019t enroll in plans such as those offered by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees, all is not lost when it comes to saving and investing for your Golden Years. There\u2019s no age limit to it either - even if you\u2019ve reached your 50s, there are still steps that you can take to secure your retirement.

Consider Alabama, for instance - $2,500 a month would fare very differently than in states such as California or New Jersey. Starting off with one of the biggest monthly expenses, the state of Alabama is extremely accommodating when it comes to rent. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) lists the median price for a one-bedroom rental in Alabama to sit at $925 - a whole 42% lower than Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z)\u2019s reported national median of $1,600.\n\nThe state is also tax-friendly toward retirees. Not only is Alabama among the states that won\u2019t tax Social Security income in 2024, but private and public pensions are also exempt from taxation. On the non-financial side, there are other benefits to an Alabama retirement with climate being one of them. The state enjoys a temperate humid subtropical climate, ideal for retirees who want to avoid extreme weather conditions. All in all, retiring in Alabama is a good idea.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Alabama state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. 15 Best Places to Retire in Alabama\n\nA banker helping an elderly customer understand the finer details of a deposit product.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Alabama, we consulted several sources including our lists on retiring to Alabama, Cheap and Beautiful Places to Retire in the US,  Safest Places to Retire in the US, Best US Cities to Retire with $1 Million in Retirement Savings, as well as external sources such as Niche, NewHomeSource, Movoto, Unbiased, and Retirable.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled, we ranked them across multiple factors, namely, cost of living, livability scores, median house price, and environmental scores. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), and the cost of living index and environmental scores were our own. To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard, we removed places with a livability score below 60 and only included places that were above the US average environmental score of 56.5. A cumulative score was assigned - livability scores and environmental scores were given double weightage - with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. For places that gained an equal score, their livability scores were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "From skipping school and getting into fights to selling his company to Zillow: Here\u2019s how dotloop founder and Pacaso CEO Austin Allison made his first million",
        "content": "Dress for success, as the saying goes. No wonder Austin Allison, the real-estate entrepreneur worth over $10 million, wore a three-piece suit to college every day.\n\nAllison, 38, is the cofounder and CEO of Pacaso, a property brokerage firm that buys single-family homes in ideal destinations and sells them to a handful of different buyers who each own shares. The firm\u2019s vision is to give people at different income levels the opportunity to own a second home, an experience that its cofounder only had after a huge windfall.\n\nThe son of a carpenter, Allison has been working as long as he can remember, starting from his teenage years in rural Ohio. He quickly gravitated towards real estate, eventually launching dotloop, a tech start-up geared at automating the entire homebuying transaction process, including e-signatures. The product worked: He ended up selling his firm to the Zillow Group for $120 million, making Allison a millionaire in his own right.\n\nWith the financial cushioning, Allison and his wife bought a second home in Lake Tahoe, a formative experience that he realized people at all income levels would be grateful for. That led him and his coworker Spencer Rascoff to launch Pacaso, which aims to make second homes a possibility for more people at more income points. The project draws on each of Allison\u2019s values: Real estate investments are the best investments, location is key, and hard work should pay off.\n\nFortune spoke with Allison about his financial upbringing, his entrepreneurial pursuits, how he built Pacaso from the ground up, and where today's hottest second-home destinations are. The following conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s your background?\n\nI grew up in a small town north of Cincinnati, Ohio. My dad was a carpenter, so I grew up swinging a hammer starting at age three or four. And as the son of a carpenter, I lived paycheck to paycheck. We were fortunate enough to have a home and food on the table, but we didn't have discretionary income.\n\nMoney was always a point of stress and tension for my parents. But my father, being a carpenter, had to show up every day, and figure out how to survive and find his next job and put food on the table. Watching that growing up and experiencing that firsthand really inspired my aspiration to become an entrepreneur.\n\nI ended up getting into the real-estate business, and homeownership was always a dream for me, not a foregone conclusion. By the time I was 18 years old, I needed to find a way to pay for college, so I decided to start selling real estate.\n\nStory continues\n\nI sold real estate all through undergrad, and I ended up going on to law school after undergrad, which is where I started my first real estate tech company called dotloop. We built that company over a period of seven or eight years, and eventually we were fortunate enough to sell to Zillow Group, where I stayed on as an executive for about four years before leaving to start Pacaso.\n\nI grew up in a rural part of Ohio, where, as a teenager, it's easy to get into trouble. I found myself, like many teenagers, a bit lost and confused, hanging out with some of the wrong people, doing some of the wrong things.\n\nOne thing led to the next, and I got to a point where I wasn't a super productive contributor to society. I was not getting good grades in school. I was skipping class, getting in fights from time to time. I just wasn't someone that I\u2019d admire today. But fortunately, I was surrounded by a bunch of really great people at the time, starting with my family, who was always there for me and always loved me, and my girlfriend at the time, who's now my wife.\n\nWe've been together for over 20 years, and married for most of that time. We met when I was 16 years old, and I'm 38 now. She, along with my family, really believed in me, even when I was a troubled teenager. By the time I turned 18, I recognized that it was up to me to make the most out of my life. And it was up to me to make good choices, and to take responsibility for my actions. And that's what I did.\n\nAfter high school, I went to the University of Cincinnati. I studied architectural engineering and construction management. And then after undergrad I ended up going to law school, also at the University of Cincinnati. While most other students were out having fun and partying, I was working.\n\nI drove an hour each way to college for five years; I did a dual-degree program, so it was five years instead of four. I showed up at 7:00 or 7:30am, and I wore a three-piece suit to college every single day. I was selling real estate to survive, and ultimately, real estate became my channel to direct my energy and have a positive impact on the world. It ultimately created a career that would lead to other opportunities down the road.\n\nDid you have a first job before real estate?\n\nI\u2019ve been working since before I can remember. I was at the job site with my dad when I was three or four years old. I was working in construction and landscaping at 12 or 13 years old. By the time I was 16, landscaping was the primary job. I would drive trucks and lawnmowers, and that ultimately led to real estate, because I met some real estate people and I was intrigued by the industry. But I was also interested in this idea of helping people find their dream home, and it presented a lot of opportunities to grow as an entrepreneur.\n\nAs soon as I was old enough to get my real estate license\u2014which is 18\u2014that's what I did, and I transitioned from landscaping and construction to selling real estate.\n\nWhy did you go to law school when you were still doing real estate?\n\nI was inspired by a mentor of mine. I've always found that surrounding myself with great people leads to positive things. I was interning at Duke Realty, a commercial real estate firm in Cincinnati run by a gentleman named Dan. Dan was an attorney who never practiced law, and I remembered just admiring him, and the way that other people respected him, and the way that he approached various situations and conversations.\n\nWhen I learned that Dan was a lawyer, I tracked him down and asked why he decided not to practice. He said that law school, for him, was like an academic bootcamp. He said even if you don't have any intentions to practice law, if you're interested in further developing your skills as a student and as a business person, law school is a great place to go.\n\nI never actually planned to practice law, I only went for the academic bootcamp that Dan described. And it delivered on that promise\u2014and more. But law school is expensive. Fortunately, I was able to get some scholarship money to mitigate the cost.\n\nI ended up leaving law school in the third year, because my company at the time was consuming so much of my time that it wasn't possible for me to perform in both law school and in the company. When I raised capital for my first company, I was a first-year law student, and I remember talking to the investors, and one of the biggest objections that investors had was that I was a law student.\n\nAfter two years, our company was growing in such a way that made it impossible for me to both be the CEO and a law student. So I ended up taking a leave of absence, and I was hopeful that I would be able to go back to law school at some point in the next five years, but it just never happened. The company ended up lasting longer than that.\n\nWas the company your first venture outside of college, or did you have any other professional jobs before?\n\nI would say that dotloop was my first company, but it wasn't my first idea. I had lots of ideas that I had been thinking about and researching while I was in college. The first idea I had before dotloop was about digitizing the homebuilding process. I was working on that idea around 2008, and we all know what happened in 2008. The real estate market went through a big correction. Homebuilding came to a screeching halt. So I pivoted away from that idea and onto this other idea that I had also been thinking about, which is digitizing the real estate transaction.\n\nHow did dotloop come to be?\n\nI conceived the idea while I was selling real estate. I found myself chasing buyers and sellers around to get documents signed on the trunk of my car. That process was inconvenient for both me as the real estate agent, but also for the buyers and sellers. So I had this idea: What if real estate transactions could be fully digitized, so that buying a house could be as easy as buying a book on Amazon?\n\nThat was the original idea, but I didn't know anything about building a company or about technology. I only knew a little bit about real estate because I was selling real estate at the time. So I bought a book about how to write a business plan. I went through it, wrote a business plan, and started talking to other people I knew or had met throughout the course of my life, just to ask questions and learn about company building.\n\nOne of the people I connected with was my boss at the time, a gentleman named Jerry, who was vice president of sales at Duke Realty.\n\nJerry invited me to demo the product to him. He said, \u2018Austin, I really appreciate how loyal you are to me and Duke. But we'll always be here for you, you have to follow this dream. It may be a once in a lifetime opportunity. And by the way, I'd love to be your first investor.\u2019\n\nI didn't know anything about fundraising, and Jerry had never made an investment in a startup company. He just saw the passion in me and believed in me. He ended up writing a six-figure check to be my first angel investor. The next thing that came to mind after Jerry offered to be my investor, is that Jerry must have friends who would also like to invest.\n\nJerry ended up scheduling a meeting with me and a handful of his friends, to whom I pitched the idea. Three or four of them ended up investing, and that was the start of dotloop. We raised about half a million dollars from this group of angel investors. From that point forward, we were off to the races.\n\nHow long were you at dotloop before you sold it?\n\nWe started dotloop in 2009, and we sold in 2015. dotloop is now part of the Zillow Group, operating as one of the many services that Zillow provides to its real estate agent partners.\n\nHow did you make your first million dollars?\n\nI made my first million dollars by selling dotloop to Zillow Group for $120 million\u2014mostly in cash, and also some stock. As a founder-CEO, you don't earn a lot along the way. In fact, the first handful of years at dotloop, I didn't make a salary at all. And when we got to the point where I could take a salary, it was very modest, which is typical of early-stage founder CEOs. But once we became part of Zillow Group, all that changed. It was really a great opportunity. Austin Allison celebrates with his teammates after selling his company DotLoop to Zillow\n\nWas Zillow your first big paycheck?\n\nI would say that what felt like my first big paycheck was from my first real estate commission, which I think was $4,000 or $5,000. That was a ton of money for a kid from rural Ohio who's the son of a carpenter. The next big paycheck that I got was when I sold a home. I ended up buying my first home when I was 18, for $40,000.\n\nTo be clear, that wasn't the amount that I put down. That was the entire value of the home. And I ended up fixing that home up with my father and selling it a few years later for about $160,000. That was the first life-changing check that I got. Not my first million, but it was a life-changer for sure.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most expensive thing you've ever bought for yourself?\n\nReal estate is the most expensive thing I've ever bought for myself. Fortunately, real estate tends to be a good investment if you're buying in the right area. I just love real estate. After we sold to Zillow, one of my mentors advised me that I should not buy anything large or discretionary for one year after the sale.\n\nI basically didn't spend any money for one year after the Zillow sale, but once I got through that one-year period, the first big thing I purchased was a second home in Lake Tahoe. And that second home ended up being a big part of the inspiration for my current company, Pacaso, which is about making second homeownership accessible for more people.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for Pacaso?\n\nMy wife and I were very fortunate to become second-homeowners about 10 years ago. We were living in San Francisco at the time, and we\u2019d visited Lake Tahoe when we had a spare weekend. When we became second homeowners in Lake Tahoe, it changed our life in a really positive way. I learned that when you buy a second home, you're not just buying a piece of real estate, you're buying a second community, a second group of friends, a second life in many ways. And I wanted to find a way to make that dream possible for more people.\n\nFor the last 10 years, I've been thinking about how to make second homes possible for more people. One of the lightbulbs that went off for me along the way was the realization that most second homes are only utilized about 10% of the time. That means that we have a lot of empty homes sitting around the world. Pacaso is about connecting those two problems and opportunities.\n\nBasically, Pacaso is a co-ownership marketplace that empowers people to co-own luxury second homes together. The easiest way to get your mind around the ownership structure is: Imagine if you and three or four of your friends or family members wanted to buy a home together. Pacaso enables you to do that, except you don't have to know the other people, and we manage all of the details.\n\nWho is the targeted typical Pacaso homeowner?\n\nThe typical Pacaso homeowner is a family with children, most often. Usually they live within a couple hours\u2019 commute from their dream second home. Maybe it's a family in San Francisco that wants to own in Napa or Lake Tahoe. Or maybe it's a family in New York that wants to jump on a plane and be down in South Florida in a couple of hours. That's the typical use case.\n\nOne person can own up to four-eighths, or 50%, of the home, or as little as 1/8 or 12.5% of the home. Most people choose \u215b, primarily because most people are only using a second home four to five weeks a year, and 1/8 works out to about six weeks per year. But about 15% of our customer base owns multiple eighths. Some people will buy a quarter of one home, other people will spread their interest over multiple homes so that they can use different properties throughout the year.\n\nHow many times a year can an owner stay in the house?\n\nWe've created a proprietary scheduling tool called Smart Stay, which distributes the calendar fairly amongst the ownership group. So if you own 1/8 of a luxury Pacaso home, Smart Stay will ensure that you get 1/8 of the peak season, 1/8 of the non-peak season, and 1/8 of the holidays. Typically that works out to about five or six weeks, but you're not capped at that amount of usage, meaning if other owners in the home are not using their full allotment, then you would be able to use more than the one-eigth that you own. The Smart Stay tool is really designed to give owners optimal use of their property in a fair and equitable way.\n\nHow did you and your co-founder fundraise? Did you invest any of your own money into the company?\n\nI started Pacaso with a friend of mine, Spencer Rascoff, who I worked with at Zillow. Spencer was a co-founder of Zillow, and CEO of Zillow for about 13 years. We always dreamed about working on a company together, and he and I both left Zillow around the same time, in 2019. We immediately connected to start talking about business ideas.\n\nAfter Spencer and I connected on the idea for Pacaso, the first thing that we had to figure out was how we were going to raise money. Fortunately, both of us had a track record at the time\u2014in his case, Zillow, and Hotwire prior to that. When you have a track record, it's a lot easier to raise money than the first time around.\n\nWe basically just started making phone calls to investors we had relationships with. We had a lot of opportunities right out of the gate, which was very different from my first experience. We had several options to choose from, and that enabled us to pick a partner we thought would be right for us long-term.\n\nDid either of you invest any of your own money into Pacaso?\n\nYeah, we both invested some of our own money into Pacaso. Austin Allison stands in front of a Pacaso billboard in Times Square\n\nWere you working at Zillow after it acquired dotloop?\n\nAfter Zillow acquired dotloop, I stayed on as an exec for almost four years. Pacaso launched in late 2020, three-and-a-half years ago. In that time, we've sold about a billion dollars of Pacaso units, what we call revenue. We've expanded into pretty much every market around the U.S. and we also are in Paris, London, and Cabo.\n\nIn terms of how we grew so quickly, it was a combination of the right idea at the right time, and the right team. When compared to a typical startup or my first startup, I didn't have a team or a network of people to rely on. It was built through trial and error over an extended period of time. Whereas with Pacaso, we had the dream team right out of the gate.\n\nAnd it was a great time in 2021, which was basically the first year after launching. It was a really crazy time for the real estate market in a good way. Interest rates were low, home prices were appreciating quickly, people were experiencing more flexibility with respect to their working schedules, a lot of people were working remote, either part-time or full-time. And there was a lot of interest in second homes. We really benefited from that right out of the gate.\n\nHow many homes are currently in your portfolio?\n\nWe have about 1,500 owners now that are part of the Pacaso network.\n\nWhy did you expand to lower-priced homes?\n\nThe vision for Pacaso is about democratizing access to second homes. But we had to start somewhere. We chose to start at the very high-end: ultra-luxury homes in ultra-luxury markets. But the long-term vision is about serving more people, and the only way to do that is by having more homes across more markets at more price points. But even in markets where the price points are a bit lower, Pacaso is still a very luxury product. So our average home prices are well above the median in every market where we operate. But homes are a lot less expensive in rural Tennessee than they are in Malibu.\n\nDo you know the most expensive listing in terms of money?\n\nYeah, the most expensive listing that's ever sold on Pacaso was just under two-and-a-half million dollars for \u215b of the home. But most of our homes are offered at between $200,000 and $500,000 per \u215b share. But it does go up to about $2.5 million on the very high end again and Aspen.\n\nOn the opposite side of timeshares are Airbnbs. Why do you think Pacaso may be more appealing than Airbnb when choosing vacation spots?\n\nI think Airbnb is an amazing solution for someone who's only visiting a location once a year. But if you live in San Francisco, for example, and you're gonna go to Napa, or Lake Tahoe, multiple times throughout the year, Airbnb doesn't solve that problem really well.\n\nPacaso solves that problem really well, because you own the home, which means you get to leave your stuff in the home, you're guaranteed all the right times throughout the year in your home. You get to participate in the capital appreciation as that home goes up in value. So it really just comes down to usage. For very frequent usage, it's better to buy the whole home. But if you're using a place two to 10 times per year, that's where Pacaso is optimal.\n\nHow does leaving your stuff in Pacaso homes work when you're sharing it with other owners?\n\nWe outfit every Pacaso home with eight owners\u2019 closets where owners get to leave their stuff. When you show up at your Pacaso home, you pull your stuff out of the closet and just enjoy the home. You don't have to worry about any of the headaches or hassle that is customary of homeownership. And it feels like you own 100% of the home while you're there, but you're only paying for 1/8 of it.\n\nCan you give us your argument in favor of the co-ownership model? Why should people invest this way?\n\nThere are two main reasons why people choose co-ownership over the alternative of whole homeownership. The first is the cost savings. You're spending one-eighth of what you would spend to buy the whole home, which means you're either saving money or you're increasing your buying power to be able to afford more home than you would otherwise be able to afford on your own.\n\nThe second reason why people choose co-ownership is because it is the easy button for homeownership. Owning a home is hard. Owning a second home is really hard. All the little details around maintenance bill pay, things that break\u2014it's a lot of work. With Pacaso, we handle all those details for you, so you just get to show up at your home and enjoy it with none of the headaches that are customary of homeownership.\n\nWhy do you think millennials and Gen Z would benefit from co-ownership specifically?\n\nI think there are two relevant themes causing co-ownership to become increasingly popular with younger generations, not just for second homeownership, but also for primary homeownership. The first theme is around housing affordability. Homes are expensive, and it's becoming very difficult for people to afford a home on their own in many cities. The second theme is around the sharing economy and nomadic living.\n\nPeople, particularly in the younger generation, are becoming more and more nomadic, and more comfortable sharing things with other people. If you're nomadic and comfortable sharing, co-ownership is an absolute no-brainer, because it's less money for a better experience. And it gives you more flexibility in the way that you live and work. Austin Allison smiles for the camera\n\nWhat are your top three tips for homebuyers?\n\nMy top three tips for homebuyers would be to think long-term. Real estate is not a short-term investment, and I run into a lot of people who often think short-term about the purchase. It\u2019s very hard to find the perfect time to do anything, but one thing I can tell you about real estate in good markets is that it goes up over time.\n\nSo if you have a long-term time horizon on your real estate purchase, today is the best time to buy if you have a need. That\u2019s the first. The second is location. In the real estate world, we have this phrase: \u201cThere are only three things that matter in real estate: location, location, and location.\u201d Location really does matter a lot. You know if you're investing in a location that has a lot to like, where there's steady, growing demand, and a secular trend or macro trend that's causing more and more people to be interested in that market. That probably means it's going to be a good place to invest.\n\nThe third thing I would say is: Think outside of the box. In a market like this, where affordability is a challenge, solutions like co-ownership are the way to fulfill your vision. It\u2019s just becoming too hard for people to afford homes in many markets. I think now is the time to be creative and look at new and innovative models, such as co-ownership, to make your dreams a reality.\n\nHow many ownership shares do you have in Pacaso houses?\n\nI own three different Pacaso homes today. One is in Scottsdale, one is in Napa, and one is in Cabo.\n\nWhat are the hottest housing markets for Pacaso right now?\n\nI would say mountain towns probably are at the top of the list. Mountain towns are interesting because they have two very great and diverse seasons, winter and summer, which means that the season is longer. So if you have a four-month winter and a four-month summer, you're gonna get eight months of peak time throughout the year, which is awesome.\n\nBut they also attract two different types of people. There's some people who really love the winter, other people who really love the summer, and you get two for one.\n\nSome of the hottest cities or markets that people are focused on at Pacaso are definitely South Florida. Not just Miami, but there's lots of hot pockets in South Florida and the Carolinas that are super hot.\n\nIn terms of urban markets, we've seen a lot of demand for both Paris and London. Those would be the top ones that come to mind.\n\nDo you have any hot takes on the future of the housing market?\n\nThis is a really interesting housing market that's kind of tough to predict. But we know that supply is limited, and likely will continue to be limited. Anytime there's less supply than demand, it means that pricing should stay pretty firm, meaning I don't expect a huge correction in home prices. I think the more likely scenario is that home prices will continue to rise, especially in the markets with the most demand, but at a slower rate than what we've experienced over the last couple of years.\n\nIn terms of interest rates, which are a big needle-mover for the housing industry, the Fed is predicting a couple of rate cuts this year, which should translate into lower mortgage rates. And that would help the housing industry quite a bit. I think the biggest thing that we would see as a result of lower interest rates is an increase in transaction volume.\n\nTransaction volume was low in 2023, but we're already starting to see transaction volume climb in the first quarter of 2024. I think if rates come down, we can expect continued increases in the overall transaction volume. But again, I don't expect to see big decreases in price.\n\nWhat is one piece of advice that one of your mentors gave you in your young adult years that you carry with you today?\n\nOne piece of advice that my mentors gave me was to follow your passion and surround yourself with great people. And I've followed that advice in everything that I've pursued professionally and personally, and it's always served me very well.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article looks at the 15 best places to retire in West Virginia. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of Home Equity and Retirement in West Virginia, please proceed to 5 Best Places to Retire in West Virginia.\n\nCapitalizing on Home Equity\n\nAn important reason many Americans fail to accumulate any savings for their retirement is competing life priorities. Research from The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) has found that competing life priorities can reduce an average worker\u2019s retirement savings by up to 37%. These life priorities can emerge in the shape of a range of different expenses and ailments, such as inflationary pressures, a high mortgage, or unforeseen medical expenses. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) estimates that factors such as student loans can reduce retirement savings by 19%. As Americans struggle to divert any significant income towards their retirement nest eggs, their likelihood of securing a comfortable retirement becomes questionable.\n\nHowever, one crucial factor that many potential retirees fail to capitalize on is their home equity. Home equity is the difference between the value of an individual\u2019s home and their outstanding mortgage, which essentially represents what you own in a home. More importantly, however, home equity is recognized as an asset, against which homeowners can draw out loans to meet pressing financial needs.\n\nAccording to Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC), homeowner equity surged to 69.6% in 2023 which is the highest it has been since the 1980s (except for Q2-2022). In a research note published in August 2023, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) economists revealed that appreciation in home prices could help fuel the next leg of consumer spending.\n\n\"Strong home price appreciation in the years following the pandemic may be an underappreciated tailwind for the household sector. The total value of the U.S. single-family market breached $40 trillion last year, and the mix between debt and equity has shifted over time with the portion held by homeowners in the form of equity trending higher since about 2012.\"\n\n-Economists Tim Quinlan & Shannon Seery, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC)\n\nSimilarly, a 2023 survey by The Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) showed that 83% of respondents believed their home equity had increased within the prior year. Among those aware of their home equity, 57% estimated they have $100,000 or more in home equity, per The Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD). There are several advantages to borrowing against home equity, the most vital of which is that home equity loans tend to have lower interest rates in comparison to uncollateralized loans. Similarly, a Home Equity Line of Credit, or HELOC, can be used to obtain a revolving credit line at cheaper interest rates in comparison to personal loans and credit cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Finance of America Companies Inc. (NYSE: FOA) announced the expanded launch of its HomeSafe Second Loan initiative. Under this program, Finance of America Companies Inc. (NYSE: FOA) offers homeowners aged 55 years or older access to their home equity without adding new monthly payments or changing the existing rate on their primary mortgage.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s market conditions are uniquely challenging, and innovative financing is needed to fill gaps between consumers and traditional loan products\u2026.. We\u2019re proud to address that gap with HomeSafe Second and help retirees and pre-retirees access the wealth tied up in their equity without adding a new monthly mortgage payment to their cash obligations.\u201d\n\n-Kristen Sieffert, President, Finance of America Companies Inc. (NYSE: FOA)\n\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) reports that in its survey of homeowners who planned on renovating in the next two years, 38% planned on using either a HELOC or a Home Equity Loan to finance their renovation. Moreover, many of these homeowners are investing in these renovations with the intent of selling, optimistic that the renovations would help them appreciate their home values. This highlights that home equity isn\u2019t just a powerful tool to combat what The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) describes as a \u201cFinancial Vortex of Competing Life Priorities\u201d but can also be used to build up your retirement nest egg.\n\nThus, while retirement continues to be a concern for all generations, there are plenty of different strategies you can utilize to save for retirement. One common strategy for retirement is to relocate across state borders. The best states for retirement tend to be the ones that can provide you with the right combination of comfort and affordability. For those keen on a retirement in the South, there are plenty of cities in Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida that can be considered as the best places to retire in. In addition, the state of West Virginia features some of the best places to retire in the south as well.\n\nPros and Cons of Retiring in West Virginia\n\nThere are many reasons for retirees to consider spending their golden years in the Mountain State. With a cost of living 12.3% below the US average, West Virginia is one of the best states in the US to retire financially. According to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z), based on listings posted on their platform, West Virginia has an average home price of $161,063. This is significantly lower than the current national average which, according to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z), is $354,179. West Virginia is also considered to be quite tax-friendly. Property and sales tax burdens in the state are relatively low.\n\nOn the other hand, West Virginia is one of the states that still taxes social security. However, the state is in the process of phasing out its Social Security tax, having recently signed a bill that will exempt all retirees from Social Security taxes by tax year 2026. Currently, all single filers with income under $50,000 and couples earning under $100,000 are eligible for a Social Security tax exemption.\n\nWith these factors considered, if you are still contemplating whether West Virginia is a good retirement state, join us as we look at the best places to retire in West Virginia. 15 Best Places to Retire in West Virginia\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in West Virginia\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of best places to retire in West Virginia, we initially picked out the most recommended best places to retire in West Virginia on the internet.

        "title": "Renters care more about having a pet-friendly apartment than a washing machine, Zillow and Bark study shows",
        "content": "House hunting is challenging in today\u2019s market\u2014no matter whether you\u2019re buying or renting. Despite high rental prices, today\u2019s top concern for renters is finding a home where they can bring their furry friend.\n\nIndeed, twice as many renters filter for pet-friendly listings than for any other amenity in the 25 largest rental markets across the U.S., according to a study released Thursday by Bark and Zillow. That means renters are first filtering for \u201cpets allowed\u201d apartments ahead of what some people may see as necessities, such as a washer and dryer, parking, or a dishwasher. The only city in the U.S. that doesn\u2019t match this trend is New York City, where renters\u2019 most-used filter for apartment hunting is an in-unit washer and dryer.\n\nZillow and Bark\u2019s findings seem to indicate changing sentiments among those with pets. Nearly all U.S. pet owners say their pets are part of the family, according to a July 2023 Pew Research Center survey\u2014so it\u2019s not really all that surprising that people would consider their pet\u2019s needs when house hunting. Zillow data shows that 59% of renters have at least one pet, with 40% having a dog in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen people are on Zillow, and they\u2019re looking to buy or rent their next home, just as much as they\u2019re thinking about the school district, or the walkability score, or taxes, [they\u2019re also considering how] it will be for their dog,\u201d Dave Stangle, vice president of marketing for Bark, tells Fortune. \u201cWhat the most dog-friendly places are is top of mind.\u201d\n\nThe most dog-friendly cities in the U.S.\n\nFor their combined study, Zillow and Bark developed a weighted index using two key data points: Zillow data on pet-friendly rentals in the largest U.S. cities by population size and BarkBox and Super Chewer subscription data. Zillow also tracked the percentage of apartments that included a \u201cpets allowed\u201d filter. BarkBox looked at 13 years of information from its subscription data.\n\nTaking those factors into account, the top three pet-friendly cities all happened to be in the same state: Texas. In Dallas, 79% of rentals allow pets, while 77% of Austin listings do the same. San Antonio came in as the third-most-friendly dog city in the U.S., with 75% of rentals being pet-friendly. The remaining cities in the top 10 (which all exceeded the national average of 55%) include Charlotte, Indianapolis, Denver, New York City, Phoenix, Seattle, and Jacksonville.\n\nEmily McDonald, a communications manager with Zillow, tells Fortune that these findings weren\u2019t that surprising considering the high density of new construction rentals in these markets. As having a pet has grown in popularity\u2014particularly in the pandemic and post-pandemic era\u2014more renters are on the hunt for apartment buildings that not only are pet-friendly, but include pet amenities such as dog runs and grooming stations.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThese apartment buildings \u2026 want renters to fill these vacancies [and] need to make sure [they] allow pets,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cYes, you could find an apartment or a rental that allows pets, but knowing that you\u2019re going to be in a place [where] other people are pet parents and love their dogs\u2014and there\u2019s a community dog run and dogs for your dog to play with\u2014is a piece of this.\u201d\n\nThis also goes along with a trend that Bark is seeing in which pet parents are spending more on their pets for premium care\u2014not just utilitarian items such as food\u2014including pet-friendly hotels and other travel-related line items like flying with your dog.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing an increased spend a lot of times on more premium things,\u201d Stangle says. \u201cSo we follow a mix between consumer spending and also consumer behavior. Like in Bend, Oregon, the lifestyle of a half-wolf dog is going to be a lot different than a Frenchie named Bella in Brooklyn.\u201d Bella\u2014by far\u2014is actually the most popular dog name in the U.S., according to the Zillow and Bark study, with other top contenders being Bailey, Charlie, and Bear.\n\nWhat pet parents should consider when moving\n\nWhile many rentals are listed as being pet-friendly, some properties have breed and size restrictions for pets. Plus, some housing markets are simply more suitable for particular breeds. In other words, it\u2019s simpler and easier to have a smaller breed in a housing market like New York City where space is limited\u2014but in Western housing markets like Denver and Seattle, having a larger dog is more reasonable.\n\nIndeed, the most popular dog breed in New York City is a French bulldog, while Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers reign supreme in Dallas and Austin. Meanwhile, American pit bull terriers and Australian shepherds are particularly popular in Phoenix, Seattle, and Jacksonville.\n\nFor pet parents on the apartment hunt, McDonald suggests leaning on Zillow\u2019s filters to help ease the process.\n\nIt would be unfortunate \u201cgetting your hopes up or falling in love with an apartment to learn [you] can\u2019t bring your beloved pet,\u201d she says. \u201cSo definitely use the filters.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Montana. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the impact that climate change has on US retirement, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Montana.\n\nClimate Change and the Impact on American Retirement\n\n$16,972 - that\u2019s the average amount invested by The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) employees in fossil fuel bonds and stocks. Right behind them are Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) employees with an average investment of $13,085. These figures, attributed from the AtmoSphere tool, are investments made via employees\u2019 401(k) plans. At a time when the conversation surrounding climate change and its atrocious consequences is at an all-time high, future American retirees need to add another concern to their already overflowing plates - is their retirement planning destroying the planet?\n\nThe short answer is yes. According to Sphere founder and CEO Alex Wright-Gladstein, US retirement plans invest an estimated $1 trillion in fossil fuel companies. That\u2019s roughly 14% of the total amount that Americans have saved in 401(k) retirement plans. Considering that the road to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 calls for a yearly investment of $4 trillion according to the InternationalEnergyAgency, a redirection of 401(k) money could go a long way.\n\nSo, why is the average American worker investing so heavily in fossil fuels? And what is the outcome? For the former, it\u2019s mostly a lack of awareness, and then a lack of options. Many companies simply branch out and utilize companies such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Fidelity to set up their employee retirement plans. With companies such as BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) taking on the initiative, not only are employees separated from the factor of accountability, but they are also not given much information about the company stocks included in their 401(k) plans.\n\nWorse yet, many individuals face a lack of environmentally-friendly options when it comes to selecting their retirement plans. For instance, 14 Republican states have made it legally difficult for state pension funds, state agencies, and municipalities to conduct business with financial companies that account for climate change factors, reports GreenQueen. In fact, Plan Sponsor Council of America research indicates that less than 5% of 401(k)-type plans have climate change-cognizant funds available. So, it is very well likely that employees at the likes of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) either do not have access to climate-friendly retirement plans or are not aware of the harmful nature of their current plans.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen we look at the outcome of all this, the situation is dire. In 2023 alone, the US suffered over $93 billion worth of damage at the hands of climate change-related weather disasters, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. Senior citizens themselves are particularly susceptible to climate change, with their often compromised health being more exposed to its effects. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that senior citizens are at greater risk of heat illnesses and respiratory illnesses - among others - when climate change occurs.\n\nAdditionally, climate change also makes it more difficult for people to decide where they want to live in the long term, making retirement planning unpredictable. Is the place where they currently live safe enough from natural disasters? If not, then should they continue renting and hold off on purchasing a property that could potentially be their retirement home? Furthermore, many individuals are also facing problems obtaining renter\u2019s or homeowner\u2019s insurance, with premiums either being increased or insurance being denied altogether. All this makes the looming threat of climate change and its negative consequences even more severe for senior citizens.\n\nWhen deciding where to retire, individuals often consider different states, and it's important to think about how these states fare in the face of climate change. Take Montana, for instance. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency Montana is warming up. The state has witnessed a two-degree rise in temperature over the past century, with heat waves and droughts becoming more of a commonality. Despite this, Montana does comparatively well in regard to climate change when compared to other US states. The state takes the tenth spot on SafeHome\u2019s Climate Change Risk Index with a higher ranking indicating lesser danger.\n\nOf course, there are other matters to consider for a Montana retirement - particularly financial ones. The rental market is favorable to retirees with Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) stating the median rent for one-bedroom properties in Montana to sit at $1,250 - 22% lower than the national median. However, Montana is among the few states that tax Social Security in 2024. Single and joint filers have a respective income threshold of $25,000 and $41,000, above which benefits will be taxed at a rate of 5.9%. On the plus side, the state is one of the few without a general sales tax.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Montana state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Montana. 15 Best Places to Retire in Montana\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Montana, we consulted several sources including Unbiased, NewHomeSource, Niche, Empower, Movoto, WorldAtlas, Ramsey Solutions, and AZ Animals.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled, we ranked them across multiple factors, namely, cost of living, livability scores, and median house price. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) and Realtor, and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard and not overly expensive, we removed places with a livability score below 65 and a cost of living index higher than 120. A cumulative score was then assigned - livability scores were given a double weightage - with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Montana. For places that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "This article looks at the best places to retire in Kansas. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of changing retirement attitudes and retirement in Kansas, please proceed directly to 5 Best Places to Retire in Kansas.\n\nChanging Attitudes Towards Retirement\n\nRetirement in America isn\u2019t as straightforward and fated as it used to be. One simple reason for this is that retirement in the post-pandemic economic circumstances is vastly more expensive than before. According to Northwestern Mutual, the average American now believes they need $1.46 Million to retire comfortably in comparison to $951K in 2020.\n\nOne might infer that this may compel individuals to delay their retirement and continue to divert savings towards their nest eggs, however, not everyone shares this vision. In fact, attitudes towards retirement have become more diversified in the post-pandemic environment, with individuals considering many alternative paths to retirement.\n\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) reports that most Gen Z individuals plan on retiring by the age of 61. This observation is ratified by Edward Jones\u2019s study that most emerging adults (ages 18-34) wish to retire by the age of 61. If this sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. Edward Jones reports that emerging adults are less inclined to save than their predecessors.\n\n\u201cOur data found that financial advisors\u2019 GenNext clients [next generation of clients] want to retire at 61 \u2013 three years ahead of the generation before them but are less focused on saving for retirement than their parents or grandparents. Instead, they are prioritizing family planning (30%), everyday expenses (28%) and investing (23%).\u201d\n\n-Julia Bartak, Financial Advisor, Edward Jones\n\nAt the same time, many potential retirees are considering alternative paths to retirement. According to a survey by Fidelity Investments, 66% of adult financial decision-makers are planning for a gradual, phased-in retirement. Moreover, many individuals are looking to pursue their dreams and passions in their second act, with 60% of Gen Zs and 58% of Millennials hoping to abandon traditional retirement paths in favor of traveling, relocating, or even opening a new business.\n\nIn addition to phasing out of their careers, many seniors are putting off retirement by continuing to work full-time beyond the conventional retirement age of 62. According to F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. (NYSE: FG) 64% of pre-retirees are considering or have taken action to delay their retirement. In addition, F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. (NYSE: FG) reports that 44% of U.S. retirees or former retirees have returned or are considering returning to work.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis attitude towards delaying retirement is motivated by both personal and financial factors. According to F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. (NYSE: FG), among retirees considering coming out of retirement, 50% say it is because they enjoy the intellectual stimulation from working. In contrast, a survey of 401K participants by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) found that 62% of workers see inflation as an obstacle to saving for a comfortable retirement. 78% of respondents said these conditions are impacting their spending and saving habits, and 36% plan to delay retirement because of these conditions, per The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) survey.\n\nThus, while retirement continues to be a concern for all generations, there are plenty of different strategies you can utilize to save for retirement. One common strategy for retirement is to relocate across state borders. The best states for retirement tend to be the ones that can provide you with the right combination of comfort and affordability. For those living in the Midwest, there are plenty of cities in Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan that can be considered as the best places to retire in.\n\nRetirement in Kansas\n\nAnother state retirees can consider retiring to is Kansas. There are many advantages of retiring in Kansas. The Sunflower State has an average cost of living 12.9% lower than the national average. According to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN), the median home price in Kansas as of March 2024 was $262,100. This is significantly more affordable than the national median home price in March 2024, which Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) quotes as $420,321. Thus, for retirees interested in affordability, Kansas is one of the Best States for Retirement in the US in 2024.\n\nConversely, Kansas has moderately high taxes that can be unfavorable to retirees. Kansas remains one of the few states that continue to tax social security, albeit partially. Seniors with an adjusted gross income under $75,000 are exempt from social security taxes. However, other forms of retirement benefits such as private pensions and 401Ks remain fully taxed, as do withdrawals from retirement accounts.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is that Kansas lies in the Tornado Alley and witnessed 44 tornadoes in 2023 alone. That said, the state has moderately warm summers and mild winters, making it one of the few states that feature all 4 seasons impartially. With these factors considered, join us as we look at the best places to retire in Kansas. 15 Best Places to Retire in Kansas\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in Kansas\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of best places to retire in Kansas, we initially picked out the most recommended best places to retire in Kansas on the internet. We used 10+ sources including our list of 15 Best Cities to Retire in the Midwest, 51 Best Cities to Retire on $3,500 a Month, and 29 US Cities Where You Can Retire on $2000 a Month to develop a shortlist.

By standardizing these metrics on a linear scale, each place was scored, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 15 places were chosen as the best places to retire in Kansas.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "Why Zillow (ZG) Shares Are Falling Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of online real estate marketplace Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) fell 9.4% in the pre-market session after the company reported first quarter results. Its EPS missed, and the number of website/mobile app visits fell short of Wall Street's projections. Additionally, revenue guidance for next quarter was below expectations, which is further driving weakness in the stock. On the other hand, Zillow exceeded analysts' revenue and EBITDA expectations this quarter. Overall, the results could have been better.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Zillow? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nZillow's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nZillow is down 30.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $39.03 per share it is trading 33.3% below its 52-week high of $58.51 from December 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Zillow's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,216.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

The company witnessed a revenue expansion year over year, backed by strong momentum in all verticals.\n\nIt has a solid brand position in the residential real estate industry. The company boasts more than 217 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites. Zillow\u2019s advanced technology, such as Real Time Touring, Listing Showcase, Follow Up Boss CRM and ShowingTime touring software, are gaining strong popularity among real estate agents. However, a challenging macroeconomic environment remains a headwind.\n\nNet Income\n\nGAAP net loss in the quarter was $23 million or a loss of 10 cents per share compared with a net loss of $22 million or a loss of 9 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The marginal increase in losses despite higher revenues was due to higher operating expenses.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s net income improved to $93 million or 36 cents per share from $87 million or 35 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.

The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $509 million.\r\n\r\nResidential revenues witnessed a 9% increase from $361 million in the prior-year quarter to $393 million in first-quarter 2024, driven by healthy growth in Premier Agent Business. Growth in the New Construction business, expansion of Listing Showcase nationwide through ShowingTime+ and contributions from Follow Up Boss also supported net sales in this vertical.\r\n\r\nRevenues in the rental segment witnessed a 31% rise to $97 million from $74 million in the previous-year quarter. The expansion in rental revenues was driven by solid growth in multifamily listings.\r\n\r\nThe mortgages segment generated $31 million in revenues compared with $26 million in the year-earlier quarter, backed by solid growth in purchase loan origination.\n\nOther Details\n\nDuring the quarter, Zillow recorded a gross profit of $406 million compared with $377 million in the prior-year quarter, with respective margins of 77% and 80%. The operating expenses during the quarter were $451 million, up from $422 million in the prior-year quarter.

My name is Elliot, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Zillow Group First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Berning, Vice President, Strategic Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBradley Allen Berning\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Zillow Group's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Zillow Group's Co-Founder and CEO, Rich Barton; COO, Jeremy Wacksman; and CFO, Jeremy Hofmann.\r\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future performance and operating plans based on current expectations and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to consider the risk factors described in our SEC filings for additional information. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law.\r\nThis call is being broadcast on the Internet and is accessible on our Investor Relations website. A recording of the call will be available later today. During the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, which we will refer to as EBITDA. We encourage you to read our shareholder letter and earnings release, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, as they contain important information about our GAAP and non-GAAP results, including reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures.\r\nWe will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\n\nRichard N. Barton\n\nThanks, Brad. Good afternoon and good evening for those on the East Coast. Thanks for dialing in to hear our first quarter 2024 results. We saw strong revenue numbers that flowed through to the bottom line, helping us outperform our outlook on revenue and EBITDA as we successfully execute on our growth strategy.\r\nWe continue to upgrade and scale our housing super app, and we've seen further proof points in our Enhanced Markets that support a continued push on both breadth of market coverage and depth of penetration within those markets for our integrated digital moving solutions for consumers, their agents and their loan officers.\r\nToday, I'll remind us about what makes Zillow different, and what makes me so confident in our growth plan. Jeremy Wacksman will then give a progress report on our growth pillars with a deep dive into our burgeoning Rentals business. Next, Jeremy Hofmann will discuss the numbers in more detail, and then we'll open things up for Q&A.\r\nBeginning with our quarterly results, we reported better-than-expected revenue growth across the business. Q1 revenue of $529 million grew 13% year-over-year. Total revenue growth once again outperformed the residential real estate market. Rentals continued its strong growth, with $97 million in revenue in Q1, up 31% year-over-year.\r\nWe continue to grow our multifamily property count, with 40,000 properties at the end of the quarter, up from 37,000 at the end of December. We are well positioned for future Rentals revenue growth as we detail in our new Investor Relations deck that is a deep dive on our Rentals business. We published this new deck along with earnings today, and we'll discuss it in more detail later in this call.\r\nIn an ongoing tough rate environment, we also continued to make strong progress in Mortgages with Q1 revenue of $31 million, up 19% year-over-year, and purchase mortgage origination volume growing more than 130% year-over-year.\r\nSo in a hostile housing market and a noisy industry environment, why is Zillow outperforming? The simple answer is that Zillow is wholly focused on solving real consumer problems with software in a giant industry that has historically had very little R&D investment. Digitally replatforming and integrating a huge disparate local industry where transactions are relatively infrequent is an audacious undertaking. No other company is really even attempting it.\r\nWe are advantaged, primarily, because we are a product and technology company first and are able to attract and retain the especially talented people who know how to build, market and support great software products. This enables us to focus completely on delighting our consumers and their valued partners in pursuit of the dream of using technology to make moving simple and joyful.\r\nOur product prowess over the years has put Zillow in the enviable position of having a large engaged audience who come to us organically, an audience who love, trust and rely on our brand. This product-led organic marketing growth story is rare, but it is common for the great ones. Those are the products and brands we admire the most. Attracting a large organic audience has also given Zillow the space to experiment with business models.\r\nThose who followed us for a long time know how aggressive and innovative we have been, methodically converting our sticky audience into revenue. We have built a substantial growing, diverse and EBITDA-profitable business, yet we still monetize only a small share of our audience. Our massive unconverted audience will drive years of growth ahead for Zillow as we grow into our rightful transaction share, continue to adjust our business models and add and integrate new business lines. We have been pro-consumer, practical and nimble, and we will continue to be so. \r\nThe first era of Zillow involved amassing a large organic engaged consumer audience for whom we were providing valuable information via great sites and apps. Several years ago, we realized that our dream of digitizing the move and accessing the really big TAM in the category would involve getting much more directly involved in the transaction itself, applying software to every step of the workflow, refreshing our partner network to those who were higher performing and interested in automation and scale and building out or acquiring key components of the move process ourselves all the way from listings, photography and creation through tour booking, agent workflow, pre-approval, mortgage origination, document routing and closing. End-to-end.\r\nTo serve as an aspirational and consumer-focused north star, we created a product strategy that we call the Zillow housing super app, the experience that would integrate the whole of the complex, scary, expensive moving process. The Zillow super app is working well. Jeremy Wacksman will soon walk you through a detailed report of our growth pillars, but we see very good progress across the board on each pillar: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network, integration and rentals.\r\nAmidst all of the fear, speculation and noise, a steady focus on execution is what's working for us, delivering for our customers and partners. In terms of the noise, though, let me give some color commentary on what has transpired since our last quarterly call. The long-running class action suit against NAR and select brokerages thankfully arrived at a proposed settlement in mid-March. And the judge, just last week, granted preliminary approval of that settlement.\r\nThe substance of the settlement is what we characterized as a very reasonable middle path forward for the industry, where commissions are negotiated and communicated between sellers and buyers and both parties are better educated. This is a positive evolutionary step for the industry. It is not a revolution, as some who believe they might profit from chaos and disruption are proclaiming.\r\nClear and negotiable compensation fits quite well with our published consumer advocacy marketplace principles of free access to listings, independent representation and negotiable compensation as outlined at advocacy.zillowgroup.com. There will continue to be sensational-seeming news surrounding this settlement, no doubt, given there remains several steps in having NAR and the industry put the settlement requirements into practice. And real estate is generally a hot topic for hot takes, given it is a $2 billion to $3 trillion industry, employing millions of people in all 50 states and is most Americans' most valuable and most cherished asset.\r\nHowever, Zillow is well positioned to assist with and benefit from this evolution. So why do we expect to benefit from this evolution? For three reasons. First, we have the most and highest intent customers in residential real estate. Zillow is the most trusted brand with the largest, most engaged audience. This is a hard-earned position that we built over the past 18 years.\r\nAnd our top of funnel advantage today has never been stronger. Zillow is searched more on Google than the category term real estate, and 3x more than the next brand in the category. 80% of our traffic is organic, and our app usage is more than 3x anyone else in the category. We have more than 217 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites and 109 million total unique visitors according to comScore, a third-party data tracker that allows for comparison across sites.\r\nWe've built and maintained such a strong brand position because of our relentless focus on delivering exceptional tech innovations and customer experiences, which we believe are our most important investments. Regardless of how the industry evolves, our brand and audience will thrive.\r\nThe second reason we expect to benefit from the industry evolution? We work with the most productive agents in real estate. Of the approximately 1.5 million real estate license holders, many handle only 1 or 2 transactions a year. These are not our Premier Agent partners. 80% of all real estate transactions across the U.S. are done by the top 20% of agents or teams. And today, nearly 4 in 5 Zillow Premier Agent partners fall into that top tier.\r\nSince 2015, we have shrunk our active partner base by roughly 60%, while at the same time, our Premier Agent revenue has grown by more than 2.5x. Orienting our business around the best agent teams, those who provide superior customer experiences, have proven ability to scale and make the most money to invest alongside us, positions us well for potential shifts within the profession. If and as more hobbyist agents drop out of the industry, the upsized beneficiaries of this shift to professionalism will be our Premier Agent partners.\r\nThird reason we benefit. Zillow provides exceptional technology to make agents more efficient at their jobs and do more transactions. Zillow is the leading product innovator, with features like Real Time Touring, Listing Showcase and a digital pre-approval pilot launching within the next couple of weeks that will further delight customers and create high intent, real buyer connections for our Premier Agent partners.\r\nAdditionally, we have invested heavily in broad adoption foundational industry software solutions like our Follow Up Boss CRM, ShowingTime touring software, our Showcase 3D Home technology, Aryeo real estate photographer SaaS and dotloop document signing and writing. Over the past 10 years, between our own tech and dev budget and the acquisition capital we've deployed for industry software, we've spent $4.3 billion cumulatively investing in technology for the real estate industry.\r\nAgents who work with our high intent customers and use our industry software tools are the best positioned to accelerate their share in every version of an industry evolution from here. So the short answer for why Zillow benefits from the evolutionary changes we see coming from the NAR settlement? We have the most and highest intent customers in real estate. We work with the most productive agents and we provide them exceptional technology to make their lives more efficient.\r\nBefore handing it to Jeremy Wacksman, let me repeat for the whole of the great Zillow team in front of our investors, I'm impressed with the results you are achieving in your focused and relentless innovation for customers and partners in pursuit of a seamless digital and joyful moving experience for all. We are all in a really tough housing market and a distracting industry environment, yet our hands are steady on the wheel as we drive Zillow's business and the industry forward. Okay. Jeremy?\n\nStory continues\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been an exciting few years at Zillow, and we're pleased with the progress we're making on our strategy to transform the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes. Since 2022, we've been building the integrated transaction experience and testing it in our Enhanced Markets.\r\nNow, we are pressing on the accelerator to increase our breadth of coverage across more markets and our depth of penetration in those markets as we drive towards sustainable profitable growth. Zillow's housing super app is the container into which we're continually adding updates and improvements, guided by 5 for-sale growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services.\r\nOur for-sale growth pillars marked the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow our revenue alongside that transaction share growth. I'll kick off our growth pillar update with touring and how we are integrating the anticipated rule changes coming from the NAR settlement into our customer experience.\r\nTouring is a critical focus area for us for two reasons. First, historically, the process of booking a home tour has been burdensome. Second, when a customer raises their hand to tour a home they've been looking at on Zillow, it's a strong signal of a serious intent to transact. Our touring products, powered by ShowingTime, are meaningfully improving our ability to connect high-intent customers to our Premier Agent partners. As you may recall, touring connections convert at 3x the rate of other actions on Zillow.\r\nWe're pleased to share that Real Time Touring is rolling out to an additional 34 markets by the end of May, which will bring us to a total of 124 markets. As we outlined in February, as we expand Real Time Touring, we expect it will account for approximately 20% of connections by the end of the year, and we are on track to deliver.\r\nOne key provision of the proposed NAR settlement calls for more prominence of buyer-agent agreements introduced at the time of the physical tour. Such agreements can help educate buyers about what services they're paying for, which is a good thing, and they have the added benefit of helping identify high-intent buyers. In fact, we've been advocating for these agreements in our home state of Washington and across the country. By facilitating the use of consumer-friendly agreements earlier in the funnel, we see an opportunity to improve conversion rates.\r\nAs an example, in Connecticut, where buyer-agency agreements are required before taking a buyer on a tour, we've observed 20% higher conversion rates compared to our national average. We are testing buyer-agreement product flows now within Zillow. And just this week, we launched a pilot of a consumer-friendly buyer agreement in our touring experience with a few hundred Premier Agent partners.\r\nOffering solutions digitally on Zillow is a natural and logical addition to the end-to-end experience we're providing customers and agents. Meanwhile, we are also enabling nearly limitless virtual touring that will continually get closer and closer to reality with our proprietary technology powering 3D home tours and Showcase Listings. Leveling up physical touring alongside our investment in virtual touring is a great combination for the industry, benefiting all participants.\r\nI'll now move on to financing, another critical focus area for us, because serving more high-intent customers with financing drives conversion and increases our addressable market. By integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partner network, we are providing a more seamless experience for customers, agents and loan officers.\r\nOur efforts to integrate financing throughout the customer journey have accelerated purchase mortgage growth, with $601 million in purchased loan origination volume in Q1, a more than 130% year-over-year increase despite a persistently challenging mortgage rate environment. We expect continued purchase mortgage growth as we expand integration with Premier Agent partners and roll out more Enhanced Markets.\r\nAcross the combined 13 Enhanced Markets we had at the end of Q1, Zillow Home Loans continues to see double-digit adoption rates, which contributes to growing revenue per transaction year-over-year. These signals reinforce our confidence that our strategy is working, and I'm pleased to share that this month, we are expanding to a total of 19 Enhanced Markets, and we are on track to reach our target of 40 by the end of the year.\r\nOn the sell side of the transaction, we continue to ramp up solutions that not only make selling a home easier, but also create real value for sellers and their agents. I'll spend a minute on Listing Showcase specifically. Listing Showcase is our AI-powered product that elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and provides a better shopper experience through our homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. It's unlike anything else available today.\r\nWe continue to be excited about Listing Showcase and the progress we are making across the country. Showcase listings drive higher engagement on Zillow compared to similar non-Showcase listings. More views, more shares and more saves. But even more importantly, homes that list with Showcase are selling faster and for more money. Showcase listings typically sell for 2% more than similar non-Showcase listings on Zillow, a bonus of $9,000 on the average home.\r\nHomes listed with Showcase are also 20% more likely to secure an accepted offer within 14 days. What's more, we've observed that agents who use Listing Showcase are winning 20% more listings, making it an attractive offering for real estate professionals. Listing Showcase is currently available to agents in every market, and we are actively working to reach 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity, and we believe there is potential for future growth beyond that.\r\nWe are working to increase engagement with the best agents on both sides of the transaction, which leads me to our next growth pillar update, enhancing our partner network. As Rich highlighted earlier, Premier Agent partners represent the best of the industry, and we help them provide even better service to our shared customers to grow both their business and ours. We're excited that we continue to see transaction share gains across our 13 Enhanced Markets on a revenue per total transaction dollar basis. And now, a couple of quarters after we closed our acquisition of Follow Up Boss, we're even more excited about the opportunity for further conversion gains from here.\r\nIn addition to our five for-sale growth pillars, I want to turn the spotlight on to Rentals. Rentals is a fast-growing business that represents nearly 1/5 of our total revenue, with a lot of opportunity in front of it. To bring our great progress in Rentals out of the shadow of our for-sale efforts, we've released a stand-alone investor presentation that provides a better understanding of what we've built, where we are headed and why we are so well positioned to build a comprehensive two-sided marketplace that is unlike anything else in the industry today.\r\nLike we do with all parts of Zillow, we start our Rentals journey from the perspective of the consumer, in this case, the 17 million annual renters in the U.S., which is 3x more movers than on the for-sale side. When renters search for a rental, they want the process to be enjoyable, trustworthy and easy. But instead, it's fragmented and frustrating. That's because no single platform provides a comprehensive marketplace with anywhere near complete coverage of available rental inventory.\r\nThere is no MLS for Rentals. This forces renters to shop across different platforms, each with varying levels of accuracy, transparency and selection, and encounter dead ends when searching for inventory. That fragmentation is the big problem and the big opportunity. Renters and property managers want and need one centralized place where they can see all the rental listings available. This is an incredibly simple and obvious concept, but an incredibly hard challenge. It's a challenge Zillow is best positioned to solve because of our success over many years of building great products for our massive audience of movers on the for-sale side.\r\nThe early years of Zillow Rentals made clear that our customers wanted to come to us to shop for rentals, so in 2018, we turned our focus and ramped up our investment to build it out and create the richest, most complete Rentals marketplace. We started with long-tail rentals, which we define as less than 25 units, but primarily comprises single-family homes because data and interest in single-family was a core strength of Zillow.\r\nBecause these properties were hard to find, this offered an opportunity for us to build a unique inventory asset. It may also come as a surprise to you, but long-tail rentals are actually the majority of inventory in the rentals market. Long-tail rentals are a classic go-to-market problem: small, fragmented and local. You simply cannot efficiently deploy a sales force to go out and find all the supply.\r\nBecause Zillow was already the most trusted name in residential real estate, many of these long-tail property managers were already familiar with us and asking for these solutions. Many of them may only own 1 or 2 homes, so they're looking for a product that gets their listings in front of the most potential tenants and makes renting out their properties easier.\r\nToday, our long-tail product experience is unmatched. On Zillow, renters can search, book tours, apply for properties, sign a lease and pay their rent securely and apply for renters' insurance. Similarly, long-tail property managers on Zillow can list, book tours, screen applicants, create leases, sign them electronically and collect red payments. It's a true end-to-end solution that's highly useful to both renters and property managers alike.\r\nThese investments in great products starting in 2018 powered Zillow to the top traffic ranking in rentals and made us the preferred brand for renters. Today, Zillow is the most searched Rentals marketplace, according to Google Trends, search nearly 1.5x more than the next company in the category, and we have the leading rentals traffic with very limited marketing spend.\r\nAfter our success in long-tail, in 2022, we turned our attention to the more commodity supply subsegment of rentals: multifamily, big apartment buildings with 25 or more units. This is the easier-to-reach segment investors have historically thought of as the Rentals category, with professional property managers who have marketing and software budgets to help them acquire renters and manage buildings.\r\nSince we turned our focus to the multifamily space, we have driven a 30% compounded annual growth rate in our multifamily properties from 27,000 to 40,000 at the end of Q1 and a more than 30% CAGR in our multifamily revenue on the back of just $15 million total marketing dollars spent on Zillow Rentals.\r\nCombining unique long-tail listings with more commodity multifamily listings allows consumers a more seamless experience where they can see all types of available rental listings in one place and gives Zillow a highly differentiated Rentals marketplace experience, in which we are now ramping up our investments. In addition, many movers are dual track shopping: shopping for a home to buy while also considering their rental options. Zillow's integrated shopping experience and singular brand excel here.\r\nAs it stands today, we estimate that Zillow has more than 50% of all rental listings in the country, more than any other site, and many of them are unique to Zillow. But that still accounts for only 60% of all long-tail listings and 35% of multifamily listings across the country. So we are investing in our Rentals products, services and sales to drive further growth. For example, in March, we entered into a strategic partnership with Realtor.com to provide all the multifamily listings on their site, and we recently launched our first national marketing campaign after a successful pilot last year in a few markets, which tested well, to grow our audience.\r\nAs with other parts of our business, 2024 is a year to scale up our breadth and depth in Rentals to drive continued growth in listings, both long-tail and importantly, multifamily. With the largest audience of renters on the market, a 42% revenue CAGR since 2015 and a $1 billion-plus revenue opportunity in front of us, Zillow Rentals is digitally organizing a large, fragmented local marketplace highly valued by all participants.\r\nOne quarter into the year, we are pleased with our execution and controlling what we can against a noisy external backdrop. And with that, I will now pass the microphone to Jeremy Hofmann, who will provide a closer look at our results.\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nThanks, Jeremy, and hello, everyone. As you heard from Rick and Jeremy, we are pleased with how we are executing on our strategy, and our results once again demonstrate that our strategy is working well. I will start with our Q1 2024 results, which exceeded expectations across the business for revenue and EBITDA.\r\nRevenue growth accelerated in Q1, up 13% year-over-year to $529 million, which was $26 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. The broader residential real estate industry grew 4% in the quarter, according to data from NAR, meaning that we outperformed the category by 900 basis points. Each of our revenue categories across Residential, Mortgages and Rentals contributed to our outperformance.\r\nOn a GAAP basis, Q1 net loss was $23 million, representing 4% of our revenue. EBITDA was $125 million for the quarter, resulting in a 24% EBITDA margin, a year-over-year margin expansion of 200 basis points. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results despite a macro housing environment that remains constrained.\r\nOur Q1 Residential revenue of $393 million outperformed our outlook range, and revenue growth accelerated to 9% year-over-year. Premier Agent benefited from the ongoing investments in our top and mid-funnel experiences that drove improvements in our overall connection rates. Additionally, our growth was driven by accelerating growth in our new construction business, growth in ShowingTime+ as we began our nationwide rollout of Listing Showcase, with additional contributions from Follow Up Boss.\r\nRentals revenue grew 31% year-over-year in Q1 to $97 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 46% year-over-year. Our Rental strategy is working well, and our team is executing on growing the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites, which reached an all-time high of 40,000 multifamily properties as of the end of Q1. Total listings across our entire Rentals marketplace were up 20% year-over-year to an industry-leading 1.8 million listings in March.\r\nMortgages revenue of $31 million in Q1 was up 19% year-over-year, with purchase loan origination volume growing more than 130% year-over-year to $601 million. Our mortgage strategy is to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans, which continues to drive our growing share of purchase originations, even in a difficult macroeconomic environment, evidenced by total industry purchase loan originations being down 10% year-over-year per our internal data.\r\nEBITDA expenses in Q1 totaled $404 million, flat sequentially from Q4 and at the midpoint of our implied outlook range as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Cost of revenue, which is included in EBITDA expenses, increased $31 million or 34% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continue to test and release new products as well as increases in mortgage loan processing costs due to higher purchase loan origination volume.\r\nWe ended Q1 with $2.9 billion of cash and investments, up from $2.8 billion at the end of Q4, primarily driven by net cash provided by operating activities. As of the end of Q1, we had $1.6 billion of outstanding convertible debt. We repurchased $9 million of shares during Q1, and we were opportunistic in the month of April, repurchasing an additional 2.1 million shares for $91 million. Collectively, we have repurchased a total of $100 million of shares year-to-date.\r\nTurning to our outlook for Q2. We estimate the residential real estate industry total transaction value will be roughly flat year-over-year, which is down sequentially from the 4% year-over-year growth we saw in Q1. We expect total company revenue to be between $525 million and $540 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 5% at the midpoint of our outlook range.\r\nFor Residential, we expect revenue to be between $372 million to $382 million. Our Residential revenue outlook for Q2 is down sequentially based on two headwinds. The first is that first-time homebuyer activity has underperformed the overall mortgage buyer market year-to-date. A good indicator of first-time homebuyer activity is the MBA's FHA Mortgage Purchase Application Index. Because our customer base leans toward first-time homebuyers, this is an index we watch closely. Over the past 6 weeks, we have seen the Index underperform the overall Mortgage Purchase Index by over 800 basis points.\r\nThe second is recent moves in interest rates. We have seen some headwinds as Premier Agent partners take a wait-and-see approach as interest rates have spiked by more than 50 basis points over the last few weeks, and first-time homebuyers are a lower percentage of the overall home buying mix.\r\nMoving to Rentals. We expect our Rentals revenue to grow in the mid-20% range year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the strength of our execution, a favorable industry backdrop driving property manager demand for advertising and the launch of our first national rentals brand awareness campaign. Within Rentals, we expect multifamily revenue to grow faster than the overall business as we add more properties, sell more subscription packages and benefit from the investments we are making in our renter experience.\r\nFor Mortgages, we expect accelerated year-over-year revenue growth in the high 20% range. We remain on track to further integrate Premier Agent and Zillow Home Loans with our planned Enhanced Markets expansion. As capacity is built within these Enhanced Markets, we expect to send more of our mortgage leads to Zillow Home Loans directly as well as drive engagement with more consumers on our apps and sites to grow our origination volumes. We expect origination revenue to become both a larger portion of Mortgages revenue and a larger driver of the category's revenue growth going forward as a result.\r\nFor Q2, we expect EBITDA to be between $85 million and $100 million, equating to a 17% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from $404 million in Q1 to an estimated $440 million in Q2, which is what we expected in our full year plan. Roughly 85% of the increase is being driven by a combination of a seasonal uptick in our brand marketing spend and increased marketing spend to accelerate our Rentals growth strategy. The balance of the increase is coming from staffing of variable head count for sales given the growth we expect in Rentals, Listing Showcase and Zillow Home Loans throughout 2024.\r\nMoving on to the full year. I want to reiterate that we expect double-digit revenue growth for 2024, primarily driven by our growth pillars, with modest EBITDA margin expansion for the year. Our announced Rentals brand campaign is something we had factored in when we initially provided this framework in February. Based on our Q1 results and our expected Q2 performance, we expect to outpace our internal plan for both revenue and EBITDA in the first half of 2024.\r\nOn the cost side, we continue to believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation and our variable costs growing ahead of revenue initially as we ramp up new hires to be fully productive. Advertising spend is a lever we treat as separate and distinct from the rest of the cost base and one we will pull, depending on the growth opportunities we see in front of us. Clearly, Rentals is an opportunity we think deserves amplified marketing dollars, and we are excited about what the campaign will bring for our future growth.\r\nTo close, it is clear we are executing on our strategy. We are seeing growth across Residential, Rentals and Mortgages. We are also seeing great results from our growth pillars and our Enhanced Markets that will continue to roll out throughout this year. We are on track to grow revenue double digits and expand margins, all against a macro backdrop that is worse than many forecasted. And with that, operator, we'll open up the line for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Our first question comes from Brad Erickson with RBC.\n\nBradley D. Erickson\n\nI guess two for me. One, obviously, it sounds like the Residential business has slowed down here. You mentioned the full year guide, though, hasn't really changed. So I guess, steeper second half ramp implied. Clearly, you guys are investing in Rentals, and that was baked in. But I think relative to last quarter, maybe just talk about your confidence in that second half ramp. And besides Rentals, what else is kind of instructing that confidence on maintaining the guidance?\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes. Thanks, Brad. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take that one. I think similar to what we've said in the past, we don't over focus on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, just given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. What gives us confidence is we're outperforming our internal plan. We expect to do so with what we guided for the second quarter and expect to do so for the first half of the year on both revenue and EBITDA.\r\nAnd when I look at our strategy and what we're executing across, we feel really confident that the second half is going to accelerate and will grow double digits against the flattish housing market. And that comes from a few factors. So I think first, more contributions from our Enhanced Markets will come in the second half as they come online, and that's all back half weighted.\r\nWe're seeing continued share gains and positive signals in the 13 Enhanced Markets to date. Jeremy hit that earlier, but across revenue per total transaction value and customer adoption rate. So we feel good there. Mortgages, we expect to continue to accelerate. Showcase is rolling out nationwide and accelerating. And then obviously, Rentals is growing quite nicely, and we expect that to continue as well. So that's what gives us the confidence around the reacceleration that we expect to see in the second half.\n\nBradley D. Erickson\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just secondarily on the regulatory front, specifically around the buyers' agreement. You mentioned that arrangement and the product you announced, I guess it was yesterday, leading to maybe higher conversion rates. I think there's some investor concern out there where there's still going to be some friction, maybe higher up in the funnel. Can you kind of talk about how you manage that part of it and maybe why it's not a headwind relative to kind of how the old way used to work?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. Brad, it's Jeremy Wacksman. Yes, as I said earlier, I mean, we see this as a great opportunity. What we're testing is post connection, right? So after a consumer has already requested, or in the Real Time Touring case, booked a tour, can we help educate them and provide them a really consumer-friendly digital education agreement?\r\nAnd we see that as better educating the customer and also expectation setting the customer for when they meet the agent as what to expect from the agent, both in that initial relationship but in what they might expect in a buyer-agency agreement generally. And any time we can help educate a customer, that typically leads to a higher quality customer for our agents. We've seen that as we've built things like touring and Real Time Touring. And I gave the example earlier, in states that have been using agreements earlier in the funnel, you typically see higher conversion rates.\r\nThe Connecticut example is a good one. It's 90% of buyers are using buyer-agents and the conversion rates are higher. So I think important to frame it in the context of this is down in the funnel once the customer has already raised their hand, really declared their intent. We've worked with them to make sure we're getting them to the right place. They've had this magical book a tour experience, and they're getting ready to go. And this is an additional education opportunity. It's not friction.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now turn to John Campbell with Stephens.\n\nJohn Robert Campbell\n\nJust back to the new Zillow touring agreement, that's a pretty clever development. Congrats on getting that to market. I want to touch on two items related to that. So first, if there are agents that are unwilling to adopt that new touring agreement, will those agents simply lose the ability to get tour requests through ShowingTime?\r\nAnd then secondly, just more broadly, how important do you feel the role of touring is for your journey of moving from 3% of transactions to 6%?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes, this is Jeremy. I'll hit both. It's optional, right? So it's not something that Zillow is required to do. That's why I said we see it as opportunity. It's an educational step. At some point in the experience, the agent is going to have a conversation with the customer about services and start an agreement in our relationship. We're trying to help facilitate that. So we don't expect any fall-off or friction because it is an optional experience. And that said, we're prototyping and testing. We'll learn a lot as we work with our first couple of hundred agent partners and customers, and we'll iterate from there.\r\nSo -- and then to your second question, we see touring as, again, as we've talked about for a while, it's the #1 thing customers want to do. That's why we're so excited about it. That's why it's one of our growth pillars and one of the drivers of the performance gains we've seen in our Enhanced Markets to date and the overall share gains we expect to see as we roll out to more markets.\r\nThat is both physical touring, which we've talked about here, and virtual touring, right? So getting customers a deeper sense of home, helping them figure out what they want to go see in person helps higher-quality customers be more educated, informed when they raise their hands, that helps our agents win more of those customers when they meet them and drive transaction share.\r\nSo we're excited about the opportunity the changes the evolution Rich talked about provide. This is one of the first ways in which we're trying to leverage and help make those marriages between consumers and agents happen.\n\nJohn Robert Campbell\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then one more to tack on here on Matterport. I mean, obviously, it looks like it's heading to one of your competitors. I know you're not going to probably comment on pending transaction or maybe what that ripple effect, call it, for the market. But maybe if you could just talk to your own 3D tour capabilities and how you feel that stacks up?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. We are really excited about our own homegrown 3D tech. We're excited about virtual touring generally. We support Matterport today. It's a small percentage of listings today, and our 3D technology is on a small percentage of listings today. And that virtual touring capability is going to continue to grow as consumers discover, love it and as we all improve our own technologies. So we're really happy with our homegrown effort. And as you know, that is what powers Listing Showcase and all of the really unique interactive floor plan, AI-generated listings I talked about earlier that drive a ton more buyer engagement and are helping listings go pending and sell faster and sell for more money.\r\nSo we love the investment that we're making here, and we really see this as where the consumer experience is going. But it's early, and all of us are small. And retraining the consumer to allow more touring in the virtual world, we think, complements the physical touring investments we're making. Again, back to the earlier conversation, helping consumers find what they want to buy, helping them dream and shop more online and their app and getting them into the hands of our great agent partners.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now turn to Ron Josey with Citigroup.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nRich, I wanted to ask on the Rentals business, only because clearly it's a big strategic priority and the deck was very helpful, and on a $400 million run rate currently, and I think the view is to get to that $1 billion, if I read the deck correctly, in revenue.\r\nSo I wanted to maybe focus more on multifamily growth, and we talked about, I think, 35% penetration of the, call it, those that are available properties to 40,000 properties today. Just talk to us about the life cycle for getting these multifamily properties onto the platform, the importance to Rentals for first-time buyers?\r\nAnd then maybe as a quick follow-up to that, how Rentals -- it's been a big business for Zillow for a while, creates a deeper relationship with Zillow over, call it, the entire housing process of a person. And I have a quick follow-up.\n\nRichard N. Barton\n\nRon, guys, maybe I'll start out with a little bit of a strategy answer and then Jeremy Wacksman, maybe talk about -- or Jeremy Hofmann will talk about the multifamily question that Ron asked.\r\nYes, we -- I really love the Rentals play as you know, Ron. It is a textbook example of a two-sided digital marketplace opportunity. It's the kind of opportunity that our Board Director, Bill Gurley, who many of you know, who's really a thought leader on digital marketplaces, would really love. It turns out that I've been roughly involved in -- intimately involved in building several kind of successful digital marketplaces since the dawn of the Internet as well, and it makes me excited. So let me just tick through why.\r\nOne, it's hyper-fragmented and locally distributed inventory on the supply side of the marketplace. Likewise, it's really fragmented on the renter or the demand side of the marketplace, okay? Also, there is volatile pricing and volatile availability, which promotes market monitoring, so high engagement from both sides of the marketplace. Additionally, there is heavy shopper interest in content as both practical and for entertainment as part of the shopping process, which lends itself well to a digital marketplace. Very high gross margin, which we all, as investors love. And finally, marketplaces have a positive network effect, which is more supply begets more demand, which begets more supply.\r\nSo we're seeing all of those things in action here in our rental marketplace. We knew from the beginning that acquiring demand at a really reasonable price, basically near 0 marginal expense, is key to making these kinds of marketplaces work, and that keeping the supply side inventory acquisition costs very low is going to be key as well, and we feel very good on both of those.\r\nOn the demand side, it's pretty simple. Zillow Rentals has kind of ridden the long and lovely coattails of the greater Zillow with our 200 million-plus monthly uniques, and lots of them also interested in buying a home as well as renting. So we've been able to leverage that. And on the supply side, it took us many years of kind of toiling in the dark in the long-tail where most of the rental inventory is in single-family homes in the long-tail, but now after toiling for many years, we estimate we have about 60% of those, and they're unique. These are almost all listings that will only be showing up inside of Zillow Rentals, which is fantastic.\r\nSo more recently, I'll hand it off to Jeremy here, we turned our guns to the kind of more obvious and more commodity apartments in tall buildings in cities market, the multifamily market. This is the market segment with real marketing budgets and professional managers. We have 40,000 buildings now. It's growing really rapidly. We love that. Why don't I -- so I'll conclude by saying, yes, we've got the supply -- the expense of the supply side nailed and the inventory now kind of lit up, and we've certainly got the demand side in a terrific spot, and we're -- I'm personally excited to begin to really lean into this. Jeremy, you want to chat a bit about multifamily?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. I mean I think the answer is similar to the framework you gave around it being a two-sided marketplace. We have been building the overall organic traffic and listings for the renter experience, and that's driven the demand side broadly. Now we're focusing in on increasing demand, more specifically in multifamily, and you're seeing that both in our partnership with Realtor.com and in our advertising campaign following a really successful test last year. And that's on the demand side of Rich's two-sided marketplace.\r\nAnd then the supply side is bringing those high-intent renters to the professionals Rich talked about and increasing our sales efforts to go help those folks connect with our renters and get what they need from their advertising dollars. So it is really about the flywheel Rich talked about, and it's just the focus in on multifamily on both the demand side and the supply side that we're now turning more focus and energy to.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now turn to Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\n\nOkay. Let me try a few, please. The Q2 guide, you don't have this kind of outpacing of real estate industry total transaction value that you've had pretty consistently for a while. Maybe you covered this before, but if not, could you please go through that? Why wouldn't you outpace?\r\nAnd then on the Showcase new listings, can you just talk about what kind of traction you're seeing with that? I know you covered a little bit in the shareholder letter, but reactions you've had to the pricing models that you rolled out at the beginning of the year?\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes. Thanks, Mark. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll take the first one on the guide. Yes, we called out a few factors that are headwinds right now. One is first-time homebuyers are just struggling in this market. And we lean that way, so we're feeling that a bit. And then additionally, just when rates spike like this as quickly as they did over the past few weeks, our Premier Agent partners just tend to be in a more of a wait-and-see environment. So we're feeling both of those at the moment.\r\nThis is not dissimilar from what we felt this time 2 years ago, where PA partners took a bit of a wait-and-see approach when rates spiked and then ultimately, we worked through it. So like I said earlier, not necessarily too focused on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and just reiterating that we think revenue reaccelerates in the back half of the year to get us to that double digits revenue growth against the flattish housing market. We continue to feel good there for a variety of reasons, just the way that we're executing across Residential, Mortgages, Showcase and Rentals as well. And then, Jeremy, maybe I'll pass to you.\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. I can hit Listing Showcase. Yes, I mean, as I said earlier, we're really excited that the increased engagement from the buyers continues, right? So more page views, saves and shares as we get showcased out there more and more. We're also now seeing seller benefit, which I talked about. So homes are selling faster, 20% more likely to accept an offer in 14 days, and they're selling for more money, 2% more money. And most importantly, agents who are using with Listing Showcases are winning more listings.\r\nSo all that says to us that as we've been rolling this out and scaling this up and offering in more locations, we're seeing a really good product market fit, both with -- we knew with buyers, we're now seeing with sellers and with sellers' agents. And that's why we're so excited about the intermediate-term goal we've talked to you all about and getting ourselves to 5% to 10% total active listings because then we think there's potentially more to do once this gets to that state.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\n\nDo you have markets where that coverage is materially higher, like a lead market where it's materially higher than 5% to 10%?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nNot yet. I mean, we've talked to you all about it for a while now, but it's important to remember it's only been live for a couple of quarters, and it's only been live nationally since February. So team has grown, as Jeremy talked about. We have staffed up sales folks to start to hit more coverage and talk to agents in more places. But as much as we're excited about it, as much as we see a really exciting product here, it is still really early in our journey.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now turn to Ryan McKeveny with Zelman & Associates.\n\nRyan McKeveny\n\nOn Follow Up Boss, you mentioned in the letter being even more excited about the opportunity for conversion gains. I guess if you could provide kind of two sides of an update. One would just be initial receptiveness and maybe retention of legacy Follow Up Boss customers post the acquisition.\r\nAnd then secondarily, I know it's only been a handful of months, but where does integration stand with the PA business? And anything to call out about any benefits to conversion rates thus far? Or is that more opportunity as we move forward?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. Thanks, Ryan. I think on initial reception, we've been really pleased with the retention of the core customers of Follow Up Boss as we've gotten through closing and integration and starting to work together now for a couple of quarters. And we're really pleased to just see the continued positive agent feedback on the Follow Up Boss product. I still get anecdotes all the time, talking to agents, about how much they love it and how much they're excited about our ability to help the Follow Up Boss team grow and invest more in this team-focused CRM that they've built their business on. So we continue to be pleased with the post-close post-acquisition performance of the Follow Up Boss agent base.\r\nAnd then on your second question, I would say it's still a lot of opportunity. I mean I think you heard both me and Jeremy talk about in the prepared remarks, they're starting to ship things for all advertising partners. Or sorry, all agent partners, and we're also starting to think about ways to help Premier Agent partners use Follow Up Boss to better convert their business, both -- they're Zillow customers, but they're entire customers.\r\nSo not too much more to share in terms of road map, but a whole lot of excited folks internally in both the Follow Up Boss team and our Zillow consumer and Zillow agent teams ideating and working together on how can we help our agents use technology to convert more customers and deliver better service. And we see a long road ahead for that initiative.\n\nRyan McKeveny\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on the 2Q revenue guide in Residential and the comment about some partners taking a wait-and-see approach. I guess if I step back, there's the industry noise related to all the litigation and everything that's going on. There's noise on the competitive side of things, neither of which seemed to be kind of the called out headwinds.\r\nSo maybe just help us think through that disaggregation of the headwinds in a bit more detail. Like is there any change on the margin coming from competitive/industry types of dynamics? Or at this point in time, is the best estimation that it's largely kind of macro-related factors at this point in time?\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes. Thanks, Ryan. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I think we monitor our sales funnel really, really closely, and we have software that sits over top of it, monitoring agent calls and agent sentiment and just telling us what they're hearing. And the situation right now is just -- it's a temporary rate shock. We've been through that before. It happened in the spring of 2022, and we know how to navigate through it. We want to be there for our partners during this time and not necessarily going to push too hard as a result of that.\r\nAnd then with respect to NAR and competitive, we're just not seeing that in any data that we see. We just don't see impact from either of those. So it really has been much more macro related and macro in a way that we think is navigable. And again, coming back to the full year, we just continue to feel quite good about the ability to accelerate revenue over the course of the year and let us get through the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations just given how fluid macro is.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now turn to Chris Kuntarich with UBS.\n\nChristopher Louis Kuntarich\n\nTwo-parter on the Rental business. Just as we think about this $1 billion-plus opportunity for Rentals, last quarter, you'd frame Listing Showcases kind of a medium-term $150 million to $300 million opportunity. Should we be thinking about this also as a medium term? Or is this more of a kind of a longer-term opportunity?\r\nAnd the second part of the question would be just as we think about the pace of Rentals growth in '24, how should we be thinking about pricing as a lever you could potentially pull?\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes. I'll take it. It's is Jeremy Hofmann. I think on the $1 billion-plus opportunity, I think the keyword there is sustainable. We think it's a sustainable $1 billion plus opportunity. And we've built the business that way. Rich walked through a bunch of why we like the strategy so much. But we also like it as a multi-decade type opportunity. So with respect to timing, we're not going to commit to anything there. We just believe there's a lot more for us to do.\r\nAnd we think what we're building is differentiated versus anybody else. And we have an opportunity to be the place where all renters come and all property managers come as well. Whether that's in the single-family or multifamily category, that's where we think the opportunity is. And done under one brand, Zillow, right? That's already known for housing. So that's what we're focused on. I just want to give you a sense for what we see over time.\r\nAnd then secondly, on 2024 for Rentals, the goal is really keep adding more and more properties and bringing more demand alongside. So we think of it as more of an effort that way than pushing on price. It's really -- we just see a pretty substantial opportunity in front of us, and we want to make sure we continue to add properties at the way that we have been and then also bringing the consumer demand to satisfy those properties.\r\nSo the organic efforts that we have, the Realtor.com partnership, which went live today, and then this national marketing campaign we're quite excited about as well, all in the vein of how do we make sure we build something really sustainable over time? And we think we're on that path.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today comes from Dae Lee with JPMorgan.\n\nDae K. Lee\n\nSo back to the NAR settlement, I mean, is this something that you or your partners are anticipating having a meaningful disruption around the time of implementation? Or could this be more of a change that takes a while for you guys to see?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nThis is Jeremy. I can hit that. I mean, I think no. I think as Rich outlined earlier, we don't see a ton of revolutionary change here. We see more evolutionary change that results in more educated and more transparent consumers, which we see as leading to higher quality, higher intent leads and connections for our partners. And I think we're seeing -- that's already started to play out in the early innings after all the news is cleared of how partners are processing connections and how they're learning to work with those consumers.\r\nAnd as I talked about, just take our touring pilot here as an example of leaning in on consumer education in a consumer-friendly way to help them understand what they're going to be dealing with. And in the states that have been doing that, seeing still fairly ubiquitous independent representation and higher conversion rates.\r\nSo as folks like us and others roll out more buy (inaudible) agreements, again, back to our principles, we think a more educated consumer who can understand what they're getting from their representation that they choose and understand that the compensation is fair and negotiable and can be negotiated, that leads to a better conversation with professionals.\r\nAnd we think that leads to our professionals, which as Rich talked about, are a small subset of the most productive agents winning more business. And so we see that anecdotally today, and we see that in some of the states that we're further ahead on this today, and we expect to see that, that continue as more folks roll out changes to deal with the evolution.\n\nDae K. Lee\n\nGot it. And as a follow-up, I don't know if you'll address this, though, but like what's driving the first-time homebuyer activity underperformance? I mean is it just related to the mortgage rates hike? Or is there something else happening? And -- [2Q volumes] (inaudible) activities stays at these levels?\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes, it's Jeremy Hofmann, just to make sure I heard it. Yes, I mean, really, it is the rate shock that we felt. It's less about the absolute interest rate level, it's more the shock. And when rates spiked by 50 basis points over a couple of week period, first-time homebuyers are the folks that feel that the most, and they're underperforming pretty significantly. We don't expect that to be forever, but it is a temporal thing. And as a result, it's a bit of a headwind for us, but one that we think we can navigate through pretty seamlessly.\n\nOperator\n\nThis completes the allotted time for questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.\n\nRichard N. Barton\n\nAll right. Thanks, everybody. Look, it's noisy out there, and there is a lot of confusion and there's a lot of distraction. And I'll tell you, we're calm. We're driving forward. We're putting up numbers. The product is getting better and better, and we have a long road ahead of us because of all of this incredible kind of pent-up potential transaction energy that lives inside of our wonderful marketplace. So it's noisy, but we're feeling really good. Thanks for being on the road with us. We'll talk to you soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Zillow believes the evolution of the industry will only help it grow",
        "content": "zillow-lenders\n\nIn light of the jury verdict in the Sitzer/Burnett suit and the terms of the National Association of Realtor\u2019s nationwide settlement agreement of the commission lawsuits, several prominent industry analysts believe Zillow will struggle with its financial performance.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, during the firm\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings call with investor and analysts, CEO Rich Barton took a contrary view: Zillow is just beginning to unlock its revenue generating potential.\n\n\u201cIn a hostile housing market and a noisy industry environment, why is Zillow outperforming?\u201d he posited. \u201cThe simple answer is that Zillow is wholly focused on solving real consumer problems with software. In a giant industry that has historically had very little R&D investment, digitally re-platforming and integrating a huge disparate local industry where transactions are relatively infrequent is an audacious undertaking. We are advantaged primarily because we are a product and technology company first.\u201d\n\nWhile Zillow\u2019s net loss of $23 million for the quarter, which was up from its net loss of $22 million in Q1 2023, did not necessarily reflect Barton\u2019s confidence, the firm\u2019s 13% annual increase in revenue to $529 million did. During the first quarter of 2024, Zillow recorded revenue growth across all sectors of its business, including a 31% annual jump in its rentals revenue to $97 million and a 19% year-over-year increase in its mortgage revenue to $31 million.\n\nZillow\u2019s residential revenue, which still makes up the vast majority of the company\u2019s revenue, also posted an increase, rising 9% on a yearly basis to $393 million.\n\nOn the call, Barton said that Zillow\u2019s technology has helped it earn consumer trust, putting it \u201cin the enviable position of having a large enough audience\u201d that comes organically.\n\n\u201cThe product led organic marketing growth story is rare, but it is common for the great ones. Those are the products and brands we admire the most,\u201d Barton said. \u201cThose who have followed us for a long time know how aggressive and innovative we have been, methodically converting our sticky audience into revenue. We have built a substantial, growing, diverse, EBITDA profitable business, yet we still monetize only a small share of our audience. Our massive unconverted audience will drive years of growth ahead for Zillow.\u201d\n\nBarton also touched upon the terms of NAR\u2019s settlement agreement. According to Barton, the \u201csubstance of the settlement\u201d is a \u201cvery reasonable middle path forward for the industry, where commissions are communicated between sellers and buyers and both parties are better educated.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis is a positive evolutionary step for the industry,\u201d Barton added.\n\nHowever, Barton noted that he and the team at Zillow do not see the changes outlined in NAR\u2019s settlement agreement as revolutionary.\n\n\u201cClear and negotiable compensation fits quite well with our published consumer advocacy marketplace principles of free access to listings, independent representation and negotiable compensation,\u201d Barton said.\n\nAs such, Barton said he is confident that Zillow will benefit from this evolution.\n\n\u201cWe have the most and highest intent customers in real estate, we work with the most productive agents and we provide them with exceptional technology to make their lives more efficient,\u201d Barton said.\n\nIn particular, Barton highlighted Zillow\u2019s Premier Agent program, which sells buy-side leads to agents who are part of the Premier Agent network. Due to this program\u2019s heavy reliance on homebuyers using real estate agents in their homebuying journey, some analysts have become critical of this model in light of the commission lawsuits.\n\n\u201cOf the approximately 1.5 million real estate license holders, many handle only one or two transactions a year. These are not our Premier Agent partners,\u201d Barton said. \u201cEighty-percent of all real estate transactions across the U.S. are done by the top 20% of agents and team and today, nearly four out of five Zillow Premier Agent partners fall into that top tier.\u201d\n\nBarton added that since 2015, Zillow has shrunk its Premier Agent partner base by roughly 60%, while increased its Premier Agent revenue by more than 2.5 times.\n\nZillow executives also discussed its newly launched \u201cTouring Contract,\u201d noting that prospective homebuyers would not be required by Zillow to sign its touring contract in order book a home tour.\n\n\u201cSuch agreement can help educated buyers about what services they are paying for, which is a good thing, and they have the added benefit of helping identify high intent buyers,\u201d Jeremy Wacksman, the chief operating officer at Zillow, said of buyer representation agreements.\n\nLooking ahead, Zillow executives said they are continuing to focus on the firm\u2019s five growth pillars of touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing its partner network and rentals.\n\n\u201cIt is noisy out there and there is a lot of confusion and there is a lot of distraction, but I\u2019ll tell you that we are calm,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe are driving forward, we are putting up numbers, the product is bettering better and better and we have a long road ahead of us because of all of this incredible kind of pent up potential transaction energy that lives inside our wonderful marketplace.\u201d\n\nView comments",

The company released these details in its 8-K filing, showcasing a robust performance across its varied business segments. Zillow Group, a leading digital real estate platform, continues to redefine the home buying, selling, renting, and financing landscapes through technological innovation and strategic market expansion.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nZillow Group Inc operates a suite of real estate brands on the Internet, including Zillow, Trulia, and others, offering comprehensive services to buyers, sellers, renters, and lenders. The company's approach combines advanced technology with essential services to streamline the real estate transaction process, making it more accessible and efficient for all parties involved.\n\nFinancial Performance Highlights\n\nZillow Group's revenue for Q1 2024 reached $529 million, marking a 13% increase from $469 million in the same quarter the previous year.

        "content": "Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) Exceeds Q1 Expectations But Stock Drops\n\nOnline real estate marketplace Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) reported Q1 CY2024 results topping analysts' expectations , with revenue up 12.8% year on year to $529 million. It made a GAAP loss of $0.10 per share, down from its loss of $0.09 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zillow? Find out in our full research report.\n\nZillow (ZG) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $529 million vs analyst estimates of $507.7 million (4.2% beat) EPS: -$0.10 vs analyst expectations of -$0.08 (23.4% miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 76.7%, down from 80.4% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $41 million, down 21.2% from the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $10.02 billion\n\nFounded by Expedia co-founders Lloyd Frink and Rich Barton, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) is the leading U.S. online real estate marketplace.\n\nReal Estate Services\n\nTechnology has been a double-edged sword in real estate services. On the one hand, internet listings are effective at disseminating information far and wide, casting a wide net for buyers and sellers to increase the chances of transactions. On the other hand, digitization in the real estate market could potentially disintermediate key players like agents who use information asymmetries to their advantage.\n\nSales Growth\n\nExamining a company's long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Zillow's annualized revenue growth rate of 6.1% over the last five years was weak for a consumer discretionary business. Zillow Total Revenue\n\nWithin consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends. That's why we also follow short-term performance. Zillow's recent history shows a reversal from its already weak five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 57.7% over the last two years.\n\nThis quarter, Zillow reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 12.8%, and its $529 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 4.2%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 12.1% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nStory continues\n\nCash Is King\n\nIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nOver the last two years, Zillow has shown terrific cash profitability, enabling it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition while maintaining a robust cash balance. The company's free cash flow margin has been among the best in the consumer discretionary sector, averaging 29.3%. Zillow Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nZillow's free cash flow came in at $41 million in Q1, equivalent to a 7.8% margin and down 33.9% year on year.\n\nKey Takeaways from Zillow's Q1 Results\n\nWe enjoyed seeing Zillow exceed analysts' revenue and EBITDA expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its number of website/mobile app visits fell short of Wall Street's projections. The company did not provide any guidance. Overall, the results could have been better. The company is down 9.1% on the results and currently trades at $37.65 per share.\n\nZillow may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Zillow Group Inc. shares fell after the real estate company published a second-quarter outlook that called for lower revenue in its core business and predicted stalling growth in the broader US housing market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East Tesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market NYPD Arrests Over 300 Protesters in Crackdown on College Campuses Jerome Powell Offered Markets a Reprieve. It Vanished in a Blink The Ozempic Effect: How a Weight Loss Wonder Drug Gobbled Up an Entire Economy\n\nZillow, led by Chief Executive Officer Rich Barton, expects revenue from its residential business to be between $372 million to $382 million in the second quarter, according to a shareholder letter Wednesday. That\u2019s less than the $393 million that the company took in during the first three months of the year.\n\nZillow based that projection on tepid first-time homebuying activity and a recent rise in mortgage rates, predicting that overall US transaction volumes in the residential real estate market would be little changed from the second quarter of last year.\n\nShares plummeted as much as 12% to $36.63 before paring losses in after-market trading Wednesday at 4:55 p.m. in New York. Shares had fallen 27% from the start of the year through Wednesday\u2019s close, before earnings were released.\n\nZillow\u2019s disappointing outlook comes as the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts\u2019 expectations. The company\u2019s dominant consumer brand helped it muddle through a period of slow sales and looming changes in the US housing industry. Zillow had revenue of $529 million, more than the $509 million analysts estimated, on average, in a survey compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nZillow continues to attract eyeballs even as home sales and available listings remain near historic lows. About 217 million unique users visited the company\u2019s websites and apps on the average month in the quarter. The company, whose main business revolves around connecting prospective homebuyers with real estate agents, reported $125 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, beating the average analyst estimate of $104 million.\n\nThe residential real estate industry has been jolted in recent months by antitrust litigation that seeks to upend a decades-old status quo. In March, the National Association for Realtors agreed to a settlement that would change the way agents are paid, potentially slashing commission income for the agents who remain Zillow\u2019s core customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nZillow is positioned to thrive amid industry changes because of its large audience of high-intent homebuyers, and because it caters to the most-productive agents, Barton and Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Hofmann said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with shares, outlook details starting in first paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

(NASDAQ: Z and ZG), which is transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes, today announced its consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Zillow Group logo, April 2019 (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nComplete financial results for the first quarter and outlook for the second quarter of 2024 can be found in our shareholder letter on the Investor Relations section of Zillow Group's website at https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx.\n\n\"Zillow's strong revenue numbers across the business helped us once again meaningfully outperform the residential real estate industry as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and expand the breadth and depth of market coverage for the housing super app experience in 2024,\" said Zillow co-founder and CEO Rich Barton. \"We've organically amassed and maintained a large, engaged audience and strong brand, and we've been investing heavily in software to digitize and integrate the end-to-end moving transaction for consumers, their agents, and their loan officers.\"\n\nRecent highlights include:\n\nZillow Group's first-quarter results exceeded the company's outlook for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nQ1 revenue was $529 million, up 13% year over year and above the midpoint of the company's outlook range by $26 million.\n\nResidential revenue was up 9% year over year in Q1 to $393 million, outperforming both the residential real estate industry total transaction value1 growth of 4% and the company's outlook.  Rentals revenue of $97 million increased 31% year over year, primarily driven by multifamily revenue growing 46% year over year in Q1.  Mortgages revenue of $31 million increased 19% year over year, due primarily to a more than 130% year-over-year increase in purchase loan origination volume to $601 million in Q1. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage marketplace revenue.  On a GAAP basis, net loss was $23 million, or 4% of total revenue, in Q1, compared with $22 million, or 5% of total revenue, in Q1 2023.\n\nQ1 Adjusted EBITDA was $125 million, or 24% of total revenue, $25 million above the midpoint of the company's outlook range, driven primarily by higher-than-expected Residential revenue.\n\nCash and investments at the end of Q1 were $2.9 billion, up from $2.8 billion at the end of Q4 2023.\n\nTraffic to Zillow Group's mobile apps and sites in Q1 was 217 million average monthly unique users, flat year over year.

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measure.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\n\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;\n\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment costs;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and\n\nOther companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash-flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss, for each of the periods presented (in millions, unaudited):\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nMarch 31, 2024 2023 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss: Net loss $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (23) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (22) Income taxes 2 \u2014 Other income, net (33) (32) Depreciation and amortization 56 40 Share-based compensation 108 103 Impairment costs 6 6 Interest expense 9 9 Adjusted EBITDA $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 125 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 104 Cision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-group-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-302133486.html\n\nSOURCE Zillow Group, Inc.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "4 In 10 Los Angeles Renters Fear Eviction Because Of High Rents",
        "content": "4 In 10 Los Angeles Renters Fear Eviction Because Of High Rents\n\nNearly 4 in 10 Los Angeles County apartment renters fear they will face eviction and homelessness in the next several years, according to a recent University of California, Los Angeles survey.\n\nIt's a sad reality that Los Angeles is becoming more famous for its high cost of living than its beaches and year-round sunshine, but the study results speak volumes. L.A. has one of America's largest homeless populations and many residents fear they could be next.\n\nLos Angeles used to be a city where young people went to \"make it big\" in their chosen profession. Increasingly, it is becoming a city where anyone earning less than a six-figure income will be hard-pressed to make ends meet. The survey, conducted by the Luskin School of Public Affairs as part of its 2024 Quality of Life Index, reveals some troubling truths about where Angelenos see themselves and their futures.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Want To Grow Your Wealth Passively? Unlock Real Wealth with Cityfunds\u2019 Exclusive 8% Yield Fund.\n\nThe study results are clear: Los Angeles's high cost of living is hurting the quality of life for its residents, many of whom fear they can't keep up. Less than 25% of renters surveyed believed they would be able to purchase a home in an L.A. neighborhood where they wanted to live. It's not difficult to identify with their fears, especially considering that the average Los Angeles home costs nearly $1 million.\n\nBear in mind that $1 million is the average price. That means homes in Los Angeles's traditionally challenged neighborhoods sell in the mid to high six-figure range. By contrast, Zillow reports the average home in Beverly Hills is roughly $3 million \u2014 a nearly 200% increase over the average Beverly Hills home price in 2000 of around $1,000,000, according to the Southern California Association of Governments.\n\nOne significant kick-on effect of high home prices is that they leave Los Angeles apartment owners with a captive rental audience. Apartments in Los Angeles were temporary housing 20 to 30 years ago. Many area renters eventually became homebuyers because they didn't have to be movie stars or tech company executives to afford homes in desirable areas.\n\nTrending:\n\nWant to Create a Passive Income Stream? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail\n\nMiddle-class professionals like teachers and firemen were priced out of Beverly Hills in 2000, but they had options in areas like the San Fernando Valley or L.A.'s outlying suburbs. Now, they are permanently priced out of the Los Angeles County housing market, making them permanent renters. Unfortunately for them, rents are on the same upward trajectory as home prices. Zillow reports the average rent in Los Angeles is roughly $2,700 per month.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe standard qualification ratio for an apartment rent or mortgage payment is three times the monthly obligation. If the average rent is $2,700, a renter needs to make around $8,500 per month (over $100,000 annually) to qualify. Even in a city like Los Angeles where the cost of living was relatively high, crossing the $100,000 annual salary mark used to be where most people could stop living paycheck to paycheck and begin saving for retirement.\n\nNow, $100,000 barely gets Angelenos through the front door, and most Los Angeles renters don't make anywhere close to that. It explains why 4 out of 10 Los Angeles County residents fear eviction and are pessimistic about their futures in the area. This level of angst and apprehension about living in Los Angeles is a relatively new phenomenon.\n\nIt's also a factor investors should consider before buying property in the L.A. area. Historically, they have been able to rely on steady returns from rent increases. However, as renters' dissatisfaction with life in Los Angeles increases, along with their fear of becoming homeless, it's only a matter of time before L.A. rents hit a glass ceiling. They may be bumping up against it already.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDara Khosrowshahi-Backed Startup Lets You Become a Landlord with $100.

        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Zillow Group (ZG). This company, which is in the Zacks Internet - Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this online real estate marketplace has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 61.90%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Zillow was expected to post earnings of $0.12 per share, but it reported $0.20 per share instead, representing a surprise of 66.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.21 per share, while it actually produced $0.33 per share, a surprise of 57.14%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Zillow lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nZillow has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 1, 2024.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's what to expect.\n\nZillow beat analysts' revenue expectations by 5% last quarter, reporting revenues of $474 million, up 9% year on year. It was a solid quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Zillow a buy or sell going into earnings?

Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.38 per share. Zillow Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Zillow has a history of exceeding Wall Street's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 8% on average.\n\nLooking at Zillow's peers in the consumer discretionary segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Anywhere Real Estate posted flat year-on-year revenue, missing analysts' expectations by 1.8%, and Cushman & Wakefield reported a revenue decline of 2.9%, in line with consensus estimates. Anywhere Real Estate traded down 4.6% following the results, while\u00a0Cushman & Wakefield traded flat.\n\nRead our full analysis of Anywhere Real Estate's results here and Cushman & Wakefield's results here.\n\nValuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 thanks to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the consumer discretionary stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 6.2% on average over the last month. Zillow is down 9.6% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $57.7 (compared to the current share price of $42.83).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Louisiana. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating a solo retirement in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Louisiana.\n\nThe Reality of a Solo Retirement\n\nTwo spaces on the bed, two chairs at the dinner table, two pairs of shoes by the door. Life, and consequently retirement, is often thought of as being best lived in pairs. What then happens to the 27% of US adults aged 60 and above who spend retirement alone? This figure, revealed by the Pew Research Center, is the highest in the world. Known as \u2018Solo Seniors\u2019, \u2018Elder Orphans\u2019, or \u2018Solo Agers\u2019, these people wade through all the troubles and turmoils of retirement alone.\n\nFirst things first - why do so many senior citizens in the US live alone? Well for one, Americans are having fewer children. In a publication by The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT), it was revealed that the US birth rate began to drop around the year 2007 - and experiences such as the Great Recession and the Pandemic may have deterred people from having children. The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) also relayed several other factors that have contributed to a declining birth rate, including women\u2019s growing propensity to work and pursue higher education, the burden of student loans, and America\u2019s high cost of living, including that of childcare.\n\nSecondly, Americans are living longer. In 1950, life expectancy in the US stood at 68.14 years. In 2024, this has grown to 79.25 years, reports the UnitedNations. By 2050, this number is expected to grow to 83.37 years. Although a positive sign, a longer life leaves more time for unexpected and unwanted happenings to take place - such as the death of a spouse or separation through divorce. This leaves the individual alone in retirement.\n\nHowever, while Americans may be living longer, they are not necessarily living healthier. Analysis by News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA)\u2019s Wall Street Journal revealed that the average American in 2021 was spending 83.6% of their life in good health. This is a 2.2% drop from 1950\u2019s measure of 85.8% of an individual\u2019s life spent while healthy. Not only does this News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) backed data reveal a problem with America\u2019s quality of life, but it also highlights an obstacle that Solo Agers could face.\n\nOne possible solution that Solo Seniors could turn to is assisted living, including options such as Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:BKD). One of the largest senior living companies in the US, Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:BKD) has seven locations in the state of Louisiana itself. However, the option of assisted living has its own issues, with the first being the cost associated with it.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Making Louisiana Your Retirement Home\n\nSpeaking of Louisiana, the state is a commendable retirement location. According to Senior Living, 34.6% of the state\u2019s population is in the 50 and above age category, putting it just under the US average of 35.3%. So, of those who do retire in Louisiana, how do they fare?\n\nWell, the median price for a one-bedroom rental in Louisiana is $1,100, according to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z). This is 31% lower than the US median of $1,600 - a favorable factor for retirees living on smaller budgets, such as a Social Security income. Similarly, RentCafe states that food cost in the state is 5% lower than the national average. As for taxation policies, Louisiana is among the states that won\u2019t tax Social Security income in 2024. All of this combines to make the state financially friendly towards retirees, particularly those who are retiring with little to no savings. All in all, Louisiana is a good state to live in and a contender for interstate retirement relocations.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Louisiana state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Louisiana. 15 Best Places to Retire in Louisiana\n\nGoodluz/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Louisiana, we consulted several sources including our lists of 15 Best Places in Louisiana for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security, 18 Best Southern Cities to Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a Month, 15 Affordable Hidden Gem Southern Cities to Retire In, 25 Most Affordable Places to Retire in the U.S. in 2024, 29 US Cities Where You Can Retire on $2000 a Month, NewHomeSource, Niche, Unbiased, U.S. News & World Report, Movoto, and WorldAtlas, to name a few.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled, we ranked them across multiple factors, namely, cost of living, livability scores, and median house price. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard, we removed places with a livability score of below 65. A cumulative score was then assigned - livability scores were given a double weightage - with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Louisiana. For places that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places to retire in Louisiana:\n\n15. Bossier City\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 68\n\nLivability: 70\n\nCost of Living Index: 89\n\nMedian House Price: $233,000\n\nStarting off our list of the best places to retire in Louisiana is Bossier City. With a cost of living that is 11% below the national average, Bossier is a larger city that remains affordable - perfect for retirees who want to experience city retirement without breaking the bank. Residents can shop at the Louisiana Boardwalk Outlets, test their luck at the Louisiana Downs Casino, and grab a bite at Ralph & Kacoo\u2019s.\n\n14. Ruston\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 69\n\nLivability: 65\n\nCost of Living Index: 79.9\n\nMedian House Price: $230,000\n\nNext up is one of the best places to live in Louisiana, the city of Ruston. A small city, Ruston held a population of just under 22,300 at the time of the last United States Census. Not only does this make it the perfect blend of city life and a peaceful retirement, but senior citizens will also not have to venture far to access amenities. With medical centers, shopping centers, grocery options, and a post office, Ruston residents will have everything at hand.\n\n13. New Orleans\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 70\n\nLivability: 75\n\nCost of Living Index: 107.2\n\nMedian House Price: $320,000\n\nOne of our more expensive picks, New Orleans offers residents full bang for their buck. The city is located by the Mississippi River, affording residents with stunning water views. Famously known as \u2018Big Easy\u2019, New Orleans is best known for its never-ending nightlife, delicious cuisine, and exciting music scene.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 most promising stocks to buy before they take off. To skip the detailed analysis of the current earnings week, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off.\n\nMeta Grows Revenue by 27% in Q1, Provides Weak Outlook for FY '24\n\nThe market started the week on a positive note, showing an upward trajectory on April 22 and 23. However, there was a slight temporary dip in the market, especially for tech stocks after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) provided a disappointing outlook despite better-than-expected earnings. On April 24, the company reported Q1 2024 GAAP EPS of $4.71, ahead of consensus estimates by $0.39, and the revenue of $36.46 billion was up over 27% year-over-year and outperformed the forecasts by $240 million.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) provided weak outlook, showing increased expenses for the year and revenue expectations for the second quarter below analyst estimates. The company anticipates full-year 2024 capital expenditures to be between $35-40 billion, up from the prior guidance of $30-37 billion, and expects revenue of $36.5-39 billion in the second quarter. In addition, Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) metaverse division, Reality Labs continues to lose cash and reported losses of $3.85 billion on a $440 million revenue.\n\nNevertheless, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) mentioned some positives too about its AI offerings at its latest earnings call. The CEO, Mark Zuckerberg said:\n\n\u201cWe're building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs, and a lot more.\n\nLast week we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3. And our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service both in quality and usage.\n\nThe initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and, when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them, wherever they are.\u201d\n\nPerformance Spotlight: Cyclical Stocks Excel\n\nAs we mentioned in our earlier article, the performance of cyclical stocks is directly proportional to the market conditions (check out undervalued cyclical stocks). The recent performance of stocks such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) might show some optimism around the market. On April 24, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.53, outperforming the consensus estimates by $0.11 and revenues showed an increase of 12.2% at $2.57 billion, beating the forecasts by $40 million. The company also gave its outlook for the second quarter of 2024 and the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q2 2024, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) expects system-wide comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) to increase by 2% to 4% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, the system-wide comparable RevPAR is also set to increase by 2% to 4%, and net income is expected to be between $1.586 billion and $1.621 billion. Furthermore, the company expects adjusted EBITDA of $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion, up from its previous record of $3.1 billion in 2023. Finally, the company\u2019s capital returns are expected to be $3 billion. At its latest earnings call, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:HLT) CEO, Chris Nassetta made the following comments:\n\n\u201cIn the quarter, we signed 30,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to a record 472,000 rooms, up 2% from last quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Signings meaningfully outperformed our expectations driven by strength in international markets. In Asia-Pacific, we signed agreements for 4 new Conrad properties, further strengthening our luxury pipeline. Globally, an interest in Hilton Garden Inn remained particularly strong with the brand achieving the highest quarter of signings in its history.\n\nSystem-wide construction starts also outperformed expectations, up roughly 45% versus last year, with all major regions meaningfully higher. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly 4x our share of existing supply.\u201d\n\nFord Adapts: Mitigating EV Losses\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) outperformed earnings estimates and provided a strong outlook for the rest of the year. On April 24, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) reported a non-GAAP EPS of $0.49 vs $0.42 estimates, and revenues of $42.78 billion were up 3.2% year-over-year, outperforming market estimates by $1.31 billion. The company\u2019s EBIT outlook remained the same and is expected at the high end of the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) raised its adjusted free cash flow (FCF) outlook to the range of $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion from the prior guidance range of $6 billion and $7 billion. On top of that, the company decreased its capital expenditures outlook from $8 billion to $9.5 billion to a lower range of $8 billion to $9 billion. Ford Motor Company\u2019s (NYSE:F) president and CEO, Jim Farley made the following comments during the latest earnings call:\n\n\u201cI wanted to highlight four key strategic areas: how our growth drivers are changing, our progress in quality, the resilient Ford Pro business, and what we're learning on the electrification journey in Quarter 1. On growth, the portfolio changes we made and the restructuring we've done in our geographic footprint has really paid off for Ford. Several years ago, we normally would be reducing our volume and our mix and having good news on pricing.\n\nWhat's changed in the last year and especially in Q1, you could see, is our top-line and bottom-line profitability are increasing, driven by improved volumes and mix, and we're actually seeing pricing headwinds. And that new portfolio and geographic footprint is really tremendous to see at Ford. There is no better example for this than the portfolio changes we've made in our truck and van business. Ford is the No.\n\n1 best-selling pickup manufacturer in the world. And our Ford Transit cargo van is the best-selling in the world. It's now our second best-selling nameplate at Ford. And our midsized Ranger, not our most affordable pickup, is the third best-selling vehicle at Ford and together with the Everest makes up our profits outside of China, North America and Europe.\u201d\n\nSeeing the strong performance of cyclicals could be a sign of a strong economy ahead, and in such cases, investors could look toward stocks that have experienced a pullback and have significant upside to them. For people looking to invest in stocks that might be trading cheaply, the most promising stocks to buy before they take off include Li Auto Inc.

(NASDAQ:BIIB) during the quarter, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on multiple sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and most recently Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The company has been on a roller coast since the approval of Aduhelm, for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in June 2021. At the time, the approval was highly criticized given the limited efficacy of the treatment. Following the fallout, the company stands today with a new highly regarded CEO, Christopher Viehbacher, a more efficacious approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatment in Leqembi, a rationalized cost structure and a more disciplined investment approach. While the uptake in Leqembi has been slow, we still see strong long-term potential for a patient population that is dramatically underserved. We believe you are getting the opportunity to buy a high performing health care asset, with a strong track record of delivering superior products all while only paying for the current value of their assets on the market today. At the current valuation, we think you are getting a call option on the pipeline and the Leqembi roll-out. It is not often that you see this sort of risk/reward skew in the market, and we opportunistically took advantage.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Most Promising Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n25 Safest and Cheapest Cities To Retire in Florida 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Talking About 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "BIPOC renters hit hardest by high rent costs",
        "content": "New Zillow study sheds light on racial disparities in rent affordability as well as a nationwide shortfall in housing assistance\n\nBIPOC households in the U.S. typically spend 34% of their income on rent compared to 29% for the typical white renter household. Roughly 19 million\u00a0U.S. households qualify for housing choice vouchers based on their income, but only 2.4 million vouchers are available. Zillow recently launched a new listing feature that helps inform renters of their rights and how to report source-of-income discrimination.\n\nSEATTLE, April 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A new Zillow report uncovers deep-seated disparities in housing affordability across the country, particularly between BIPOC and white renter households. Although the magnitude of rent increases has slowed since the peak in 2022, nearly half of all renter households remain cost-burdened,1 with BIPOC households disproportionately affected.\n\nIn 2022, the typical BIPOC renter household in the U.S. spent 34% of their income on rent, while white households spent 29%. More alarming gaps appeared in several of the country's major metro areas, such as New Orleans, where BIPOC households spent 45% of their income on rent compared to 32% for white households. Notably, the median income of white renter households in New Orleans was 61% higher than that of BIPOC renter households. Although racial income gaps have narrowed over time, these figures underscore significant and persistent inequalities in housing affordability.\n\n\"Despite a recent slowdown in rent hikes, rent burdens remain critically high, particularly in BIPOC communities. These financial pressures not only make homeownership increasingly elusive but also contribute to a broader economic disparity,\" said Zillow senior economist Orphe Divounguy. \"Combined with a persistent housing deficit and lower incomes, people of color have fewer housing options, are less likely to own, and those who do own have lower home values. We need focused efforts to tackle these issues, as stable housing is key to improving health, education and economic opportunities.\"\n\nThe Largest Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Rent Burdens Among the Top 50 Metros\n\nMetro Area  Typical BIPOC Household Rent \r\nBurden (2022) Typical White Household Rent \r\nBurden (2022) New Orleans, LA 45\u00a0% 32\u00a0% Buffalo, NY 39\u00a0% 28\u00a0% Cincinnati, OH 37\u00a0% 27\u00a0% Pittsburgh, PA 36\u00a0% 26\u00a0% Cleveland, OH 36\u00a0% 28\u00a0% Birmingham, AL 40\u00a0% 31\u00a0% Atlanta, GA 36\u00a0% 29\u00a0% Memphis, TN 36\u00a0% 28\u00a0% Chicago, IL 35\u00a0% 28\u00a0% Boston, MA 41\u00a0% 34\u00a0%\n\nStory continues\n\nHousing assistance programs can't keep up with rent growth\n\nThe report also points to a critical shortage of housing assistance. During the pandemic, the rapid surge in market rents widened the gap between the number of households in need of assistance and the number of available housing choice vouchers (HCVs).\n\nIn 2022, roughly 19 million U.S. households qualified for HCVs based on their income, but only 2.4 million vouchers were available. In North Port, Florida \u2014 a metro between Tampa and Fort Myers \u2014 the number of households that could be eligible for vouchers surged by 43% between 2019 and 2022. Notably, metro areas in Florida represent half of the 10 metros with the most significant increases in households that could be eligible for HCVs.\n\nMetro Areas with the Largest Increase in Households with Incomes Eligible for Housing Choice Vouchers Between 2019 and 2022\n\nMetro Area  Households with \r\nIncomes 50% or Less of \r\nArea Median Income in \r\n2022 Total Renter \r\nHouseholds in 2022 Increase in Income-\r\nEligible Households \r\nSince 2019 North Port, FL 40,846 98,546 43\u00a0% Cape Coral, FL 32,813 88,220 37.5\u00a0% San Antonio, TX 272,544 484,724 32.6\u00a0% Orlando, FL 159,630 399,298 31.3\u00a0% Lakeland, FL 34,185 84,336 29\u00a0% Richmond, VA 106,333 213,951 26.3\u00a0% Palm Bay, FL 24,247 61,389 26.2\u00a0% Columbus, OH 219,266 423,454 24.8\u00a0% Albany, NY 77,394 134,986 19.6\u00a0% El Paso, TX 54,799 111,427 19.1\u00a0%\n\nHow vouchers work and how Zillow is getting involved\n\nHousing choice vouchers, also known as Section 8 vouchers, are designed to help low-income families by paying rent subsidies directly to landlords on behalf of the families. Families then pay the difference between the actual rent and the amount subsidized by the program, typically 30% of their income, up to a rent ceiling based on fair market rent estimates from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Since 2023, HUD has incorporated the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) into these estimates, making the voucher program more responsive to current market conditions.\n\nHowever, finding a suitable housing unit that accepts vouchers remains a challenge. Despite antidiscrimination laws in some regions, many landlords still do not accept vouchers, further complicating the search for affordable housing.\n\nTo inform renters and landlords about applicable source-of-income protections, every rental listing on Zillow includes information about local discrimination laws. This information appears under the \"Local Legal Protections\" tab on each listing.\n\nZillow has also recently introduced a tool to help inform renters of their rights and how to report source-of-income discrimination. The new data-powered resource arms rental voucher holders with information about local laws that protect them; it also offers tips on finding and renting homes that fit their criteria. The tool appears on those home listings on the Zillow website where source-of-income laws are applicable. Housing voucher tooltip\n\nZillow is committed to supporting fair housing practices through federal and state advocacy initiatives. One focus is advocating for legislation to safeguard sources of income, such as housing vouchers, from discriminatory practices in the housing market. By advocating for bills that protect against income-based discrimination, Zillow aims to ensure equal access to housing opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their financial circumstances.\n\nAbout Zillow Group Zillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we will be covering the 27 cheapest housing markets in the US. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Cheapest Housing Markets in the US.\n\nThe US Housing Market at a Glance\n\nHomeowners in the US continue to be victims of the mortgage lock-in effect where high rates stop them from selling their houses thereby reducing supply. Amidst the spring homebuying season in which the housing supply still remains restricted, an opportunity has been witnessed. As reported by CNBC on April 26, would-be homebuyers are seeing an opportunity in new construction. This is because these new homes tend to offer more incentives and are not limited as compared to existing homes.\n\nBuyers are also getting motivated to consider the new home sales market through incentives including rate buy-downs and price cuts. The month of March saw the sale of 693,000 new single-family houses thereby recording a year-over-year rise of 8.3%. At the same time, existing home sales went down by 3.7% year-over-year. In terms of price, the median price for a new home has been nearly 4% higher than that for an existing home. Although buyers who were price conscious used to take into account only the existing homes market, the market of new homes tends to offer them more options. You can also take a look at some of the best states for first-time homebuyers.\n\nRegional Analysis of the Homebuying Market\n\nAccording to a report by Zillow, home values have climbed in 47 of the 50 largest US metro areas. The highest annual price increases have been recorded at 12.7% for Hartford, 11.8% for San Diego, 11.2% for San Jose, 9.5% for Boston, and 9.3% for Los Angeles. Some of the least affordable metros for homebuyers in the US have been previously discussed. On the contrary, home values have dropped in New Orleans by 7.6%, in Austin by 4.1%, and in San Antonio by 1.9%. New construction in the South such as in Florida and Texas has been capable of catering to the buyer demand which has helped control the rapid price appreciation. Regarding this, you can view the most underpriced housing markets in the US in 2024.\n\nIn terms of housing supply, total inventory has grown annually in 36 of the 50 largest US markets. In this regard, the highest increases have been recorded for Tampa at 38%, Dallas at 37.8%, and Orlando at 33.2%. New listings have climbed in San Jose by 18.4%, in Dallas-Fort Worth by 16.6%, and in Tampa by 15.4%. Simultaneously, new listings have declined in Boston by 17.2%, in Pittsburgh by 14.2%, and in Washington D.C. by 13.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverview of the Rental Market\n\nAs compared to 2023, rents were reported to have increased by 3.6%. On a year-over-year basis, rents have increased in Providence by 8.2%, in Louisville by 6.9%, in Cleveland by 6.5%, in Hartford by 6.4%, and in Boston by 6.1%. As of March, asking rents have risen by 0.6% month-over-month. Pittsburgh is the only major US metro where rents have declined by 0.2% since February. The month of March recorded a 0.7% month-over-month rise in the typical rent for single-family homes. On the other hand, a modest growth rate of 0.5% was witnessed for multi-family rents.\n\nNew Communities in the US\n\nAmerican homebuyers can consider looking at offerings from reputable homebuilders such as LGI Homes, Inc.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Oregon. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Oregon.\n\nAn Oregon Retirement: Yay or Nay?\n\nAccording to a recent survey by ClearMatch Medicare, 45% of American seniors name travel as a retirement-time goal. In fact, an insight into US traveler demographics by Zippia reveals that this goal often becomes reality. The average age of a US traveler is 51 years old, and if we look at white US travelers specifically, then this age grows to 57 and 53 for men and women, respectively. Moreover, a whopping 84% of all US travelers are in the 40+ age category. So, why is America\u2019s older population so prone to traveling? And what are the drivers behind it?\n\nWell, for one, there is the freedom - and the demand for a distraction from the loneliness - of an empty nest. As individuals grow older, it is more likely that children have left the home to pursue their own lives, leaving their parents free to follow their paths. Secondly, older adults may have better finances, allowing them to spend on luxuries such as travel. Vice President of Sales for ClearMatch Medicare, Jennifer Girdler, also weighed in on the trend.\n\n\u201cMany retirees are eager to embark on a new chapter filled with their passions and interests. While there are concerns about the challenges that come with later life changes, it\u2019s inspiring to see that seniors are proactively addressing these issues by setting retirement goals.\u201d -Jennifer Girdler, Vice President of Sales, ClearMatch Medicare\n\nAmong the many purposes of American travel is the drive to find the ideal retirement destination - whether simply in a different state or a different country. Reverting back to ClearMatch Medicare\u2019s survey, results reveal that only about 41% of Americans in the 65 and above age group plan to stay put during retirement - the rest are open to relocation. Some of the most common reasons as to why American seniors relocate is in search of warmer weather and quieter, more peaceful locations.\n\nIf venturing abroad to some of the best expat retirement countries in the world seems like too far of a shot in the dark, then interstate moves can be just as rewarding - if not more. A search for favorable taxation policies, lower costs of living, and even moving closer to family are among the most common reasons why America\u2019s retiring class moves. Of course, with over 50 states on hand, landing on a retirement destination can prove to be a taxing challenge - but among the hidden gems lies the state of Oregon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with all places, retiring in Oregon has its pros and cons. To name one each, stunning meteor showers and troublesome brush fires. Statistically, there is favor on Oregon\u2019s side. SeniorLiving reports that about 37% of Oregon\u2019s population is in the 50 and above age group, and they tend to fare pretty well. For one, the state boasts an average life expectancy - 79.5 years - that is a full year above the US average. Senior citizens who choose to stay in the workforce also face favorable circumstances with them receiving a higher wage than the national average for the 65 and above population. Oregon also matches seniors\u2019 climate expectations with Eastern Oregon embracing a semi-arid climate and Western Oregon holding a warm-summer Mediterranean climate.\n\nIn terms of living expenses, Oregon\u2019s rental market is more advantageous than that of the US as a whole. According to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), Oregon\u2019s median figure for a one-bedroom rental lies at $1,400 - a whole 13% lower than the national median of $1,600.\u00a0 While even $1,400 is a sizeable figure to deduct from your monthly budget, retirees can search for more affordable options with Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) listing rentals as low as $338.\n\nFor senior citizens who are planning to make more permanent housing plans and purchase a property of their own, the Oregon market is more expensive than some other states. The median price for an Oregon house sits at $499,000, according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). However, Oregon\u2019s property tax rate of 0.82% is lower than the US average of 0.99%\n\nThe state is also welcoming to retirees living off of Social Security checks as Oregon is among the states that won\u2019t tax Social Security income in 2024, helping those already on a small budget to live a little easier.\n\nAll of this brings us back to the question of \u2018Is Oregon friendly for retirees - is it a yes or a no?\u2019 With the right planning, the right financial advice, and the right location, an Oregon retirement can prove to be extremely rewarding and a decision you won\u2019t regret.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Oregon state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Oregon. 15 Best Places to Retire in Oregon\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Oregon, we consulted several sources including our lists of 25 Best Cities where You can Retire on $4,000 a Month, 16 Best Cities for Retirees in the Pacific Northwest, 20 Best Kept Secret Places to Retire in USA, 20 Safest Places To Retire in the US, 20 Best US Cities to Retire with $1 Million in Retirement Savings, Niche, SmartAsset, NewHomeSource, Unbiased, and Planswell.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled, we ranked them across multiple factors, namely, cost of living, livability scores, and median house price. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard and not overly expensive, we removed places with a livability score below 60 and a cost of living index higher than 120. A cumulative score was then assigned - livability scores were given a double weightage - with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Oregon.\n\nFor places that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places to retire in Oregon:\n\n15. Prineville\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 65\n\nLivability: 71\n\nCost of Living Index: 100.1\n\nMedian House Price: $413,500\n\nStarting off our list of the best places to retire in Oregon is the Crook County city of Prineville. Known as the \u2018Rockhound Capital of the U.S.\u2019, Prineville gets the name due to the gemstones that are located in the area. The city holds a population of less than 11,500 - as per the last United States Census - offering retirees a break from the hustle and bustle of big cities. Prineville residents can spend their days at the Crook County Library, the Pine Movie Theater, and the Steins Pillar hiking trail.\n\n14. Bend\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 66\n\nLivability: 84\n\nCost of Living Index: 118.5\n\nMedian House Price: $734,900\n\nOur next pick is the riverside city of Bend. Located on the Deschutes River, the city is also near the Cascade Mountains which lie to its west and hold several trails and ski resorts. The city proves to be the perfect retirement spot for senior citizens who want to spend their retirement in nature, as Bend holds stunning views and plenty of access to the great outdoors. While the city\u2019s high cost of living might be a hit to some, Bend does provide more affordable living options.\n\n13.

        "content": "Though fair housing laws have been in place for nearly 60 years, a majority of people \u2014 particularly renters, young adults and people of color \u2014 report facing housing discrimination\n\nFifty-seven percent of all respondents in a recent Zillow survey reported experiencing housing discrimination of some kind. LGBTQ+ individuals were most likely to say they have experienced discrimination. However, fewer than half of respondents said fair housing is important to them or their families \u2014 highlighting how much work is needed to educate people about these laws.\n\nSEATTLE, April 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Most people say they have experienced housing discrimination, with younger generations, renters, LGBTQ+ people and people of color more likely to say fair housing is an issue facing them and their families, according to a recent Zillow survey of 26 major U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nAlthough fair housing laws \u2014 which ensure equal and nondiscriminatory access to housing \u2014 have been in place for nearly 60 years, discrimination remains a stubborn factor in housing, Zillow's latest Housing Aspirations Report shows. The survey found a majority of respondents (57%) reported experiencing some kind of housing discrimination, with groups such as LGBTQ+ populations reporting discrimination at higher rates. However, overall, only 42% of respondents reported that fair housing impacts them or their families, highlighting how much work is needed to continue to educate people about their rights under fair housing laws.\n\n\"April is Fair Housing Month, and this research shows how far we have to go to make housing fair and accessible for all,\" said Manny Garcia, senior population scientist at Zillow. \"Over half of respondents report experiencing housing discrimination. Fair housing issues are more likely to be top of mind for younger generations, likely attributable to their higher likelihood of moving, renting and buying a home more frequently than older generations, given their current stage of life.\"\n\nSeventy percent of respondents agreed that owning a home is necessary to achieve the American dream, and nearly 80% reported that owning a home is critical to building and passing on generational wealth. However, exclusionary housing policies and practices, plus a tight supply of housing and a variety of other factors, have prevented aspiring BIPOC homeowners from purchasing homes at the same rate as their white counterparts: While 74.5% of white households own their homes, only 46% of Black and 49% of Hispanic households own theirs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Zillow's research, one of the most significant obstacles preventing potential home buyers from accessing homeownership is saving for a down payment. Addressing the down payment barrier for first-time home buyers can help more people of color access the benefits homeownership offers and can help close the homeownership gaps between Black, Hispanic and white households. Across 26 major US metros, majority of people say they have experienced housing discrimination. Across 26 major US metros, majority of people say they have experienced housing discrimination. Across 26 major US metros, majority of people say they have experienced housing discrimination. Across 26 major US metros, majority of people say they have experienced housing discrimination.\n\nHow\u00a0Zillow is addressing fair housing issues Zillow includes information on down payment assistance resources on every for-sale listing on its site and app to help potential buyers connect to one of the more than 2,000 assistance programs available across the United States.\n\nLast year Zillow advocated for the passage of the Washington Covenant Homeownership Act. This new program will provide financial assistance to support homeownership for people impacted by housing discrimination in the state once excluded by racially restrictive covenants.\n\nThis year, Zillow announced that renters who pay their landlords through Zillow can now opt in to rent payment reporting to help build or enhance their credit history, with on-time payments reported to a major national credit bureau.\n\nA patchwork of cities and just 23 states offer explicit fair housing protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. To help LGBTQ+ people and their allies more easily identify which homes are in jurisdictions that offer protections, Zillow developed an LGBTQ+ Local Legal Protections tool, which adds information on LGBTQ+ housing, employment and public accommodation laws to all Zillow home listings across the nation.\n\nZillow works year-round to help bring about meaningful change in the U.S. real estate industry; make home a reality for more people; and to educate consumers about the history of housing discrimination and the legacy it leaves.\n\nMethodology In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of adults ages 18 and older, Zillow Group Population Science conducted a representative survey of more than 12,000 adults across 26 metros. The survey was fielded in March and April 2024.\n\nSampling & weighting Results from this survey are representative of adults in each metropolitan area. To achieve representativeness, ZG Population Science used a two-pronged approach. First, the initial recruitment to the sample was balanced to all adults from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) on the basis of age, relationship status, income, ethnicity/race, education and sex. Additional targeted subgroups were sampled based on all key household demographic characteristics. Second, statistical raking was used to create calibration weights to ensure that the distribution of survey respondents matched each metro's population with respect to a number of key demographic characteristics.\n\nAbout Zillow Group Zillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 25 safest and cheapest cities to retire in Florida. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Safest and Cheapest Cities To Retire in Florida.\n\nDoes the Sunshine State Still Hold Retirement Charm?\n\nMoving for retirement is nothing new in America\u2019s retirement landscape. Senior citizens have been doing it for years, and in fact, the trend has been on the rise. Hire A Helper\u2019s latest migration trends report revealed that in excess of 338,000 American retirees shifted for retirement in 2023, with the number being a 44% rise from the previous year.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to deduce the motivation behind this trend. After all, most retirees are not financially wealthy, and moving to a place with a lower cost of living makes sense in the larger retirement plan. While why retirees are moving is obvious enough, where they are moving is a whole other chapter. America\u2019s Sunshine State has long since been a retirement favorite. Subtropical climate, beaches, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and sprawling golf courses are just some of what attract thousands of retirees from across the country - but is the charm still there?\n\nFor one, Florida is getting more expensive. Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) reports a 3.9% price increase in the Florida housing market since last year, with the median house now priced at $400,000. Florida\u2019s rental market is also unfavorable for retirees with the average Florida rent sitting at a sizeable $2,500 a month - 22% higher than the national median, reports Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z). Looking at these figures, some experts have predicted a move away from the Sunshine State.\n\n\u201cMy guess is it\u2019s probably due to cost. More folks are looking for someplace that\u2019s also warm but maybe isn\u2019t as expensive.\u201d -Miranda Marquit, Consumer Advocate and Spokesperson, Hire A Helper.\n\nHowever, migration trends report differently. Hire A Helper\u2019s 2023 Migration Trends report pits Florida as the top state for incoming retirees with the state accounting for over 11% of all retirement moves. In fact, Florida hosts one of the largest retirement populations in the country with 21.6% of all Florida residents belonging to the 65 and above age group - as per the United States Census Bureau\u2019s population numbers.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that retirement - and catering to the hoards of incoming retirees - is ingrained in the Florida DNA. While some may look at the state\u2019s apparent rising cost and take a step backward, considering there are many cities that are getting too expensive for retirees, an affordable retirement is possible in the state - all you need to do is to know where to look. Florida is also among the states that won\u2019t tax Social Security income in 2024, earning it a \u2018very tax-friendly\u2019 ranking. Similarly, the state also carries many cities that have a lower cost of living with several rentals on Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) below the $1,000 mark.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re moving for the weather, for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), or the beaches, Florida can still provide a fulfilling retirement - just put in your work and do your research beforehand.\n\nTo facilitate present and future retirees contemplating a retirement move to the Sunshine State, we have compiled the following list of the safest and cheapest cities to retire in Florida. 25 Safest and Cheapest Cities To Retire in Florida\n\nRob Hainer/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 25 safest and cheapest cities to retire in Florida, we turned to our range of articles on best places to retire in Florida, such as 20 Best Places to Retire in Florida, 13 Best Places in Florida to Retire on a Budget, 51 Best Cities to Retire on $3,500 a Month, 15 Best Places to Retire in Florida Without Hurricanes, and 20 Best Small Towns in Florida to Retire. Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them using unique Insider Monkey safety and cost of living indexes. Our safety index accounts for multiple factors, including home safety, community safety, healthcare, alcohol and cigarette use, fitness, air quality, and water quality. Our cost of living index covers housing, utilities, food, transport, taxes, and healthcare.\n\nFor our Insider Monkey cost of living index, a score of 100 represents the national US average for cost of living, therefore, a score of 98 would indicate a cost of living that is 2% below the US average. As for our Insider Monkey safety score, the scores above 60 represent an above average safety score. A cumulative score was then assigned to each city, with the 25 highest-scoring cities making our list of the 25 safest and cheapest cities to retire in Florida. For cities that gained an equal score, their cost of living indexes were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last. It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "In this article, we will be covering the 20 affordable, promising cities to buy real estate in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Affordable, Promising Cities to Buy Real Estate in 2024.\n\nUS Real Estate Affordability: A Brief Recap\n\nThe US housing market has long been subjected to a serious housing crisis. On October 20, 2023, CNN reported that home sales hit a 13-year low in September 2023. A large proportion of would-be buyers were unable to attain a home due to soaring interest rates in addition to highly-priced houses. The monthly payment on an average-priced home required 40% of the median household income which resulted in affordability concerns.\n\nCurrent Affordability Patterns and Home Price Dynamics\n\nThe New York Times has reported the aforementioned affordability crisis to persist. Home prices in the United States have climbed more than 60% in the preceding 10 years. Simultaneously, a quarter of renters in the United States tend to spend more than half of their income on housing.\n\nOn the other hand, the mortgage situation remains adverse. While mortgage rates fell through mid-January to the mid-6% range, they have started to climb again. On April 18, CNBC reported that the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage exceeded 7% on April 1, the highest since mid-November of 2023. Mortgage rates have been predicted to remain elevated and hence, homebuyers and owners who have been waiting for lower mortgage rates might be hanging in there for a longer period.\n\nOn April 15, Zillow reported that home values are climbing at a rapid month-over-month rate in the major and most expensive US metros. Prices have gone up by 3.3% in San Jose, 2.7% in San Francisco, 2.4% in Seattle, 2.1% in San Diego and 2.0% in Los Angeles. However, the price appreciation, in this case, becomes a dilemma for many since would-be homebuyers cannot pursue these markets due to overall high prices while existing homeowners continue to be locked into their mortgages as it is extremely costly for them to buy a home at current rates. Another issue with these markets is that the inventory has not yet grown since the pandemic\u2019s outbreak which has driven more competition for few choices. You can also take a look at the cities with the highest home price increases since the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, home price appreciation has toned down in the South where inventory has recovered since the pandemic. This has resulted in less competition and has controlled extremely high prices. On a monthly basis, metros including New Orleans, San Antonio, Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville experienced the slowest but still fairly solid price growths. New Orleans and Austin have seen a rise in the new listings of existing homes as compared to the pre-pandemic period.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop Homebuilders in the US\n\nAmericans can look for reputable homebuilders such as M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:MDC), Century Communities, Inc. (NYSE:CCS), and LGI Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:LGIH) to settle in some of the most convenient and desirable locations across the country. Additionally, they can view some of the best states for first-time homebuyers.\n\nM.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:MDC) operates Richmond American Homes which is one of the largest US homebuilders. The homebuilder has operations in multiple states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. On April 18, the company\u2019s subsidiary Richmond American Homes of Arizona, Inc. announced its new community in Tucson. The new community \u2018Seasons at Blackhawk\u2019 is located near downtown Tucson. Parks, playgrounds, and trails will be offered as amenities to residents. Tucson International Airport and Davis Monthan Air Force Base can also be accessed.\n\nCentury Communities, Inc. (NYSE:CCS) is a major American homebuilder that is engaged in the construction, innovative marketing, and sale of homes for diverse buyers. On April 17, the company announced that it has initiated sales of single-family homes at its new Seattle-area community \u2018Lakeview Terrace\u2019. Those who wish to live in the community can easily travel to downtown Seattle, Renton's city center, Boeing Renton Factory, and Newcastle Beach Park. A playground, walking trails, and views of Lake Washington are some of the amenities that can be enjoyed.\n\nLGI Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:LGIH) engages in the design, construction, and sale of homes across 36 markets in 21 states. On April 16, the homebuilder reported that it opened its first community in the St. Cloud market. While the new community \u2018Parkside\u2019 is only 15 minutes away from downtown St. Cloud., it also offers easy access to Minneapolis. Homes in the community have been priced from the $370,000s.\n\nOther than M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:MDC), Century Communities, Inc. (NYSE:CCS), and LGI Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:LGIH), some of the largest builders in the US have been previously covered.

        "title": "High mortgage rates are finally hitting new home construction as builders are pulling back on projects",
        "content": "The housing crisis in America is multifaceted. Prospective home buyers are reluctant to buy, given sky-high mortgage rates and home prices\u2014and for the same reason, current homeowners have shied away from selling. But there\u2019s also a massive housing crunch; the U.S. is short 3 million to 6 million homes.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, there\u2019s been a slowdown in both single-family and multifamily housing construction, according to U.S. Census Bureau data issued Tuesday. Indeed, single-family starts fell in March because \u201cbuilders are beginning to anticipate that mortgage rates will likely remain elevated for much longer than previously thought,\u201d according to Zillow. As of Wednesday, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was at a five-month high of 7.43%. This is the biggest one-month drop in new home construction since April 2021, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nBuilders\u2019 hands are tied\n\nA number of factors have contributed to slowing new construction numbers, industry experts agree. And it doesn\u2019t all have to do with consumers\u2014there are several market factors that have forced builders to pump the brakes on new builds.\n\n\u201cWhile we are experiencing a housing supply shortage, the fact is that with high mortgage rates and an uncertain job market, many that want to purchase homes simply can't do so,\u201d Ryan Hoover, CEO of Ceed Civil Engineering, which specializes in new-home construction, tells Fortune. \u201cSo from a builder's perspective, it makes little economic sense to ramp up construction on homes that won't be sold in the near future.\u201d What\u2019s more, materials costs are rising again, and the lumber tax is expected to go up this summer, he says.\n\nIt\u2019s also more difficult for builders to find more affordable financing options for new builds, Kori Sassower, a team head and real estate agent with Compass who focuses on new construction, tells Fortune. And there\u2019s less land available to buy for new construction than in recent years, which is prompting more builders to buy and tear down existing homes, she adds.\n\n\u201cUltimately, builders aren\u2019t holding back because they don\u2019t believe the demand is there,\u201d Sassower says. \u201cThe issue is that they don\u2019t have enough supply and financing is making building prohibitive.\u201d\n\nA closer look at the numbers\n\nSingle-family housing starts are slowing, but they\u2019re still 21.2% higher than last year\u2019s pace, according to Zillow. Multifamily builds are faring worse: Construction on buildings with at least five units decreased by 20.7% in March and 43.7% from the previous year, Zillow\u2019s analysis shows.\n\nStory continues\n\nFalling construction numbers will have both long- and short-term effects on the housing market. In the immediate term, lower construction numbers mean lower inventory levels\u2014preventing the drop in home prices that buyers are clamoring for. Since the start of the pandemic, home prices have skyrocketed, which makes it exceedingly difficult for new buyers to break into the market. Indeed, the stock of existing homes available for sale remains 36% below pre-pandemic levels, and home values increased faster this month when compared to March 2023, according to Zillow.\n\nSlowing construction will also impact local labor markets as fewer projects get started, Ryan Reich, real estate developer and chief investment officer of Mountain Shore Properties, tells Fortune. In other words, fewer new projects mean fewer construction jobs.\n\n\u201cLonger-term, when demand finally does pick up\u2014from lower interest rates or the slow rollover of existing mortgages to higher-rated mortgages\u2014it will put upward pressure on prices as it takes several years for housing supply to come online to meet demand,\u201d Reich says.\n\nTo combat high mortgage rates and home prices, builders have sweetened incentives to entice prospective buyers to actually make a move.\n\n\u201c\u2018Incentive\u2019 is just a big fancy word for discount, and what we\u2019re seeing on that front is that it\u2019s what\u2019s creating a competitive advantage for the new-home market,\u201d Devyn Bachman, senior vice president of research with John Burns Research and Consulting, previously told Fortune. The mortgage-rate buydown, the industry term for discounted mortgage rates, is the most \u201cdesired and most effective\u201d incentive offered in the new-home market today, she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, 22% of builders cut their prices this month, according to Zillow, further sweetening the pot for buyers. The average price cut is 6%. But for some buyers, that\u2019s still not enough.\n\n\u201cLong-term, there will be a shift to alternative housing solutions,\u201d Hoover says. One thing his firm has seen is an increase in requests to design shipping container homes, \u201cwhich indicates to me that buyers are looking for alternatives to the traditional housing market.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Home prices skyrocketed 40% during the pandemic\u2014but Zillow sees them rising less than 2% this year",
        "content": "In roughly two years during the pandemic housing boom, home prices rose more than 40%. Since then, home prices continued their upward ascent. Capital Economics, for its part, recently said that the national average house price has risen almost 50% since the start of the pandemic. First American yesterday released its home price index report that found \u201chouse prices nationally are now 52% higher compared to pre-pandemic levels,\u201d having increased more than 6% in the past year.\n\nBut maybe things are set to change. Zillowrecently revised its home price forecast upward, but it only sees home values rising 1.9% this year; previously, it expected home prices to increase by 0.9%. Zillow called it \u201cslower than long-term norms but a welcome slowdown for first-time buyers compared to the rapid appreciation seen over the pandemic,\u201d in a report published earlier this week. Still, before the pandemic, it was normal for home prices to appreciate around either 5% or 6% each year, Redfin\u2019s chief economist, Daryl Fairweather, recently noted.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Zillow\u2019s changed its home price forecast for the year, and probably won\u2019t be the last. But its reasoning has to do with new for-sale listings and mortgage rates.\n\n\u201cWith interest rates still elevated, the modest upward revision is mostly the result of a slowdown in the growth of new for-sale listings,\u201d Zillow said. \u201cAfter rising at an annual pace of 21% in February, the year-over-year increase in new listings eased in March to just 4%, indicating that the market remains quite tight for would-be homebuyers.\u201d\n\nYesterday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell basically said interest rate cuts might not happen this year. \u201cRight now, given the strength of the labor market and progress on inflation so far, it\u2019s appropriate to allow restrictive policy further time to work,\u201d he said, later adding that depending on inflation, the Fed will maintain the current interest rate levels for as long as needed.\n\nThat\u2019s not good news for mortgage rates, or really anyone who wants to buy a home. In October last year, mortgage rates reached a more than two-decade high at 8.03%. For some time, they were falling, at one point dipping to 6.61%. But in the past week or so, mortgage rates have been on the rise; the latest reading showed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 7.50%, the highest all year.\n\n\u201cPersistent inflation has diminished any optimism that the Federal Reserve may start to cut rates in June, meaning mortgage rates seem more and more likely to remain \u2018higher for longer\u2019 this year,\u201d First American\u2019s chief economist, Mark Fleming, said in an analysis accompanying its home price index.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo one knows what will happen with mortgage rates or new listings, but we know the lock-in effect is real: So as long as mortgage rates are higher than what people are used to, homeowners will choose not to sell. \u201cMany sellers will remain on strike keeping a lid on supply,\u201d Fleming said.\n\nFor its part, Zillow said, \u201cIt remains to be seen how new listings will fare in April\u2014the Easter holiday falling in March and the fact that February was a leap year are likely clouding the broader picture.\u201d Nevertheless, last year, existing home sales fell to their lowest point in almost 30 years; and Zillow seems to expect them to fall further this year.\n\n\u201cZillow\u2019s forecast now calls for 4.06 million existing home sales in 2024, slightly below both 2023\u2019s level of 4.09 million and the previous forecast of 4.1 million existing home sales this year,\u201d it said, despite February\u2019s \u201cbetter than expected sales.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Georgia. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Georgia.\n\nNavigating an American Retirement\n\nHitting your mid-60s, hanging up your work tie, and spending the rest of your days on the golf course - this is what the stereotypical American retirement has been painted to be. In reality, America\u2019s retirement landscape is evolving and a greater number of US citizens are staying in the workforce well beyond their 60s.\n\nA 2023 study by the Pew Research Center found that America\u2019s current older workforce consists of about 11 million workers - a number that has quadrupled since the 1980s. Even in terms of percentage, the number of older Americans working today is much greater today than in the 1980s - 2023 saw 19% of all older Americans working, compared to a mere 11% in 1987.\n\nThis is not a temporary trend either. Research by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that the presence of older Americans in the workforce will grow over the next decade. The research suggests that by 2032, 8.6% of the US workforce will consist of workers over the age of 65, a 2% increase from 2022 numbers. All this has had an impact on the average US retirement age which Gallup says has risen to 62 from the 59 figure associated with the early 2000s.\n\nThe obvious question follows - why are Americans working more years? The answer is a mix of both want and need.\n\n\u201cYou can think of it as both a reflection of empowered preferences to go work more and longer \u2014 versus curtailed savings that force you into the labor force. They\u2019re both happening.\u201d\n\n-Kathryn Edwards, Economist\n\nRecent years have seen a noticeable change in retirement income sources. Gallup shares that about 59% of retirees account for Social Security as a major source of their retirement income. Other sources - such as home equity and insurance plans - are seeing record lows with the former being utilized by only 15% of retirees. All in all, Americans are pessimistic about their approaching retirement, with sentiments being the worst they have been since 2012 Gallup reports.\n\nUnsurprisingly, American expectations for a comfortable retirement generally don\u2019t align with their realities. A survey conducted by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) revealed that Americans estimate needing $1.8 million for a comfortable retirement - eons away from the 59% of retirees who attribute a large part of their income to Social Security checks. Recently, several financial tools and services have entered the market, aiming to help Americans better manage their retirement savings. These include the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s Financial Wellness Tracker and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW)\u2019s Retirement Income Calculator. While useful, tools are only an assistive measure and cannot replace the financial realities that plague today\u2019s average American citizen.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if retirees are not looking to match the Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey number, many senior citizens work longer to get full advantage of retirement benefits. For those born after 1960, US retirement benefits are only fully realized at the age of 67, a motivating factor for many individuals to keep working past their early 60s.\n\nAs such, when retirement does finally roll around, the emphasis is on making the best of it. For some, this means finding the best places to retire around the world, and for others, it means simply partaking in interstate travel to find your best American retirement destinations. An increasingly popular retirement state is turning out to be Georgia. Subtropical climate, lower costs of living, and Southern hospitality are just some of the factors that draw retirees.\n\nTo facilitate retirees who are pondering the move to Georgia, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Georgia. 15 Best Places to Retire in Georgia\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Georgia, we consulted several sources including our own lists, as well as external sources such asThe Tech Advocate,Movoto,Niche,Travel+Leisure, and New Home Source. Once a list of places was compiled, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their livability score, their average monthly charge for a one-bedroom rental, and their average grocery bill for an individual. For this article, livability scores were taken from AreaVibes, rent figures were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) and Zumper, and grocery prices were taken from the Economic Policy Institute (where specific town or city grocery prices were unavailable, county prices were applied). To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard, we removed any places with a livability score of below 60. Places without one-bedroom rental listings were also removed. A cumulative score was then assigned to each place, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Georgia. For places that gained an equal score, their grocery figures were used as a tie-breaker. Our list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "These Two Data Points Illustrate The Reality That America Has Two Housing Markets",
        "content": "These Two Data Points Illustrate The Reality That America Has Two Housing Markets\n\nA recent report from Zillow indicates that America has 550 cities with median home prices of $1 million. Yet none of those cities are on the list of Zillow's top ten hottest housing markets of 2024. That disparity paints a picture of the extent to which America has a dual-track housing market.\n\nOn one track are Americans who can afford homes in the $1-million zip codes or are locked into those zip codes on low-interest-rate mortgages. On the other track are Americans who were marginally priced out of the housing market before the pandemic and now find themselves left even further adrift by high interest rates and low availability of affordable homes. The U.S. is becoming a nation of winners and losers when it comes to real estate ownership.\n\nCities with average home values over $1 million are not new. The reality is that most American homebuyers never expected to live in places like Malibu, California, or Darien, Connecticut. They also never expected that buying in the relatively middle- to upper-middle-class enclaves that symbolize the American dream would come with a seven-figure price tag.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Want To Grow Your Wealth Passively? Unlock Real Wealth with Cityfunds\u2019 Exclusive 8% Yield Fund.\n\nCalifornia leads the list, with 210 cities having million-dollar home values. Most of those cities are in metropolitan areas around Los Angeles or San Francisco, although San Diego and San Jose's metro areas are also represented. On the East Coast, the metropolitan areas of New York and Boston account for the lion's share of the million-dollar markets with Washington, D.C. and Miami, Florida making appearances.\n\nThe irony is that many of the cities that find themselves on the million-dollar list and the metropolitan areas they surround were once cities Americans migrated to so they could make it big. They are becoming cities where Americans move if only if they've already made it. A million-dollar home price is double the cost of the median home in the United States.\n\nTrending\n\nWant to Create a Passive Income Stream? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail\n\nAmericans are responding by moving to cities with lower costs of living and more affordable homes. America's Sunbelt, which stretches from Florida to Arizona and north to the Carolinas, has been experiencing unprecedented population growth. Zillow's top 10 list of America's hottest real estate markets for 2024 shows that even cold-weather markets like Cleveland, Ohio, and Buffalo, New York, have become destination cities for Americans searching for affordable housing opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also worth noting that most of the cities on Zillow's top 10 hottest housing markets list have a median home price that is close to or lower than the national average. Contrast that with the fact that none of the 550 million-dollar cities made the top 10 list, and it's hard to ignore the reality that America's housing market is almost completely bifurcated.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

        "content": "Listing Showcase is an immersive, AI-powered listing experience available only on Zillow\n\nSEATTLE, April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Screen appeal is the new curb appeal, and homes with Listing Showcase \u2014 immersive, AI-powered listings available only on Zillow\u00ae \u2014 capture more views, sell for higher prices and sell faster than similar homes on Zillow with traditional online listings. Screen appeal is the new curb appeal, and homes with Listing Showcase \u2014 featuring immersive, AI-powered listings available only on Zillow\u00ae \u2014 capture more views, sell for higher prices and sell faster than similar homes on Zillow with traditional online listings.\n\nNew Zillow data shows that Showcase listings are 20% more likely to secure an accepted offer within 14 days compared to similar typical listings on Zillow.1 Homes listed with Showcase also sell for 2% more, a bonus of more than $9,000 on the average home.1\n\n\"The introduction of Showcase listings on Zillow has been a game changer for sellers \u2014 it represents the future of property listings\u00a0on the most visited real estate website in the U.S.,\" said Zillow Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Wacksman. \"And it's quite clear Showcase listings both attract shoppers and help sellers net a higher asking price. In today's spring shopping season, well-marketed and well-priced homes move quickly, and Showcase is helping to do just that.\"\n\nAs the selling season gets into full swing, it's important for a home listing to stand out. According to Zillow's most recent market report, there were 12.2% more listings active in March, compared to last year. Well-marketed and competitively priced listings are going quickly, while others linger, with the median age for all listings on Zillow standing at 43 days.\n\nListings on Zillow serve as the initial impression of a house for many prospective buyers, and making a property stand out is key for a seller. Showcase listings earn 75% more page views, 68% more saves and 75% more shares compared to similar nearby traditional listings on Zillow.1 By working with a Showcase agent, sellers will have their homes appear higher in home shoppers' personalized search results, which is where the majority of shoppers begin their search.\n\nShowcase listings stand out with high-quality 3D tours, interactive floor plans Showcase listings blend high-resolution scrolling images, room-by-room photo organization, interactive floor plans, a floor plan on the map and other features into a beautiful, AI-powered listing that will give shoppers a deeper understanding of the home virtually before they ever step inside.\n\nListing Showcase's interactive floor plans help home shoppers visualize where they are in the home's layout and get a sense of its flow, making it easier to picture themselves living there. Additionally, this Showcase technology perfectly lends itself to the Zillow ImmerseTM app for Apple Vision Pro. The app is the most interactive way to explore a for-sale home, giving a panoramic 360-degree view of every room, from the ceiling to the floor \u2014 providing an online shopping experience that viewers can't find anywhere else.\n\nStory continues\n\nHiring an agent who uses this cutting-edge technology is vital, because Zillow survey data shows more than half of prospective buyers regret wasting time visiting properties they would have skipped if they had had access to the floor plan beforehand. At the same time, 79% of prospective buyers are more likely to view a listing if it includes a floor plan that appeals to them. Additionally, 3 out of 4 prospective buyers recognize the value of a dynamic floor plan, which links each photo to where it was taken in the floor plan, providing the best possible understanding of whether a particular home is the right fit for their needs.\n\n\"Selling a home, often a person's largest financial asset, can be an overwhelming, complex, emotional process,\" said Cynthia Taylor, vice president of product at ShowingTime+. \"A listing agent who uses Showcase can play a crucial role in the process, offering peace of mind with a top Zillow listing and securing the best price, quickly \u2014 which helps ensure a smooth transition to the next chapter.\"\n\nA great real estate agent does much more than stick a sign in the yard \u2014 such an agent determines the marketing strategy for your home, leveraging tools like Showcase, recommending the best time to list and advising which features tap into trends that help homes sell.\n\nAbout Zillow Group: Zillow Group, Inc.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of retirement savings, relocation, and pros and cons of retiring in New Jersey, you may go directly to 5 Best Places to Retire in New Jersey.\n\nRetirement Savings\n\nAs people draw the curtains on their professional careers and look to begin the final act of their lives, they are confronted with the inevitable question, Do I have enough money to retire comfortably? The answer depends on a variety of factors that include, but aren\u2019t limited to, post-retirement income, desired standard of living, taxation, and housing expenses. However, as a rule of thumb, Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) recommends having savings of 25 times the withdrawal of your first year of retirement. As per Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW), a reasonable estimate for this withdrawal would be 75-80% of the annual pre-retirement income.\n\nUnfortunately, accumulating such a vast nest egg is no mean feat. According to Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW), even if you start saving for retirement in your 20s, it would require savings between 10-15% of every paycheck for the remainder of your career to accumulate enough funds for a comfortable retirement. If you find this thought challenging, you aren\u2019t alone. Based on Northwestern Mutual\u2019s 2024 Planning and Progress Study, among generations closest to retirement, just half of Boomers+ (49%) and Gen X (48%) believe they will be financially prepared when the time comes.\n\nThe same study by Northwestern Mutual revealed that the average amount US adults have saved for retirement is just $88,400. This is just $900 higher than the average amount saved for retirement in 2020, which stood at $87,500. In the same period, the amount of money people believe they need to retire comfortably has soared. According to Northwestern Mutual, in 2020 the average US adult used to believe that $951,000 was enough to retire comfortably. However, in 2024, people\u2019s magic number for a comfortable retirement has increased to $1.46 million.\n\nRetirement Relocation\n\nOwing to such a huge gap, it\u2019s reasonable to see why so many retirees choose to relocate for their retirement. According to a report by Hire a Helper, more than 338,000 Americans moved to retire in 2023, an increase of 44% compared to 2022. Our article on best places to retire in the South reveals that many retirees are choosing to move away from the Snow Belt to the Sun Belt. The article reveals that while the warm and welcoming weather of Southern states is an important factor in this migration, cost of living, affordability, and lower taxes also tend to attract retirees to the Sun Belt.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis observation is visible in data shared by U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL) in their list of Top Growth States in 2023 which shows that the most popular destinations of one-way U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE: UHAL) customers were Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas. In comparison, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan were 3 of the bottom 5 states in U-Haul Holding Company\u2019s (NYSE: UHAL) list of Top Growth States in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, based on the 47th Annual National Movers Study by United Van Lines, New Jersey was ranked as the number one moved-from state in the US. According to the study, 65% of state-to-state moves handled by United Van Lines in New Jersey were outbound. Moreover, the top reason for relocating was retirement.\n\nPros and Cons of Retiring in New Jersey\n\nThere are several reasons New Jersey is an unpopular retirement destination. Firstly, the average cost of living in New Jersey is 19.8% higher than the US average. Moreover, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) reports that the median home price in New Jersey in February 2024 was $477,500. This is nearly 15% higher than the national median home price of $411,877, as reported by Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN).\n\nIn addition to high costs, taxes are another concern when retiring in New Jersey. Although social security is exempt from taxation, and other forms of retirement income may be eligible for deductions (depending on income levels), New Jersey has one of the highest property taxes in country. For these reasons, New Jersey recently featured in our list of worst states to retire in 2024.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re in the position to spend some extra bucks towards your retirement, there are plenty of reasons to consider New Jersey a good retirement state. Its coastline boasts a treasure trove of beautiful beaches, there are plenty of forests and parks dispersed throughout the state, and it is home to some of the most popular boardwalks on the East Coast. Furthermore, the state is equipped with an extensive public transport system which, apart from day-to-day travel, also allows residents to entertain themselves with the sights and sounds of New York and Philadelphia.\n\nIn addition, like any other state, there are plenty of spots where you can retire in New Jersey on a budget, whilst also finding the right balance of comfort and entertainment.\u00a0 Join us as we look at the best places to retire in New Jersey.\n\nAlternatively, if you're interested in the best places to retire on the East Coast, check out 16 East Coast Cities to Retire on $3000 a Month or Less.

        "content": "Inventory and rate lock are deciding factors in market competition this spring\n\nCompetition is stiff for attractive listings; homes that sold in March did so in just 13 days. Seasonal home value growth is fastest in the most expensive major metros \u2014 all West Coast tech hubs. More than 1 in 5 sellers cut prices in March, the highest share in more than a decade.\n\nSEATTLE, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Those shopping for homes this spring are feeling vastly different levels of market heat depending on where they're looking. Inventory is a critical factor, the latest market report1 from Zillow\u00ae shows. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"Shoppers in the market today should expect competition, especially for attractive listings on the lower end of the price range \u2014 a rare opportunity these days,\" said Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist. \"That's kept prices ticking upward in most areas, despite affordability challenges. There are places where new construction relieved some pressure, and where homeowners are less locked into their mortgage, but not in the nation's most expensive metros. In costly areas, homeowners hold extensive mortgage debt at previously low rates, and the pressure is dialed up even further.\"\n\nBuyers in the most expensive major U.S. metros are seeing prices ramp up faster than anywhere else. Monthly home value growth is highest in the coastal California metros and Seattle, topping out at 3.3% in San Jose. San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego and Los Angeles follow, with price growth of 2% or more.\n\nThese five metros are the most expensive markets among the 50 largest in the U.S. It's no coincidence that these areas are also where the highest share of homeowners are likely locked into their mortgage. That's because it's so much more expensive to buy at today's rates.\n\nBidding wars are common in these markets, all of which ranked among the top 10 for share of homes sold over asking price in February, the most recent data available. Buyers are competing over few choices; all of these metros have seen below-average recovery in inventory compared to before the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, appreciation is subdued in Southern metros, where existing inventory has grown or nearly recovered since the outset of the pandemic. Metros with the slowest \u2014 but still fairly strong \u2014 growth are New Orleans, San Antonio, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville; all clock in at just over 0.5% appreciation month over month.\n\nNew construction is providing a pressure-relief valve in these metros, giving buyers who want to move up a place to go. New listings of existing homes have risen from pre-pandemic levels in New Orleans and Austin, while San Antonio and the Florida metros noted above have seen some of the smallest drop-offs.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecovering inventory in these areas has helped ease competition and bring price appreciation under control. New Orleans, Austin and San Antonio are the three markets where buyers actually have more choices than before the pandemic, while Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville are down just 9% \u2014 tied for the second-smallest drop.\n\nNationwide, the divide between hot and cold listings persists. In many markets where new and total inventory has recovered, buyers are gaining traction in negotiations.\n\nHomes that sold in March did so in just 13 days. That's slightly slower than at this time in 2021 or 2022, but far faster than the pre-pandemic norm. Buyers can expect well-marketed and competitively priced properties to fly off the shelves even faster in April and May, as competition ramps up. But other listings are loitering; the median age of all listings on Zillow is 43 days.\n\nRelatively affordable markets in the Midwest as well as expensive coastal metros like Seattle and Washington, D.C., have extremely short times on market for listings that sell, nearly matching those from the buying frenzy at the peak of the pandemic. Sold homes were listed for a week or less in 17 major metros.\n\nA similar story emerges when looking at listings with price cuts versus those sold over list price. More than 1 in 5 sellers cut their list price in March, the largest share for this time of year in more than a decade. Places where cuts are the most common are Tampa, Phoenix, Jacksonville, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly 27% of homes sold over list price in February, compared to less than 19% in 2019. Sellers who price their home correctly, and amp up their real and digital curb appeal, shouldn't have a problem cashing out and moving on.\n\nMetropolitan \r\nArea*

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places in Minnesota for a couple to live on only Social Security. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on Social Security retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places in Minnesota for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nMarriage, Retirement, and Social Security Incomes\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the majority of Americans enter retirement while married. The number - nearly 60% - greatly trumps the small portion of widowed American retirees which account for 20% of the 65 and above population.\n\nWhile marriage may be a retirement time norm, its adverse counterpart - divorce - also becomes more prevalent as individuals near retirement. For baby boomers specifically, Forbes reports an increasing divorce rate. For three age groups, namely, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 and above the divorce rate is 46%, 39%, and 24% respectively. Not only does marriage and its termination weigh heavily on emotional sentiments, but it also has a financial toll. After all, the US tops the list of countries that spend the most on weddings with the average American wedding costing a sizeable $29,200.\u00a0As for a divorce, the Motley Fool places the average cost around $11,300.\n\nBrown, a professor of Sociology at Bowling Green State University, talks about how a divorce later on in life when one's health and wealth are not favorable can be anything but a benign event. Especially since Social Security and related benefits are often tied to an individual's marital status.\n\n\"But for other people getting divorced in their 50s, 60s, or beyond, if they are precarious from an economic standpoint, if they are having health issues, or if they didn\u2019t want to get divorced, it can be challenging and difficult. Longer term, we have to consider\u2014what does divorce mean for the experience of aging?\" -Susan L Brown, Professor of Sociology at Bowling Green State University and Journal Author\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the cost of marriage is one thing, its financial impact lasts much longer. For instance, an individual\u2019s retirement income is often determined by their marital status, with the amount they receive in Social Security payments depending on it. In 2024, Social Security income for a retired couple is $3,818 per month on average, with the exact amount varying based on whether both spouses were previously working or not. In order to be eligible for spousal Social Security benefits as the spouse of a retired worker, an individual must be at least 62 years old, caring for a child under the age of 16, or caring for a disabled child.\n\nSocial Security Income vs. Minnesota\n\nA retirement spent on Social Security checks can be limiting. One of the biggest determinants of how far your Social Security income goes is your retirement destination - and for some retired couples, their destination of choice is Minnesota. So, how does a Social Security income fare in the state of Minnesota, and is Minnesota an affordable place to live for retirees?\n\nStarting with the biggest expense, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) lists the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom property in Minnesota to sit at $1,100. As for groceries, Zippia estimates monthly per person expenditure to be $395.39 for Minnesota residents - for a couple, this doubles to $790.78. Healthcare is next, with Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) subsidiary RBC Wealth Management estimating medical costs for a healthy retired couple to sit at a high $950.\n\nAdd these up, and your total comes out to $2,841 - a number that may not sit well with some retired couples surviving solely on Social Security checks. While high, this number doesn\u2019t mean that affording a Minnesota retirement is impossible for retired couples surviving on a Social Security income. All that it requires is thoughtful, strategic planning - and compared to other states such as Rhode Island and Florida, a Minnesota retirement may actually be much more affordable.\n\nTo facilitate retired couples who are pondering the move to Minnesota, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places in Minnesota for a couple to live on only Social Security. 15 Best Places in Minnesota For A Couple To Live On Only Social Security\n\nImage by coombesy from Pixabay\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places in Minnesota for a couple to live on only social security, we consulted several articles including our list of 51 Best Cities to Retire on $3,500 a Month, Nasdaq, SoFi, Niche, Movoto, Unbiased, and WorldAtlas. Once a list of places was compiled, we ranked them on their average monthly figure for a one-bedroom rental, their livability scores, and their cost of living. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places held a high quality of living, we removed cities with a livability score below 70. A unique Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each place based on these factors, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places in Minnesota for a couple to live on only social security. For cities that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places in Minnesota for a couple to live on only Social Security:\n\n15.

        "title": "The only housing markets with fresh supply are those loaded with baby boomers who are unbothered by higher mortgage rates",
        "content": "Existing home sales fell to their lowest point in almost three decades last year, and a lot of that was because of the so-called lock-in effect. It refers to homeowners who have locked in below-market mortgage rates and refuse to sell when rates are higher. You can imagine why someone with a 3% mortgage rate wouldn\u2019t want to give that up, let alone for an 8% rate.\n\nBut mortgage rates have come down since, and the average 30-year fixed rate is 7.11%. But that\u2019s still high compared with the historical lows throughout the pandemic and years before. And while there is some evidence indicating the lock-in effect is easing, Zillow senior economist Orphe Divounguy seems to debunk that.\n\nIn February, new listings rose 21% from the same month last year. However, \u201cmuch of the monthly increase occurred in markets which have a disproportionately higher number of homeowners that aren\u2019t hamstrung by mortgage rate lock-in,\u201d he wrote in an analysis published today.\n\nMetropolitan areas with the highest share of mortgage-free homeowners saw the largest increase in listings, Zillow said. And almost 11 million homeowners don\u2019t have a mortgage and are \u201cmortgage-ready,\u201d according to Zillow, which means they can comfortably afford a new mortgage, even at these rates.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, most of these homeowners belong to older generations, having built equity in their home(s) over the span of many years, and/or those who live in more affordable markets,\u201d Divounguy wrote.\n\nBasically, homeowners who have paid off their mortgage, while their home values appreciated, can afford another home with or without a 7% mortgage rate. You can guess which generations those are. Baby boomers and their predecessors from the silent generation are generally the least affected by changes in mortgage rates. Fourteen percent of homeowners in the silent generation aren\u2019t locked in, and 17% of baby boomers who own their homes (the largest homeowner generation by Zillow\u2019s estimate) are free of the lock-in effect. To compare, only 6% of millennial homeowners don\u2019t have to worry about the lock-in effect, per Zillow.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd it\u2019s metropolitan areas such as Detroit, Cleveland, Oklahoma City, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh where homeowners are the least likely to be affected by changes in rates, according to Zillow. For instance, 27% of homeowners in Pittsburgh are what Zillow calls \u201cfree of rate-lock.\u201d In Buffalo, it\u2019s 23%; in Cleveland, it\u2019s 22%.\n\nMeanwhile, in four California cities only 3% of their homeowner populations don\u2019t have to worry about mortgage rates and feeling locked in; those are of course the usual suspects: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose. California is chronically undersupplied, and that\u2019s reflected in remarkably high home prices. The lock-in effect hasn\u2019t helped in the state, or country as a whole.\n\n\u201cResearch shows that mortgage rate lock-in led to a 18% reduction in the probability of a home sale for every percentage point that market mortgage rates exceeded a homeowners\u2019 origination mortgage rate, thus preventing roughly 1.33 million transactions between the second quarter of 2022 and the end of 2023,\u201d Divounguy wrote. \u201cThe supply reduction increased home prices by 5.7%, even as demand for housing slowed amid very challenging affordability conditions.\u201d\n\nStill, as JPMorgan global market strategist, Stephanie Aliaga, recently said: \u201cSupply is beginning to thaw, with our measure of seasonally adjusted existing homes for sale showing a steady upward trend since last spring.\u201d And as data from the National Association of Realtors shows, existing home sales jumped in February; it was the largest monthly increase in a year.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what existing home sales looked like last month soon, but as Fortune has previously reported, this year\u2019s spring shopping and selling season might be more of a mini version of what we\u2019d typically see, because mortgage rates are still high and so are home prices\u2014but incomes haven\u2019t kept up, and we\u2019re missing millions of homes.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Vermont. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Vermont.\n\nFinding Happiness in the American Retirement\n\nAccording to a survey from insurance firm MassMutual, about 33% of senior citizens do not report an increase in happiness post-retirement. Of these 33%, an estimated half report feeling lonely in retirement and attribute this loneliness to their stagnant or decreasing levels of happiness.\n\nEmotional and mental distress is a common element post retirement. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, 14% of individuals over the age of 60 suffer from a mental disorder. The reasons behind this are multifold. A loss of functional ability, adverse experiences with ageism, social isolation, and exposure to abuse are just some of the contributing factors. As such, older adults often spend the latter portion of their lives battling conditions such as depression, anxiety, and dementia.\n\nWhile seeking mental health support may be difficult for senior citizens, there are several resources available for their aid. Mental health companies such as Talkspace, Inc. (NASDAQ:TALK) and LifeStance Health Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LFST) offer a range of in-person and online mental health services, accepting a variety of insurance plans too. With licensed therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists on board, companies such as LifeStance Health Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LFST) and Talkspace, Inc. (NASDAQ:TALK) cater to several mental health conditions - including depression and anxiety.\n\nOf course, another major contributing factor to how fulfilled and content an individual is during retirement is their retirement destination. Moving for retirement is a common American trend, and senior citizens are varied in their choice of retirement states, with the mountainous state of Vermont being a popular choice in recent years.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaking a Retirement in the Green Mountain State\n\nHome of the Green Mountains range, Vermont has claimed the twelfth spot in U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)\u2019s 2023 ranking of top growth states. A massive climb from its thirtieth spot in U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)\u2019s 2022 ranking, the state is seeing more and more retirees pour in.\n\nIn fact, Senior Living reports that a whopping 41.9% of Vermont\u2019s population is in the 50 and above category. This makes it the state with the second-highest ratio of seniors in its population, trailing only behind Maine. On the whole, it seems like Vermont\u2019s senior citizens are financially on par with the rest of the country. The state reports a median household income of $42,932 for those aged 65 and over -\u00a0 a mere $803 below the US median of $43,735.\n\nWhile senior citizen household income may match national numbers, it\u2019s safe to say that Vermont is an expensive state to retire to. Starting with the state\u2019s rental market, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) reports Vermont\u2019s average rent for a one-bedroom property to be a high $1,695. This is a whole 6% higher than the US average, and even the lowest one-bedroom rental listed on Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) is a monthly $840 - a big ask for retirees living on Social Security checks.\n\nAs for Vermont\u2019s housing market, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) lists the average Vermont house to sit at $361,300. Although this is below the US median, it still depicts a 6.2% year-on-year increase - not good news for those looking to become retirement-time homeowners. Among the most competitive cities in Vermont when it comes to property prices are Essex Junction, Wells River, and Swanton.\n\nOne of the biggest hits to the Vermont retiree is the state\u2019s unfavorable tax policies. Labeled \u2018not tax-friendly\u2019, Vermont is one of the only US states to tax Social Security income, with a partial taxation system being applied here. Retirement account withdrawals are fully taxed, as are private and public pension incomes. With states such as Alaska and Wyoming which don\u2019t tax Social Security income or pension, Vermont in comparison pales.\n\nThis is not to say that retirement in Vermont is always financially damaging. There are many towns and cities within the state that offer a cost of living that is lower than the national average. Financials aside, a Vermont retirement also carries other benefits. One of the best parts about living in Vermont is the healthcare. Named as one of the states with the best healthcare in the US, only 5% of Vermont\u2019s adult population is uninsured. All of this brings us down to the main question - is Vermont a good state for retirement? With the right research, planning, and decisions, a Vermont retirement can prove to be a very happy and comfortable retirement - all you need to be is prepared.\n\nIn fact, Vermont\u2019s title as one of the best states to live in for 2024 is a testament to this. Some of the state\u2019s winning qualities are its supreme air quality, access to majestic nature, and high level of safety - all important aspects to consider during retirement.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Vermont state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Vermont. 15 Best Places to Retire in Vermont\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Vermont, we consulted several sources including our list of the 15 Most Affordable Places to Retire on the East Coast, Niche, Unbiased, The Travel, Movoto, and WorldAtlas.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their cost of living, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) and Realtor, whereas the cost of living index was Insider Monkey\u2019s own. Our cost of living index covers housing, utilities, food, transport, taxes, and healthcare, where an index score of 100 depicts the US national average. To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard, we removed any places with a livability score of below 60. A cumulative score was then assigned to each place, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Vermont.\n\nFor places that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. Our list is presented in ascending order. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "If you've been looking for a home and you feel like your money isn't going as far as it did before the pandemic, it's not your imagination playing tricks on you. According to a recent study by Zillow, today's homebuyer needs to earn an estimated $50,000 per year more than they did before the pandemic to afford a home without stretching their finances beyond reasonable limits.\n\nThis grim statistic is another harsh reminder of how difficult today's housing market is for most homebuyers. It's also why housing affordability has become a bona fide campaign issue up and down the ballot in elections all over the country.\u00a0 Although it would be tempting to blame one single factor for the state of the housing market, the reality is that several factors are working against prospective homeowners.\n\nIt's More Complicated Than Rounding Up The Usual Suspects\n\nIn boxing, they say that the punches you don't see coming are the ones that do the most damage. The post-pandemic housing market is a perfect example of a case where prospective buyers were braced for one punch, only to be nearly completely floored by one they didn't see coming. Home prices were high before and during the pandemic, but interest rates in the two and three-percent range cushioned the price shock for buyers.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Want To Grow Your Wealth Passively? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail\n\nWhat no one saw coming was the nearly 43% rise in home values nationwide since 2020 as reported by Zillow. A 43% spike in prices over three years is one thing, but when it comes on the heels of mortgage rates climbing into six- and seven-percent territory, you have two blows that few buyers saw coming. The impact of this unexpected one-two punch on the housing market has been profound.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Lack Of Inventory And Slow Wage Growth Are Factors\n\nFirst, there is the inventory problem. Price and interest rate spikes don't just affect buyers' behavior. People who financed houses before the pandemic with 30-year fixed-rate loans in the good old days of sub-three-percent interest rates are referred to as having golden handcuffs because what they can buy at post-pandemic prices and interest rates is not an upgrade on what they own.\n\nThis has led to a sort of doom loop where even baby boomers at the age where previous generations sold their single-family homes and downsized are choosing to stay put.\u00a0 Any time there is a lack of inventory, the scarcity exerts intense upward pressure on the prices of homes that do hit the market. Unfortunately for prospective buyers, their post-pandemic wages haven't increased nearly enough to compensate for the increase in prices and mortgage rates.\n\nTrending\n\nMiami Is Expected To Take New York's Place As The US Financial Capital. Invest In It With $500 Before That Happens.\n\nThe Ugly Math For Post-Pandemic Homebuyers\n\nAccording to the Zillow study, an American household with a $59,000 annual income and a 10% down payment could comfortably afford to pay the mortgage on the average American house in 2020. The standard for mortgage affordability was a monthly payment that didn't exceed 30% of the buyer's monthly earnings. At the time, the median household income in America was $66,000, which means millions of Americans could afford to buy an average home.\n\nAlthough Zillow estimated the average American household's annual post-pandemic income has risen to $81,000, buyers with a 10% down payment would need to earn over $100,000 annually to comfortably afford the same home they could have bought before the pandemic on a $59,000 annual income.\u00a0 Perhaps the scariest part about these numbers is that they reflect the income needed to buy the average home in America today.\n\nBuyers in what have traditionally been America's most sought-after cities, such as New York or Los Angeles, need to earn considerably more than $100,000 to afford the average home in those markets. The same Zillow study showed that the median income necessary to comfortably afford a home in Los Angeles is $279,000. That might explain why Cleveland, where a $70,000 annual income still gets you an average house, is one of America's hottest housing markets.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Washington. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement in Washington , you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Washington.\n\nNavigating Retirement in Washington: Finding Affordable Bliss Amidst High Costs\n\nThe state of Washington, renowned for its unparalleled natural beauty and vibrant city life, can be a dream retirement destination. Although its cost of living is notoriously high, even those on a fixed income can manage to retire here with proactive planning and budgeting. Our list on best places to retire in Washington on Social Security can help potential retirees explore such destinations. Forbes estimates that the annual cost of living in this state is approximately $47,231, averaging out to an estimated $3,936 per month. The cost of home-ownership in this state also surpasses the national average. According to real estate and mortgage company Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), the median price of a home in the state is $617,700 as of February 2024. Home prices have witnessed an 8.3% rise compared to last year, while the number of homes sold fell by 0.64% year-over-year. For those who wish to rent, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) reports the median rent for all bedrooms and property types to be $1,940. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) notes that the median rent price in the state as of March 2024 is $150 less than what it was back in March 2023. The real estate company states that this average is $110 less than the national median. While this may be so, median home price is considerably higher than the national average. Overall, the cost of living is 16% higher than the national average.\n\nConsidering the high cost of living, many retirees wonder whether Washington is a retirement friendly state. If yes, the next question they ask is what part of Washington is the best place to live? While the answer isn\u2019t that simple, retiring to this beautiful part of paradise isn\u2019t impossible. The popularity of this state is evident as highlighted by a report from U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL). U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), an American moving truck, trailer, and self-storage Rental Company revealed its report on the top growth states to move for 2023. While states such as Texas and Florida were the clear winners considering they don\u2019t tax retirement income, offer low costs of living, and even boast the best weather, the state of Washington has also managed to round out the top 10 states for growth. The largest increases in one-way rentals went into the state of Washington, along with Arkansas, Wyoming, Vermont, Delaware, and South Dakota.\n\nStory continues\n\nU-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)\u2019s report on Washington reveals that individuals still consider the state a desirable place to move to. Even for retirees, there are many pros and cons of retiring in Washington State. For starters, it is one of the 13 states that don\u2019t tax retirement income. Seniors in the state get to enjoy their income tax-free at the state level. Moreover, since the state doesn\u2019t have an income tax, retirees who choose to work even after retirement can enjoy their income without paying taxes. While this may be a major advantage, retirees should also know that this state heavily relies on sales taxes for its revenues. The sales tax rate statewide is 6.5%. Moreover, additional levies are also imposed by certain counties and cities, which pushed up the sales tax burden to up to 10.5%.\n\nWashington also happens to be one of the healthiest states in the US. As of 2020, the life expectancy reported in the state was 79.2 years. Around 33% of adults reported a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 in 2021, while 86% of adults also reported a positive health status in year 2022. 15 Best Places to Retire in Washington\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of best places to retire in Washington, we consulted several sources such as our list of best places in Washington State for a couple to live on only Social Security, as well other such as New Home Source, Movoto, and Retirable. Next, we rounded up a list of best places through a consensus approach, further ranking them on their cost of living, livability, and housing affordability. Each place was scored on each factor and scores were summed up to generate a unique Insider Monkey Score. Finally, places have been arranged in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 places to retire that are just like the West Coast but cheaper. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on insights and perspectives amidst rising prices, you may go to 5 Places to Retire That Are Just Like the West Coast but Cheaper.\n\nInsights and Perspectives Amidst Rising Prices and Opportunities for Retirees Seeking the West Coast Vibe\n\nAccording to updates from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), the housing market is witnessing a surge in available homes, just in time for the spring home-buying season. This increase in inventory is enticing prospective buyers to make their move. However, Forbes seems cynical that buying and selling activity in the market may not fully \u201cbloom\u201d. Due to factors such as mortgage rates and home prices that are still considered \u201chigh\u201d, and a housing stock that has been \u201chistorically-low\u201d, home-ownership still seems out of reach for a majority of home buyers.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it isn\u2019t all bad news considering new listings have witnessed their highest uptick in three years.\n\nDuring the four weeks ending March 24, US monthly housing payment hit an all-time high at $2,721. Median home has also increased 5% year-over-year, reaching $375,000. These rising prices have been in turn encouraging sellers to take advantage, notes Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). Moreover, the increase in supply is also helping to bring some of the demand back.\n\n\"High mortgage rates aren\u2019t deterring buyers as much as they were last year; a lot of people want to get in now before prices go up more. All of my recent listings have gone under contract in under 10 days, and most of them have received multiple offers. Buyers are lessening the impact of elevated rates in a few ways: Some are making high down payments to lower their monthly payments, and some are willing to take on a high rate now in hopes of refinancing when and if rates come down.\u201d\n\n-Miami Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) agent Rachel Riva.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless of the rising home prices, a recent Realtor report says that home-buyers are still likely to save some in housing markets, which includes the pricey West Coast. Here is what a Chief Economist from Realtor has to say,\n\n\"A lot of the [housing] inventory that\u2019s coming onto the market is in a more affordable price tier. When you have more affordable listings coming onto the market, it\u2019s also going to push down the overall price.\"\n\n- Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale.\n\nRegardless of how much savings buying a home in these markets can bring one, it\u2019s highly unlikely that those on fixed incomes will choose to buy a home in the West Coast. States like California, Washington, and Alaska all have a high cost of living and home prices, which usually steer\u00a0 individuals away from such areas. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) notes the average California home to be priced at $765,197, up 5.4% over the past year. Similarly, the average Washington home value is $575,894, up 2.6% over the past year, states Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z). Rents in these states are higher than what the average retiree is getting out of their Social Security check anyway, while the cost of living adds another layer of financial strain.\n\nFor those who love the West-Coast vibe but can\u2019t afford its price tag, finding a replacement can help. In this case, one state that is like California but cheaper is Oregon. Oregon\u2019s coastal charm is very similar to that of the Golden State, and many of its cities also come with a cheaper price tag. Yet many other states and cities are available in the USA that retirees can explore to remind them of the West-Coast vibe that they crave without breaking their bank. All they have to do is to look in the right places. 15 Places to Retire That Are Just Like the West Coast but Cheaper\n\nJASON TENCH/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of places to retire that are just like the West Coast but cheaper, we sifted through various online forums and reputable websites and crafted a comprehensive list of places that are reminiscent of the West-Coast vibe. Next, we ranked them on their cost of living, median home prices, rents, and livability scores. Scores were summed up to generate an Insider Monkey score, and places were ranked in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores. Please note that perceptions of what constitutes a \"West Coast vibe\" may vary, and individual preferences should be considered when selecting a retirement destination.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 16 top alternatives to Zillow and Trulia. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Top Alternatives to Zillow and Trulia.\n\nGlobal Real Estate Market: At A Glance\n\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global real estate market was valued at $3.81 trillion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030, to reach a valuation of $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. The Asia Pacific region dominated the global real estate market in 2021 with a market share of 52.6%. China contributed 64.8% to the share of the region in the global market. However, recent trends are telling a different story. On February 2, CNBC reported that housing demand is set to drop by 50% in China in the coming decade. The decline has been predicted by the IMF and is expected to weaken the country's already slowing economy. China's GDP growth is expected to slow to 4.6% this year, down from 5.2% in 2023. This is due to a decline in new urban households and a large overhang of unfinished properties. The government is taking steps to ease financing restrictions and complete unfinished housing projects at the earliest. The IMF recommends additional monetary easing and proactive fiscal policy to support growth.\n\nMiddle East and Africa are expected to have a high CAGR of 6.3% during the forecasted period. The rising number of commercial and residential projects in the region is expected to fuel the growth of the region.\n\nOne of the major trends boosting the growth of the global great estate market is the use of online real estate services. The penetration of the Internet and digital devices has made online real estate services a popular choice among consumers. Online real estate platforms are constantly innovating to retain customers by introducing a variety of features including live-streaming properties and incorporating immersive reality. Zillow 3D Home is a feature offered by Zillow that allows users to create immersive virtual home tours using the Zillow 3D Home app. It enhances the chances of seller listings being viewed by adding virtual tours for free. By capturing every room in a home using supported devices including iPhones, Android smartphones, or 360-degree cameras, users can create interactive floor plans.\n\nStory continues\n\nNoteworthy Companies in the Tech Real Estate Marketplace\n\nZillow Group Inc (NASDAQ:Z), Opendoor Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:OPEN), and Redfin Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN) are notable companies with online real estate platforms.\n\nZillow Group Inc (NASDAQ:Z) is a giant in the online real estate industry.

Residential revenue of $349 million increased 3% year-over-year, returning to positive year-over-year growth. During the same timeframe, the broader real estate industry declined by 4%, meaning Zillow\u2019s residential revenue outperformed the industry by 700 basis points. As I said, Q4 now marks the sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful outperformance versus the industry. Our ongoing efforts to improve our customer funnel, capture more demand, connect more of that demand to our partner network, and focus on conversion, continue to drive impressive results. Rentals also had a strong quarter with accelerating revenue growth, up 37% year-over-year to $93 million.\"\n\nOpendoor Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:OPEN) offers a digital platform for residential real estate transactions, offering services for buying and selling homes through a mobile device. \u00a0The company is rapidly innovating by integrating the latest tech solutions into its platform.

        "content": "This article takes a look at 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Affordable Hidden Gem Southern Cities to Retire In.\n\nConsidering the Retirement Years Breakdown\n\nFor most adults, the forty-hour work week is what consumes the majority of their day. Add the time taken to commute, eat their meals, sleep, and work out, and little time is left over for leisure, family, and friends. What happens then when retirement rolls around and the forty-hour work week disappears, as does the commute attached to it? How does an individual with forty to fifty extra hours per week spend their time?\n\nAccording to the American Time Use Survey, the majority of a retiree\u2019s time is spent either in sleep and personal care or leisure - about ten and seven hours per day, respectively. With so many hours spent on leisure, the quality of the activities that fill this period is of the essence. While gardening, learning to play an instrument, exercising, and cooking are all fun and cheap things to do in retirement, retirees sometimes want to break out of the vicinity of their own homes. As such, the place of retirement becomes a major contributing factor, pouring into how fulfilling an individual\u2019s retirement period is.\n\nWhile America\u2019s retired population is no stranger to earning a little extra income - you\u2019ll find a host of senior citizens selling their belongings on eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or running small home businesses - there\u2019s only so much an eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) income can go. In reality, many senior citizens are relegated to a life spent on Social Security checks. These numbers, of course, are not favorable. In 2024, the average retiree will receive a meager $1,907 per month according to the Social Security Administration. Take out rent, utilities, groceries, and healthcare, and not a whole lot is left.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s two factors to consider when deciding on where to retire - affordability and the quality of life that the area provides. This brings American retirees to a choice - retire abroad or within the States. A retirement abroad boasts its own benefits - the cost of living is often lower due to currency values, senior citizens get to explore new cultures, and the weather can often be more favorable. Those who do decide to embark on an overseas retirement often search for the most affordable places to retire in the world.\n\nOf course, not every retiree will want to leave the States. Some have family and friends that they want to stay close to, some have health issues that prevent them from traveling long distances, and others still will not jump for joy at the thought of moving to a completely new country with new languages, cuisines, and cultures. For these, the main question remains - where to retire in America?\n\nWith how vast America is, thinning down your options becomes a task in itself. The South of America, however, is a considerable option. Many Southern cities boast lower costs of living, favorable climates, and of course, delectable Southern delicacies. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) states that the average US one-bedroom rental sits at $1,599, a figure that is lower in many Southern states. For instance, Delaware's figure is $1,425, North Carolina's is $1,200, and West Virginia's is $750.\n\nSimilarly, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) quotes the average US house to be priced at $412,219. This number is considerably higher than Georgia's median of $361,800, Kentucky's $250,400, and Arkansas' $240,900. For retirees who may be surviving on Social Security checks - a mere $1,907 a month in 2024 according to the Social Security Administration - or an otherwise limited budget, the South's price-friendly accommodation acts as a strong pull factor.\n\nTo facilitate present and future retirees in contemplating a retirement move to the South, we have compiled the following list of 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in. 15 Affordable Hidden Gem Southern Cities to Retire In\n\nPixabay/Public domain\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in, we consulted several sources including our list of 20 Best Kept Secret Places to Retire in USA, as well as external sources like Southern Living, U.S. News & World Report, Finance Buzz, and The Travel. The United States Census Bureau defines the following states as Southern: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their average figure for a one-bedroom rental, their average monthly grocery bill for a single person, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) and Zumper, grocery figures were taken from the Economic Policy Institute, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). Once these rankings were assigned, places that did not have one-bedroom rental listings were removed. A cumulative score was then assigned to each city, with the 15 highest-scoring cities making our list of 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in.\n\nFor cities that gained an equal score, their rent figures were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last.\n\nIt is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in:\n\n15.

However, a second look proves that Huntsville may be the ideal retirement spot. Financially, the city offers a low cost of living - retirees surviving on Social Security may want to take notes - along with a low median house price. On the leisure side, the city offers a range of indoor and outdoor activities with something for every retiree\u2019s taste.\n\n11.

        "content": "In a recent settlement, the National Association of Realtors agreed to change its rule so that anyone who lists a home for sale on any of its databases can no longer offer commission to the buyer's agent.\n\nIf the court approves the settlement, the rule change would take place in mid-July. This could bring about a future where the seller would no longer be paying for the buyer's agent, leading to more buyers being their own agents.\n\nThe changes would \"decouple\" the commissions owed to the buyer and seller agents, allowing more flexibility in negotiation, according to Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share. US military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here\u2019s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.\n\nHe estimates that over time, a home being sold for $500,000 would save $10,000 in commission costs, potentially lowering the price of homes being sold.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that buyers will benefit from the rule change, at least in the short term.\n\nLei Wedge, an associate professor specializing in real estate and investments at the University of South Florida, told Yahoo! Finance that \"it's going to be worse for the buyer\" because \"buyers will [probably] end up paying more money for the home because now they have to come up with a commission to pay their buyer agent because this is a seller\u2019s market.\"\n\nTrending: Fortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\nEven with those concerns, Wedge remains optimistic that over the longer term, it'll bring progress in lowering costs as \"[in] the rest of the world, the commission to sell a property is 2% to 3% ... there\u2019s no reason the average cost of selling a property in the United States is 5.49%.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMarkets have already started to price in the prospect of a major shake-up to the commission structure that occurs in today's real estate transactions.\n\nBefore the settlement was determined, financial services firm Morningstar singled out CoStar Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP), which owns homes.com, as a beneficiary, saying, \"Homes.com should be largely unaffected from the direct implications of this lawsuit as it aims to monetize just one side of the transaction by selling advertisement products to enhance the exposure of seller listings on its platform.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Morningstar argued that \"real estate portals like Zillow and Realtor.com stand to lose the most from the impacts of this decision as they make most of their revenue by routing buyer leads to real estate agents that buy its advertising products. Since the lawsuit mainly targets the buyer-side brokerage commission, therefore it can have a significant impact on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Realtor.com.\"\n\nThe stocks of CoStar and Zillow have diverged accordingly, with CoStar up about 18% in the past month compared to Zillow down over 3%.\n\nRegardless of how the situation plays out, it's left those in the real estate industry with significant uncertainty. According to Belinda Tucker, a Realtor who owns a firm in North Carolina, the changes will either \"turn out to be a good thing\" or \"could turn out to be the worst thing ever.\"\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

        "content": "March 25 (Reuters) - Tinder-owner Match Group named Instacart executive Laura Jones and Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff to its board on Monday, after talks with activist investor Elliott Investment Management to improve its performance.\n\nJones is the chief marketing officer at Instacart while Rascoff has served as Zillow's CEO for a decade after co-founding the real estate firm in 2006.\n\nGrowth has slowed at Match from the peaks hit during the pandemic, as economic uncertainty and a lack of new features prompt people to cut back on spending on its dating apps.\n\nThe company tapped insider Faye Iosotaluno as CEO of Tinder in January, a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that Elliott has built a roughly $1 billion stake in the company.\n\nMatch said on Monday it has an information-sharing deal with Elliott, whose push for change at the dating firm follows a big win for the hedge fund at wireless tower operator Crown Castle in December.\n\nThe activist investor, founded by billionaire Paul Singer in 1977, forced Crown Castle last year to review its fiber business and replace two directors on its board.

        "title": "Realtor commission change delivers a boon to homebuilders, a blow to real estate platforms",
        "content": "A change to the real estate commission structure is shaking the industry \u2014 and homebuilders and consumers appear to be the winners.\n\nThis week, Compass (COMP) agreed to pay $57.5 million to settle antitrust claims related to commissions. It\u2019s the first major brokerage to announce a settlement since the National Association of Realtors (NAR) agreed to pay $418 million as part of a lawsuit alleging the industry conspired to inflate agent fees.\n\nExperts say the NAR settlement \u2014 which essentially decouples buyer and seller agent fees \u2014 is a win for consumers because it will create transparency around how commissions are set and paid and ultimately lower costs.\n\n\u201cThis will reshape the housing market in the greatest fashion we've seen in over 50 years,\u201d KBW analyst Ryan Tomasello told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).\n\nUS Realtor commissions have ranged from 5% to 6% since the 1950s, and are usually split between the seller\u2019s and buyer\u2019s agents, with the home seller footing the entire bill.\n\nIncreased transparency will make it easier for buyers to negotiate fees or bypass the use of agents entirely. Buyer agent usage in most countries is uncommon, averaging 33% compared to the US\u2019s rate of nearly 90%.\n\nFor buyers who decide to use an agent, advocates say fee costs are likely to substantially decline. Right now, US commission rates are among the highest in the world. Commissions on a $500,000 home sold in the US would be about $25,000 to $30,000 \u2014 compared to roughly $6,500 in the UK.\n\nAs a result, the total commission pool, currently $100 billion nationally, could be slashed to $70 billion, according to KBW's analysis.\n\nRead more: How to sell your house without a Realtor\n\nA 'major boost' for homebuilders\n\nChanges resulting from the NAR settlement are a \u201cmajor boost\u201d for homebuilders, who typically paid the buyer agent\u2019s commission.\n\nIn a note to clients, Evercore ISI's Stephen Kim wrote that agent commissions have been a \u201csignificant drag\u201d to builders' profitability, therefore a \u201cshift in broker fees represents a significant positive for builder margins.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis would disproportionately advantage large homebuilders, who have their own salespeople and robust online shopping environments; it is far easier to buy a new home without a buyer\u2019s agent than an existing home,\u201d wrote Kim.\n\nHomebuilder stocks have already been on the rise as high mortgage rates continue to limit the supply of used homes for sale. A reduction in commissions could help further drive demand, National Association of Home Builders CEO Jim Tobin told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\n\u201cAs commissions come down, I hope we will see costs to builders come down as well,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cThat translates into lower home prices for consumers.\u201d\n\nShares of Lennar (LEN), Toll Brothers (TOL), and PulteGroup (PHM) have rallied to record highs this year, powered in part by the NAR settlement but also on the prospect for Fed rate cuts. Toll Brothers is up about 25%, while Lennar and PulteGroup are up 12% and 14%, respectively.\n\nBrokerage models 'at risk'\n\nWhile homebuilder stocks have clocked gains in the past week, investors dumped shares of Zillow (Z), Redfin (RDFN), and Compass (COMP) on fears a change to agent fees will be costly for major brokerages.\n\nAnalysts warn of downside risk ahead, arguing the shift in cost structure is only partially priced in at current levels.\n\nIn a note to clients, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Matt Cost wrote that while there is a \u201ccredible bull case where commission levels remain stable\u201d, shares of Zillow, RE/MAX, and Compass \u201ccould decline further to the extent the market fully prices in material downside to commission rates going forward.\u201d\n\nCost emphasized Compass as the brokerage most at risk, given \u201csubstantially all of its revenue is tied to broker commissions.\u201d\n\nBut the new changes don\u2019t signal doom and gloom for all listing platforms. In an environment where more buyers will do the house hunting themselves, platforms that help sellers advertise their listings have room to grow.\n\nKBW\u2019s Tomasello thinks that CoStar Group (CSGP) is a \u201cwinner\u201d and \u201ckey beneficiary\u201d because it caters to seller agents \u2014 a focus he expects other platforms to pursue.\n\n\u201cReal estate portals that have historically relied more on the buy-side piece of this commission pool for their revenue models, [such as] companies like Zillow, Realtor.com, may need to reconsider the role that they play in the housing market and potentially shift that focus more to the sell side in terms of advertising homes,\u201d Tomasello said.\n\nCoStar shares rallied 8% after the NAR settlement was announced last Friday. Shares are up 12% year to date.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith. Tips on deals, mergers, activist situations, or anything else?

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 20 safest places to retire in the US. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Safest Places To Retire in the US.\n\nTaking your Pick in the Retirement Location Mix\n\nRetirement may be the end of the road, but it\u2019s rarely all that it\u2019s made up to be. For the average American retiree, their retirement years are riddled with financial struggles, health troubles, and often, a growing sense of loneliness. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 27% of Americans aged 60 and older live alone - 11% more than senior citizens in the 130 other countries that the research encapsulated. As for financial status, the latest United States Census reported that 10.3% of Americans aged 65 and older were living in poverty. With such dire circumstances, retirement is often about taking the best pick out of the options presented.\n\nGiven the choice, any senior citizen would want to spend their Golden Years living in a place with a reasonable cost of living that is safe and has access to good healthcare. While such locations may be difficult to come by, they do exist. Better yet, US citizens can get a head start on retirement planning and give themselves a greater budget to work with. While the amount that you\u2019re able to save for retirement depends on several factors - such as your income, the number of dependents you\u2019re supporting, and your health, amongst others - it also has to do with how well you plan out your retirement.\n\nA recent study by the MilkenInstitute stated that the ideal age at which Americans should start saving for retirement is 25 or younger. While 25 may seem too early, the math behind this is of compounding investment - the earlier you start saving, the more time you\u2019ll be able to give your savings to grow. A Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey found that Americans think they need at least $1.8 million in savings for a comfortable retirement. With such a hefty amount on the savings list, the earlier you start, the better. Even if you\u2019re not looking to amass the figure that has been attributed from the Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey, America\u2019s growing cost of living is reason enough to get a head start on retirement planning.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t always the case. According to the Milken Institute study, Baby Boomers started saving for retirement at the average age of 35, whereas Gen X began at 30. For senior citizens who are closing in on the retirement age without much in the bank, there is still hope. Many financial and investment management companies assist customers in financially securing their retirement and picks such as Mercer International Inc. (NASDAQ:MERC) and BlackRock, Inc.(NYSE:BLK) may be the answer to the financially unprepared. From portfolio management to custom financial plans, the likes of BlackRock, Inc.(NYSE:BLK) and Mercer International Inc. (NASDAQ:MERC) can help retirees plan better.\n\nOnce financially better off, senior citizens can afford to be pickier with their retirement destination choices - opting for places that offer a good quality of life while also being cheap and giving good value for money. All in all, a financially stable retiree can afford to consider the best places to retire in the US.\n\nTo facilitate present and future retirees contemplating a retirement move, we have compiled the following list of the 20 safest places to retire in the US. 20 Safest Places To Retire in the US\n\nholbox/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 20 safest places to retire in the US, we consulted several sources including The Travel, Comerica, GOBankingRates, and U.S. News & World Report. Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, how safe they are, how they score in terms of health, their median figure for a one-bedroom rental, and their average monthly grocery bill for an individual. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) and Zumper, grocery figures were taken from the Economic Policy Institute, health scores were taken from WalletHub\u2019s 2023 ranking of Healthiest & Unhealthiest Cities in America, and safety scores were taken from WalletHub\u2019s 2023 ranking of Safest Cities in America. For the healthiest cities, WalletHub used four metrics - healthcare, food, fitness, and green space. For safest cities, WalletHub used three metrics - home and community safety, natural disaster risk, and financial safety. A cumulative score was then assigned to each city where a double weightage was given to the safety score. The 20 highest-scoring cities then made up our list of the 20 safest places to retire in the US.\n\nFor cities that gained an equal score, their safety scores were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last. It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 20 safest places to retire in the US:\n\n20. Washington, DC\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 28\n\nSafety Score: 60.58\n\nHealth Score: 59.78\n\nMedian One-bedroom Rental: $2,200\n\nAverage Monthly Grocery for One: $410\n\nThe first pick on our list of the safest places to retire in the US is none other than the capital of the United States - Washington. A historical city, Washington is set on the Potomac River and is defined by its neoclassical buildings.\u00a0 The city\u2019s main features include the federal government\u2019s buildings - namely, the Capitol, the Supreme Court, and the White House - several museums, and the famed Kennedy Center.\n\n19. New York City, New York\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 30\n\nSafety Score: 70.07\n\nHealth Score: 56.33\n\nMedian One-bedroom Rental: $3,200\n\nAverage Monthly Grocery for One: $422\n\nThere\u2019s little else that compares to retiring in New York. The glamour of the Big Apple draws in retirees from all over the States, and New York\u2019s high safety score of 70 adds to the attraction. While definitely on the expensive side - the median monthly charge for a one-bedroom rental is $3,200 - there\u2019s lots that the city offers to make up for it. As for retirees who have a limited budget but an urge for a New York retirement, they can explore some of the more affordable options in the city - Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) lists rentals starting as low as $650.\n\n18.

        "content": "Shares of Zillow (Z) sank as much as 15% Friday alongside other real estate names after the National Association of Realtors reached a legal settlement that paves the way for homebuyers and sellers to pay lower commissions.\n\nThe NAR reached a nationwide settlement of claims that the industry conspired to boost agents' commissions, the organization said on Friday. If approved by a federal court, the settlement will likely usher changes to the way consumers buy and sell homes. The NAR said it will pay $418 million over the next four years to end litigation.\n\nReal estate names slid on the heels of the NAR's groundbreaking settlement. Alongside Zillow's decline, shares of Anywhere Real Estate (HOUS), Compass (COMP), and Redfin (RDFN) fell as much as 15%, 11%, and 5%, respectively.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the NAR said it would, \"put in place a new MLS rule prohibiting offers of broker compensation on the MLS,\" ending rules that had effectively required sellers to compensate a buyer's agent.\n\nThe NAR's MLS, or Multiple Listing Service, is a database where 88% of sellers listed their homes last year. Brokers who list their clients' properties in the database previously had to agree to share their commissions with other MLS participants, with commissions typically standing at 6%.\n\nBeginning in July, agents will also have to enter into written agreements with homebuyers they represent.\n\n\"It has always been our goal to preserve consumer choice and protect our members to the greatest extent possible,\" Nykia Wright, interim CEO, said in a statement. A \"sale pending\" sign is posted in front of a home for sale on November 30, 2023 in Larkspur, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nAnd at least one Wall Street analyst thinks these new rules will lead to \"commissions falling 25% to 50%.\"\n\nIn a note to clients on Friday, Jaret Seiberg, housing policy analyst for TD Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote that in addition to this drop in commissions, this ruling \"should benefit online and discount real estate brokerages. They should be able to access the Multiple Listing Service without having to meet the commission requirements that previously were in place.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSeiberg added: \"That means they can offer lower commission rates in order to attract more business. In addition, the settlement bans the inclusion of buyer agent compensation in the listing.\"\n\nIn Seiberg's view, existing homeowners \u2014 who will now pay out a smaller fee upon the sale of their home \u2014 are set to benefit most, while first-time and less-wealthy buyers may see negative impacts, as smaller commissions and no pre-arranged fee structure, could hamper agent motivation to work with these clients.\n\nThe settlement also heightens the financial and administrative woes the NAR has been facing in recent months. NAR CEO Bob Goldberg resigned last year just days after the $1.8 billion verdict against the organization over commissions. Goldberg's replacement, Tracy Kasper, later resigned in January after a blackmail threat regarding a past personal matter.\n\n\u2014\n\nDani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "New listings are up 21% annually, evidence of rate lock easing\n\nNew listings rose annually in every major metro. Total inventory rose 12% year over year; the largest gains came in the South. Competition is stiff for attractive listings; homes went pending in just 17 days nationwide.\n\nSEATTLE, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- An infusion of new inventory into the market is welcome news for buyers on the hunt for their next home this spring. It's also more evidence that the effects of \"rate lock\" on homeowners are starting to weaken, according to the latest monthly report1 from Zillow\u00ae. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"For more than a year, Zillow homeowner surveys have shown an elevated share of homeowners expecting to sell in the next three years. We're finally beginning to see owners who have been putting off moves return to the market,\" said Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow. \"For many households with record-high equity, waiting out potentially lower rates later in the year may not be worth it.\"\n\nMore choices for buyers Buyers are seeing more choices on the market, which should help spur sales this spring.\n\nNew listings of existing homes on Zillow are up 21% in February compared to last year, and rose 20% from January. The rising tide of new listings was universal; counts are up annually in each of the 50 largest U.S. metros. They're coming on strongest in the South, especially Texas and Florida. Substantial new construction in these areas is likely helping to give existing homeowners somewhere to move to, freeing up existing inventory.\n\nTotal inventory is increasing significantly as well, up 12% nationally compared to last year. At just over 900,000, there were more homes for sale in February than in any February since 2020. Annual increases are highest in Dallas (up 39%), Tampa (31%), Orlando (30%) and Miami (29%).\n\nStiff competition for attractive listings Despite February's supply increase, competition remains strong for attractive, well-priced listings. Homes that went under contract in February typically did so after 17 days \u2014 that's slower than during the rate-fueled frenzy of 2021 and 2022, but far faster than before the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nAspirationally priced listings, or those lacking real or virtual curb appeal, are lingering on the market. The average time on Zillow for all homes was 53 days, which is longer than normal for this time of year.\n\nPrice cuts are more common than normal \u2014 1 in 5 listings on Zillow are seeing cuts \u2014 as sellers bring their expectations closer to where buyers can meet them. Most sellers will have plenty of cushion to absorb a price cut and come out ahead from when they bought their home. Typical home values are up from last year in all but three major metros, and values have risen 41% nationwide since before the pandemic.\n\nHousing costs continue to climb The typical home in the U.S. is worth $349,216, according to the Zillow Home Value Index \u2014 up 40.8% compared to before the pandemic. Monthly gains were largest in expensive coastal metros: San Jose (1.6%), San Diego (1.3%), Seattle (1.2%), San Francisco (0.8%) and Washington, D.C. (0.8%).\n\nMortgage rates rose in February, helping bump the cost of a mortgage on a typical home 9.4% higher than last year. That has changed the math for home buyers, who now need to earn about 80% more than in 2020, and are more often partnering with friends and family or \"house hacking\" their way to homeownership.\n\nMetropolitan Area* February \r\nZillow Home \r\nValue Index \r\n(ZHVI) \r\n(Raw) ZHVI \r\nChange, \r\nYear over\r\nYear \r\n(YoY) Median \r\nDays to \r\nPending Change in \r\nDays to \r\nPending \r\nvs. Pre-\r\nPandemic \r\nAverage Share of \r\nListings \r\nwith a \r\nPrice Cut Inventory \r\nChange, \r\nYoY New \r\nInventory \r\nChange, \r\nYoY United States $349,216 4.2\u00a0% 17 -10 20.1\u00a0% 12.0\u00a0% 20.8\u00a0% New York, NY $640,486 7.0\u00a0% 26 -31 10.3\u00a0% -14.8\u00a0% 3.7\u00a0% Los Angeles, CA $926,861 8.3\u00a0% 14 -6 14.0\u00a0% -3.1\u00a0% 18.0\u00a0% Chicago, IL $307,944 7.3\u00a0% 9 -16 16.7\u00a0% -4.5\u00a0% 18.1\u00a0% Dallas, TX $372,660 1.3\u00a0% 19 -9 25.9\u00a0% 38.8\u00a0% 50.7\u00a0% Houston, TX $303,824 1.2\u00a0% 28 2 24.5\u00a0% 14.8\u00a0% 23.1\u00a0% Washington, DC $551,667 4.3\u00a0% 6 -17 15.4\u00a0% -6.3\u00a0% 10.9\u00a0% Philadelphia, PA $349,795 7.7\u00a0% 9 -27 17.6\u00a0% -4.7\u00a0% 7.6\u00a0% Miami, FL $479,826 7.5\u00a0% 35 -9 23.8\u00a0% 28.6\u00a0% 31.8\u00a0% Atlanta, GA $377,476 4.4\u00a0% 22 6 22.6\u00a0% 15.5\u00a0% 32.1\u00a0% Boston, MA $668,255 8.8\u00a0% 8 -5 10.7\u00a0% -1.1\u00a0% 13.5\u00a0% Phoenix, AZ $453,327 4.0\u00a0% 20 -7 32.1\u00a0% -10.8\u00a0% 19.0\u00a0% San Francisco, CA $1,130,166 2.5\u00a0% 12 -2 11.7\u00a0% 1.9\u00a0% 19.2\u00a0% Riverside, CA $568,817 6.1\u00a0% 18 -7 18.7\u00a0% -1.0\u00a0% 19.6\u00a0% Detroit, MI $242,648 6.5\u00a0% 11 -11 17.9\u00a0% -3.4\u00a0% 16.2\u00a0% Seattle, WA $721,382 4.4\u00a0% 6 -4 13.9\u00a0% -1.0\u00a0% 32.2\u00a0% Minneapolis, MN $363,973 2.0\u00a0% 19 -2 15.5\u00a0% 22.5\u00a0% 40.4\u00a0% San Diego, CA $930,314 10.8\u00a0% 10 -11 16.8\u00a0% 8.4\u00a0% 22.5\u00a0% Tampa, FL $377,087 3.6\u00a0% 26 2 32.8\u00a0% 30.7\u00a0% 32.6\u00a0% Denver, CO $579,917 1.7\u00a0% 9 2 21.6\u00a0% 9.4\u00a0% 19.6\u00a0% Baltimore, MD $375,866 4.2\u00a0% 7 -29 18.8\u00a0% 2.1\u00a0% 16.3\u00a0% St. Louis, MO $243,550 6.2\u00a0% 7 -16 16.9\u00a0% 9.3\u00a0% 12.7\u00a0% Orlando, FL $393,190 4.1\u00a0% 24 4 25.2\u00a0% 29.5\u00a0% 31.3\u00a0% Charlotte, NC $375,008 4.6\u00a0% 13 19.7\u00a0% 0.1\u00a0% 21.6\u00a0% San Antonio, TX $283,608 -2.5\u00a0% 44 4 27.0\u00a0% 24.7\u00a0% 20.3\u00a0% Portland, OR $538,452 2.3\u00a0% 15 1 19.0\u00a0% 14.7\u00a0% 22.0\u00a0% Sacramento, CA $569,580 3.4\u00a0% 9 -4 17.3\u00a0% -12.4\u00a0% 16.3\u00a0% Pittsburgh, PA $203,573 5.8\u00a0% 12 -40 20.5\u00a0% -0.3\u00a0% 11.6\u00a0% Cincinnati, OH $273,507 6.2\u00a0% 5 -13 19.1\u00a0% 13.7\u00a0% 18.6\u00a0% Austin, TX $456,293 -5.1\u00a0% 40 26 21.3\u00a0% 6.5\u00a0% 37.1\u00a0% Las Vegas, NV $415,400 4.6\u00a0% 17 -9 18.5\u00a0% -22.5\u00a0% 19.0\u00a0% Kansas City, MO $295,389 5.4\u00a0% 6 -13 19.3\u00a0% 15.2\u00a0% 26.3\u00a0% Columbus, OH $304,628 6.3\u00a0% 5 -3 20.7\u00a0% 13.0\u00a0% 15.9\u00a0% Indianapolis, IN $271,674 3.1\u00a0% 12 -12 21.8\u00a0% 13.4\u00a0% 14.0\u00a0% Cleveland, OH $217,511 7.4\u00a0% 9 -40 16.0\u00a0% -5.1\u00a0% 3.1\u00a0% San Jose, CA $1,537,093 8.8\u00a0% 9 -4 8.3\u00a0% 0.3\u00a0% 24.2\u00a0% Nashville, TN $434,361 1.8\u00a0% 21 26.5\u00a0% -1.4\u00a0% 12.3\u00a0% Virginia Beach, VA $340,789 6.0\u00a0% 24 -46 16.6\u00a0% 9.3\u00a0% 14.4\u00a0% Providence, RI $456,902 8.4\u00a0% 9 -25 13.2\u00a0% -4.1\u00a0% 4.0\u00a0% Jacksonville, FL $354,250 1.2\u00a0% 34 -1 26.8\u00a0% 17.9\u00a0% 29.8\u00a0% Milwaukee, WI $330,730 7.5\u00a0% 22 12.2\u00a0% 11.7\u00a0% 12.6\u00a0% Oklahoma City, OK $229,838 3.6\u00a0% 19 -50 23.6\u00a0% 28.4\u00a0% 28.0\u00a0% Raleigh, NC $437,580 3.0\u00a0% 11 3 23.8\u00a0% 4.4\u00a0% 18.0\u00a0% Memphis, TN $235,883 1.4\u00a0% 31 -10 22.0\u00a0% 28.5\u00a0% 24.6\u00a0% Richmond, VA $357,211 5.4\u00a0% 7 -7 17.8\u00a0% 9.1\u00a0% 16.4\u00a0% Louisville, KY $248,361 4.4\u00a0% 9 -14 22.9\u00a0% 11.9\u00a0% 13.9\u00a0% New Orleans, LA $235,804 -7.5\u00a0% 42 4 22.2\u00a0% 23.2\u00a0% 20.5\u00a0% Salt Lake City, UT $533,750 1.6\u00a0% 15 3 20.7\u00a0% 0.0\u00a0% 25.5\u00a0% Hartford, CT $343,635 12.5\u00a0% 6 -27 11.2\u00a0% 2.1\u00a0% 5.5\u00a0% Buffalo, NY $246,490 7.5\u00a0% 11 -17 11.9\u00a0% -9.1\u00a0% 1.6\u00a0% Birmingham, AL $247,914 1.3\u00a0% 14 -5 19.7\u00a0% 10.5\u00a0% 14.9\u00a0%\n\n*Table ordered by market size\n\nAbout Zillow Group: Zillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 20 best US cities to retire with $1 million in retirement savings. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating the financial landscape of the retirement period in the US, you may go to 5 Best US Cities to Retire with $1 Million in Retirement Savings.\n\nThe $1 Million Retirement Myth - and How to Counter It\n\nWhat could you do with $1 million? EquityAtlas says that you could buy a luxury vehicle, secure your own private island, or set out on a world tour.\n\nNow think about $1 million in retirement, and the reality changes. In fact, in many cities in the US, it may become difficult to purchase a home, the reality of which depends on whether you\u2019re living in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. to buy a house. With Redfin Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN) quoting median house prices in the US to be $402,523 as of January 2024 - a 5.2% hike from the previous year - your forever home might just cost you a sizeable 40% of your retirement savings. Of course, some retirees do end up paying less as they search for the most affordable housing markets in the US. Maine and Florida are two of the most popular states to retire to in the US. For these states, median house prices sit at $375,300 and $403,700, respectively, as reported by Redfin Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN). However, what is potentially more concerning is the price hikes that housing in these states underwent - 14.1% for Maine and 4.5% for Florida - since 2023.\n\nIn reality, how long $1 million will last you in retirement depends on the number of years that make up your retirement period. While the age to which a person lives is determined by several factors, including their medical health, their genetics, their fitness routine, and their lifestyle, among others, there are estimates. On average, a 65-year-old retiree can expect to live another 20 years, as reported by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\n$1 million for a 20-year retirement comes out to $50,000 a year - really not very much when you look at it. Sure, at first glance $50,000 seems like a comfortable yearly amount on which to live out your retirement. After all, what is a retiree going to spend $50,000 on? Going a step further, it even comes close to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 $52,141 figure for the average yearly expenses of citizens aged 65 or older. However, envisioning $50,000 to be a luxurious retirement sum is not a very accurate truth. Of the spending figure quoted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the majority is spent on necessities such as housing, groceries, healthcare, and transport. Very little, if any, is left behind for emergencies, home repairs, vacations, and the holiday season. Not to mention, taxation is also a big part of retirement spending depending on where you live.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith how the income and expenses tally, many retirees are left spending their entire Golden period on rent, never actually making it close enough to afford the houses for sale on Redfin Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN), Zillow Group, Inc (NASDAQ:Z), Realtor, and the likes. Of course, rent is not always a much more favorable option and many retirees struggle with the rent burden. Based on data shared by Zillow Group, Inc (NASDAQ:Z), average rent figures for one-bedroom housing in the US is $1,593. Depending on where you retire, though, these figures differ. Average Florida one-bedroom rent, for instance, rises to $1,850, whereas Zillow Group, Inc (NASDAQ:Z) puts California one-bedroom rent at an expensive $2,167.\u00a0 Many others simply run out of savings, left with an empty bank and an uncertain future.\n\nIn order to avoid this, retirees often move - cities, states, countries - whatever suits their boat and their circumstances. They venture out in a bid to find lower costs of living, cheaper rents, and a more favorable housing market.\n\nTo assist present and potential retirees, we have compiled this list of the 20 best US cities to retire with $1 million in retirement savings.  20 Best US Cities to Retire with $1 Million in Retirement Savings\n\nRuslan Guzov/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 20 best US cities to retire with $1 million in retirement savings, we turned to our range of articles on affordable places to retire in the US. Namely, 20 Best Cities to Retire on a Budget of $1,800 a Month, 25 Most Affordable Places to Retire in the U.S. in 2024, 18 Best Southern Cities to Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a Month, and 15 Best East Coast Cities to Retire on a Budget of $1,200 a Month. Once a list of places was compiled using these articles, we shortlisted them on the basis of livability score, keeping only those with a score of 70 and above. For reference, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes. With a list of places in hand, we then turned to Best Places. Here, we gathered the minimum annual income needed by a single person to live comfortably in each of our selected places.\u00a0 We then divided $1 million against this figure, determining the number of years that the said amount in retirement savings would last an individual in each of these cities. The 20 cities with the greatest number of years survived made up our list of best US cities to retire with $1 million in retirement savings. It is crucial to emphasize that the list does not encompass out-of-pocket health expenses and other significant expenditures that a retiree may encounter. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the city guaranteeing the greatest number of years of financial survival being presented last. It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "red and white house for sale sign in front yard of tropical home\n\nHome sellers looking to maximize their sale price may want to avoid the start of the busy spring buying season and list their properties closer to the midpoint of the year, according to a Zillow analysis released Thursday.\n\nIn a study of 2023 home sales, the real estate analytics company found that homes listed in the first two weeks of June sold for 2.3% more than at other times of the year, equating to an additional $7,700 on the typical U.S. home. This differs from 2019 data, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which found that the first two weeks of May were the best time to list a home.\n\nZillow posits that this shift is driven by higher mortgage rates in the post-pandemic era.\n\n\u201cThe old logic was that sellers could earn a premium by listing in late spring when their home would be on the top of the pile of listings when search activity was at its peak,\u201d Zillow chief economist Skylar Olsen said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNow, with persistently low inventory, mortgage rate fluctuations make their own seasonality. First-time home buyers who are on the edge of qualifying for a home loan may dip in and out of the market, depending on what\u2019s happening with rates. It is\u00a0almost certain the Federal Reserve will push back any interest-rate cuts to mid-2024 at the earliest. If mortgage rates follow, that could bring another surge of buyers later this year.\u201d\n\nThe research found that in 30 of the 35 largest U.S. metro areas, homes listed for sale between the start of May and early July 2023 posted the highest sales prices.\n\nBut there were outliers. In San Francisco, for example, the best time to list was in the last two weeks of February, when sales commanded a pricing premium of 4.2%, or an additional $50,300 on the typical home.\n\nOther metro areas where sales prices were maximized prior to the typical May-to-June window included Houston; San Diego; Cincinnati; and Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe premium recorded in June 2023 came on the heels of the first spring in 15 years in which 30-year fixed rates topped 6%. According to HousingWire\u2019s Mortgage Rates Center, the 30-year fixed rate reached 6.83% to end June.\n\nBut there was a slight pullback in rates from May to June, \u201cwhich likely presented an opportunity for determined buyers heading into summer\u201d and led to a boost in competition and sales prices, Zillow reported.",

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Arizona. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Arizona.\n\nDeciding Where To Make Your Retirement Home\n\nRetirement is not just about staying at home - it\u2019s about deciding where to stay at home. According to HireAHelper\u2019s 2023-2024 Moving Migration Report, 2023 was a historic year for migration trends. A mere 7.8% of Americans moved states, the lowest ever number since the 1948 US Census when US migration trends were first recorded.\n\nDespite these faltering numbers, retirement moves were on the rise. Compared to 2022, 2023 saw a 44.4% rise in retirement moves. There\u2019s a host of reasons why American retirees are changing destinations as they enter the golden years of their lives. According to United Van Lines, some of the top reasons why retirees move are to seek a lower cost of living and warmer weather.\n\nWhile moving may not seem like the ideal retiree choice - after all, it\u2019s not an easy process - there are steps that senior citizens can take to make the move easier. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) lists a number of helpful tips for seniors on the move. This includes decluttering, finding friends and family to help, and taking the assistance of moving companies. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) itself operates in all 50 American states and can help senior citizens in packing, loading, unloading, and cleaning up. Not only this, but U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) also offers a U-Box container service that provides direct delivery to the senior citizen\u2019s new home.\n\nFor retirees who do choose to move, there are certain trends. According to AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), the top five states that American retirees are moving to are Florida, South Carolina, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington, in order of likelihood. While these may be the most popular choices, American retiree migration trends are much more varied. Arizona, for instance, is another state which attracts retirees.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou might be wondering, is Arizona a retirement friendly state? Well, the state experiences a favorable climate with hot summers and mild winters, perfect for retirees who may want to avoid the nuisance of extremely chilly weather. Arizona also offers good healthcare - the state received a number 24 healthcare rank according to U.S. News & World Report. This combined with the many stunning natural landscapes and mix of indoor and outdoor activities that the state holds make it a great pick for a retiree on the move.\n\nThat being said, there are destinations to navigate within the state. Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) puts the median house price for Arizona at $433,500 - a figure that presents itself to be out of reach for many retirees. As for rent, Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) puts the average monthly charge at $1,305 for one-bedroom rentals. While these numbers may not seem daunting to some, to others - especially Social Security retirees - they can be quite burdensome. Of course, both Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) and Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) list more affordable options - but knowing which places to look at certainly helps.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Arizona state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Arizona.  15 Best Places to Retire in Arizona\n\nCopyright: halfpoint / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Arizona, we consulted several sources including NewHomeSource, Niche, MoneyTalksNews, GOBankingRates, AZAnimals, The Travel, and World Population Review. Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their cost of living, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, cost of living indices were taken from Best Places, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN). A cumulative score was then assigned to each place, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Arizona.\n\nFor cities that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last. It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Indeed, housing affordability has gotten so bad that prospective buyers need to make about $50,000 more now than pre-pandemic in order to \u201ccomfortably\u201d afford a home, according to a Zillow report released Thursday. And affording a home goes beyond monthly mortgage payments, experts agree.\n\n\"Comfortably affording a home in today's market means having the financial capacity to cover mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and other associated costs without significant financial strain,\u201d Stacy Brown, director of technical training at Real Property Management, tells Fortune.

Monthly mortgage payments on a \u201ctypical home,\u201d which Zillow defines as costing $343,000, have nearly doubled in that time frame to $2,188, assuming a 10% down payment. And while mortgage rates and home prices are the main culprits behind today\u2019s housing affordability challenges, there are other factors that make buying a home more costly.\n\nMortgage rates and home prices don\u2019t tell the whole story\n\nSince January 2020, home values have jumped nearly 43%, according to Zillow. In 2023 alone, home prices increased nearly 6%, according to the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (a real estate industry standard measure). Meanwhile, mortgage rates ended January 2020 at about 3.5%, half of today\u2019s 30-year fixed mortgage rate of 7.1%, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile looking at mortgage rates and home prices alone is dire enough, wages also haven\u2019t kept up with the demands of a home purchase. A household earning a $59,000 salary in 2020 could comfortably afford the monthly mortgage, meaning they wouldn\u2019t spend more than 30% of their income with a 10% down payment, according to Zillow. That was below the U.S. median income at the time, which clocked in at about $66,000, \u201cmeaning more than half of American households had the financial means to afford homeownership,\u201d Anushna Prakash, a Zillow economic analyst, wrote in the report.\n\n\u201cA significant portion of Americans struggle to afford homeownership, especially in younger age groups and individuals with lower incomes,\u201d Jaclyn Anastasakos, a real estate agent with Luxe Properties in Miami, tells Fortune. \u201cThe gap between income levels and housing costs has widened, making it harder for many to achieve the dream of owning a home.\u201d\n\nNow, the U.S. median income is $81,000, according to Zillow, but prospective homeowners need more than $106,000 to \u201ccomfortably\u201d purchase a home. That means that wages haven\u2019t kept pace with home prices, mortgage rates, and other costs associated with buying a house in the U.S. Filippo Incorvaia, owner and broker at Miami-based FI Real Estate, says housing affordability \u201cfeels the most intense\u201d since he started his career 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cSix figure incomes are essential to affording a home today,\u201d Incorvaia tells Fortune. \u201cThis usually means both partners are typically working and contributing, and you could still be strained financially. Meanwhile, purchasing a property alone is more challenging than ever.\u201d\n\nAnd certain housing markets\u2014particularly large metropolitan areas\u2014that have high demand and limited supply \u201cmay require an even higher income to afford a home,\u201d Brown says.\n\n\u201cEven in areas that have typically been affordable, those neighborhoods considered affluent or renovated continue to command higher home prices,\u201d Brown says. \u201cCouple that with major employers moving operations to states with more favorable taxes or other incentives, [and] many areas that were considered affordable are quickly becoming out of reach for many.\u201d\n\nHouse hacking\n\nIncorvaia finds that many people in their 20s are \u201cdelaying the dream of homeownership entirely\u201d because housing affordability has gotten so strained. The majority of his first-time homebuyers are professionals in their 30s and 40s who have been focused on their career while renting and saving for a down payment.\n\nWith fewer individuals\u2014and even couples\u2014able to purchase a home, many Gen Zers and millennials have turned to \u201chouse hacking,\u201d or co-buying with friends or family. They then rent out all or part of these properties in order to generate extra income. Zillow reports that 21% of last year\u2019s buyers did this. While this might seem like a good idea in the interim as mortgage payments stay high, house hacking has its downsides.\n\n\u201cHouse hacking is a real phenomenon,\u201d Incorvaia says. \u201cFriends and multiple couples choose to purchase a property together to reduce costs, but this also reduces equity and may not be the most viable long term solution.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The income needed to comfortably afford a home in the US has leapt 80% since 2020, far exceeding a 23% increase in median income over the same period, according to a post on Thursday by Zillow.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFed\u2019s Preferred Inflation Metric Increases by Most in a Year How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Stocks End Month at New Highs After Inflation Data: Markets Wrap Trump Warns of Big Losses From Asset Sales During Property Slump Apple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey\n\nThe real estate website found home buyers today need to make more than $106,000 a year, up $47,000 from 2020, a change driven largely by higher prices and borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cHousing costs have soared over the past four years as drastic hikes in home prices, mortgage rates and rent growth far outpaced wage gains,\u201d said Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow.\n\nIn 2020, a household earning $59,000 a year could comfortably afford the monthly mortgage on a typical US home, assuming the general rule of thumb that a buyer can spend up to 30% of their income on housing and make a 10% down payment.\n\nThat was less than the US median income of about $66,000 at the time, meaning more than half of American households had the financial means to afford homeownership.\n\nToday it takes roughly $106,500 in income to afford a typical home, and median earnings are about $81,000, putting a home purchase out of reach for most families.\n\nA model created by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta similarly shows US homes, on average, fell below an affordability threshold in May 2021 and have remained there since. The Fed\u2019s Home Ownership Affordability Monitor Index measures the ability of a median-income household to absorb the estimated annual costs of owning a median-priced home. The model, which incorporates nearly 20 years of data, found houses are in their longest stretch below the threshold since 2009.\n\nThe Zillow study, meanwhile, showed the monthly mortgage payment on a typical home has nearly doubled since January 2020, to $2,188 (assuming a 10% down payment), according to the report. Mortgage rates have eased in recent months as investors expect the Federal Reserve to begin cutting their benchmark interest rate this year.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cMortgage rates easing down has helped some, but the key to improving affordability long term is to build more homes,\u201d Divounguy said.\n\nIn 14 large housing markets, led by a handful of cities in California, Zillow estimated that household income must be $150,000 or more to comfortably afford a typical home. Among the 50 largest metropolitan areas studied, only Pittsburgh still had an income threshold for affordability below the $59,000 national average from 2020.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Elon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience There\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best real estate stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the real estate industry, head over to 5 Best Real Estate Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe global real estate market is grappling with challenges such as inflation, potential recession risks, and geopolitical uncertainties. The efforts of central banks to curb inflation are gradually proving effective, giving rise to a prevailing sentiment that interest rates may have reached their peak. Nevertheless, the lingering impact of recent policies introduces uncertainty, and economic growth is expected to moderate in 2024. Despite the anticipation of a soft landing, the resilience of many economies globally suggests that policy rates will likely remain elevated well into 2024. Lagged effects from monetary tightening, coupled with geopolitical instability and election uncertainties in major economies, pose additional potential risks to the real estate outlook.\n\nAccording to Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL), a prominent real estate firm, inflation is subsiding in major economies, providing increased predictability in consumer and producer prices, including construction costs. The pandemic-related disruptions, including shifts in consumer shopping habits, international trade, and e-commerce, have largely settled. As a result, logistics demand is aligning more closely with historical growth trends. Office utilization has improved globally, particularly in Asia and parts of Europe, and the United States is witnessing a gradual return to office mandates. This return is expected to increase incrementally in 2024, revitalizing Central Business Districts (CBDs) with renewed daytime foot traffic and retail demand.\n\nOpportunities for growth exist in specific sectors and geographical micro-markets. Distress and portfolio rebalancing efforts present opportunities for investors. JLL observed that the Living sectors, driven by an expanding world population and long-term structural trends, are expected to remain a bright spot in 2024 and beyond. The emphasis on regionalization and local manufacturing is set to continue, with the evolving global landscape of government incentives driving demand for industrial and logistics facilities. Retail is poised for a comeback in 2024, with investors returning to a sector that has transformed its dynamics to offer attractive returns and renewed rental growth. In the data center market, the global forecast points to rapid growth, driven by the evolving adoption of artificial intelligence. For real estate occupiers, 2024 is a year to solidify workplace policies, align portfolio strategies with new ways of working, and upgrade existing facilities. Focus on sustainability is intensifying, with many companies linking their future building demand to carbon commitments. The demand for low carbon workspace is expected to outstrip existing stock and the current development pipeline by 2030, presenting opportunities for sustainable building owners and developers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the next 12 to 18 months, the real estate industry will undergo a transformative period where firms are expected to reposition themselves. Deloitte's 2024 Real Estate Outlooksurvey, based on insights from 750 CFOs and their direct reports in major real estate firms across 11 countries, sheds light on the challenges and strategies in the global real estate landscape. Key findings from the survey indicate that concerns about the economy will significantly influence real estate decision-making. Revenue expectations have declined for two consecutive years, and to address this, real estate CFOs are planning further expense reductions, particularly in talent and office space. Expectations for the real estate property sector's fundamental conditions are the most negative since 2018. Worsening leasing fundamentals, including vacancies, leasing activities, and rental growth, are anticipated over the next 12 to 18 months. Respondents believe real estate capital markets may be approaching a market bottom, with expectations of worsening property pricing and transaction activity. Amid these challenges, property sector targets are shifting. Digital economy properties, such as data centers and cell towers, are seen as the most attractive risk-adjusted opportunity globally. Alternative sectors, including single-family rentals, build-to-rents, senior care, and life sciences, have gained ground in respondents' preferences, while traditional sectors like downtown and suburban offices have dropped in attractiveness.\n\nAgainst a mixed landscape in the real estate sector, some of the best stocks to buy for beginners include Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE), and CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database of 933 hedge funds and picked 11 companies operating in the real estate services industry with the highest number of hedge funds. We refrained from picking REITs for this list. These are the best real estate stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Anywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nAnywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS) is a residential real estate services company operating globally through three segments \u2013 Anywhere Brands, Anywhere Advisors, and Anywhere Integrated Services. The company franchises well-known brands, operates a full-service brokerage business, and provides title, escrow, settlement, and mortgage lending services. While Anywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS) remains a popular real estate play among smart investors, the company missed revenue and EPS estimates in Q4 2023.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 22 hedge funds were long Anywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS), compared to 21 funds in the last quarter. Angelo Gordon & Co is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 9.7 million shares valued at $78.6 million.\n\nLike Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE), and CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP), Anywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS) is one of the best real estate stocks for beginners.\n\nLongleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund made the following comment about Anywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAnywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS) \u2013 Real Estate brokerage franchisor Anywhere was another solid performer in the quarter and for the first half, benefitting from \u201cgreen shoots\u201d in the seemingly bottomed-out US housing market. Management has maintained strong cost control, and even at this depressed level, Anywhere is producing net positive free cash flow (FCF) today with the potential for strong future franchise fee growth.\u201d\n\n10. Newmark Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NMRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\n\nNewmark Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NMRK) offers commercial real estate services globally, catering to both investors/owners and occupiers. The company provides capital markets services, including investment, debt, and structured finance, as well as agency leasing, property management, and valuation. Newmark Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NMRK) is one of the best stock ideas when it comes to real estate investing for beginners.\n\nOn February 22, Newmark Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NMRK) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, missing market estimates by $0.01. The revenue increased 23.1% year-over-year to $747.4 million, exceeding Wall Street expectations by $3.87 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 24 hedge funds were bullish on Newmark Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NMRK), compared to 16 funds in the prior quarter. Empyrean Capital Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 4.36 million shares worth $47.8 million.\n\nHere is what O\u2019Keefe Stevens Advisory has to say about Newmark Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NMRK) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOn 12/30/2021, at 4:04 pm, NMRK put out a press release saying, \u201cOn December 28, 2021, Newmark Group, Inc. awarded to Howard W. Lutnick, the Company\u2019s Chairman and principal executive officer, a one-time $50 million bonus award (the \u201cLutnick Award\u201d) in consideration of his efforts in delivering superior financial results. These efforts included his management of the company and success in creating value for the company\u2019s stockholders in connection with structuring, hedging, and monetizing the Nasdaq, Inc. common stock (the \u201cNasdaq Shares\u201d) held by the company and the significant amount of income earned by the company related to these activities and the significant increase in value of such Nasdaq Shares over time.\n\nIn 2013, BGCP sold their ESpeed trading platform to Nasdaq for $750m in cash and ~1m shares of NDAQ stock per year for 15 years. A clause in the sale agreement stated if Nasdaq were to sell the ESpeed platform, the remaining shares would immediately be granted to BGCP. In 2018 Newmark was spun-off from BGCP and was given the remaining shares of NDAQ to be received. In 2021, Nasdaq sold ESpeed to Tradeweb. Instead of receiving 1 million shares of NDAQ for the next seven years, they received ~7m shares at once. As mentioned above, hedging instruments were used; nonetheless, it was a significant windfall for NMRK.\n\nA retroactive, one-time bonus was given to Howard because of the transaction. To clarify, NMRK\u2019s Board of Directors gave Howard a bonus because Nasdaq sold the Espeed platform. Howard was not a part of the conversation between Nasdaq and Tradeweb and undoubtedly did not influence the transaction. $50m was approximately 1.3% of the market cap of NMRK at the time, and the value of the NDAQ stock received was ~$650m after taxes and forward agreements were settled. Roughly 8% of that value was given to Howard. When the original Espeed sale to Nasdaq occurred, NDAQ stock was trading in the $30\u2019s, putting the original value of the shares to be received in the $450-500m range. From 2014-to 2021, NDAQ\u2019s stock rose from $40 to $200. Did Howard have anything to do with this price appreciation? I think not. Did Espeed lead to value creation for NDAQ shareholders and potentially a source for the stock appreciation? Nasdaq paid $750m in cash + 15m shares of NDAQ and subsequently sold ESpeed to Tradeweb for $190m. Howard deserves some credit because he clearly got a phenomenal price for ESpeed\u2026'\u201d (Click here to see the full text)\n\n9. Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 25\n\nJones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) is a global commercial real estate and investment management company. It engages in buying, building, managing, and investing in properties worldwide. Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) offers a range of real estate services, including leasing, property management, advisory, and capital market services. It is one of the best plays in real estate investing for beginners.\n\nOn February 7, Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.23 and a revenue of $5.9 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.50 and $110 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 25 hedge funds held stakes in Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL), compared to 24 funds in the prior quarter. David Blood and Al Gore\u2019s Generation Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 4.20 million shares worth $794 million.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur other real estate-related opportunities category includes three investment themes and various companies that do not fit neatly in our traditional REIT, residential-related real estate, and travel-related real estate categories. They currently include three investment themes: Commercial real estate services companies Examples: CBRE Group, Inc. and Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL).\n\nWe remain bullish on the long-term growth opportunity for the commercial real estate brokerage category because of structural and secular tailwinds that should benefit leading global companies such as CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nTailwinds include: \u2022 The outsourcing of commercial real estate: A growing number of companies are increasingly looking to outsource their commercial real estate needs. CBRE estimates that the overall facilities management market will be $1.9 trillion in 2024, representing a massive growth opportunity for large global commercial real estate services companies. \u2022 The institutionalization of commercial real estate: Institutional allocations to real estate continue to increase, in part due to real estate\u2019s diversification, inflation protection, and stable long-term growth attributes. \u2022 Opportunities to increase market share: The commercial real estate industry remains highly fragmented and is likely to continue to consolidate. Customers tend to prefer commercial real estate companies that can provide a broad set of services. We believe CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle are best positioned to drive market share gains given that they are the clear #1 and #2 commercial real estate services firms, respectively, and they have the capability to provide the full array of real estate offerings on a global scale.\n\nCBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle have scale, product breadth, and leadership positions across their diversified real estate business segments. They continue to gain market share and are well positioned to capitalize on ample attractive acquisition opportunities in the years ahead given strong and liquid balance sheets. Though growth in certain segments of their businesses has slowed and is likely to remain under pressure in the months ahead due to the global economic slowdown, higher interest rates, and the likelihood of more restrictive bank lending, we believe both are attractively valued and present compelling return potential over the next few years.\u201d\n\n8. Compass, Inc. (NYSE:COMP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\n\nCompass, Inc. (NYSE:COMP) is an American real estate brokerage services provider. The company operates a cloud-based platform with integrated software for real estate functions, including customer relationship management, marketing, client service, and operations. It is one of the best real estate investing ideas for beginners.\n\nOn February 27, Compass, Inc. (NYSE:COMP) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of -$0.17, beating market consensus by $0.02. The revenue of $1.10 billion, however, fell short of Wall Street estimates by $30 million. The company expects to be free cash flow positive for the full year 2024.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, Compass, Inc. (NYSE:COMP) was part of 26 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 19 in the last quarter. Richard Mashaal\u2019s Rima Senvest Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.78 million shares worth $33 million.\n\nHere is what Artisan Small Cap Fund has to say about Compass, Inc. (NYSE:COMP) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added several new GardenSM positions in Q3 including Compass. Compass is a real estate brokerage firm which provides its agents with a proprietary, end-to-end cloud-based platform. The company helps address the needs of buying and selling homes from client prospecting to closing, which includes customer relationship management, AI-driven prospecting, marketing (digital, social, email, video, print, signage, lead generation), market analysis and collaboration tools. The platform also uses machine learning, artificial intelligence and other advanced data analytics strategies to draw insights across the platform, allowing agents to be more efficient and informed in their selling efforts. We believe this technology advantage is key to the company continuing to disrupt and capture real estate commission market share. We have been impressed with the company\u2019s ability to capture 4% market share since it was founded in 2012 (vs. Redfin, founded in 2002, holding a 1% market share). The company\u2019s profit cycle can also be boosted by adding on additional services such as title insurance referral and escrow services, real estate marketing, home renovation referrals, home insurance and home warranty referrals\u2014all of which we believe have a significantly larger addressable market than commissions (~7X).\u201d\n\n7. Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\n\nRedfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) ranks 7th on our list of the best real estate stocks for beginners. It is a residential real estate brokerage company operating in the United States and Canada. The company functions through an online real estate marketplace, offering services to assist individuals in buying or selling homes. Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN)\u2019s total revenue for Q1 2024 is estimated to be in the range of $214 million to $223 million. Real estate services revenue is expected to be between $126 million and $131 million, rentals revenue between $49 million and $50 million, mortgage revenue between $29 million and $32 million, and other revenue between $9 million and $10 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 26 hedge funds were long Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), compared to 21 funds in the prior quarter. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace\u2019s Marshall Wace LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.3 million shares worth $34 million.\n\nSaga Partners made the following comment about Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cRedfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN)\u2019s results have been disappointing in 2022. Aside from the COVID lockdown quarter of Q2\u201920, Redfin never experienced a year-over-year decline in transaction volume. In fact, the company has never grown transaction volume less than double digits.\n\nThe housing market has been difficult to navigate since COVID. Recent volatility in existing home sales is not what one would expect from normal cyclicality but has been due to the imbalances in supply/demand since COVID, combined with higher interest rates. Housing is unique in that most home buyers are also home sellers. Since rates moved up significantly in 2022, homeowners that refinanced at lower rates are less willing to buy a new home, at least at current prices, which has led to standstill in existing home transactions\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6.Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\n\nHoward Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH) owns, manages, and develops commercial, residential, and mixed-use properties in the United States. The company operates through four segments \u2013 Operating Assets, Master Planned Communities (MPCs), Seaport, and Strategic Developments. On February 27, Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.69 and a revenue of $335.8 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.65 and $31.8 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 27 hedge funds held stakes in Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH), compared to 20 funds in the earlier quarter.\n\nIn addition to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE), and CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP), Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH) is one of the best stocks when it comes to real estate investing for beginners. It ranks 6th on our list.\n\nPershing Square Holdings made the following comment about Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH) in its first half 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cHoward Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH)\u2019s high-quality collection of well-located master planned communities (\u201cMPC\u201d) delivered resilient performance in the first half of 2023 led by a strong recovery in the housing market and robust leasing momentum in the company\u2019s income producing operating assets.\n\nMortgage interest rates have stabilized this year after rapidly rising in 2022. The supply of home resale inventory remains constrained as homeowners are reluctant to sell their existing homes and incur more expensive mortgages. As a result, there has been a resurgence in demand for newly built homes. Amidst that backdrop, the relative affordability of HHH\u2019s MPCs, which are located in low cost-of-living and low-tax states like Texas and Nevada, remains highly appealing to prospective homebuyers. New home sales in HHH\u2019s MPCs increased 11% year-over-year in the first half of 2023, reflecting strong demand for future land sales and causing the company to raise its guidance for full-year 2023 MPC land sale profits by 20%.\n\nIn HHH\u2019s income-producing operating assets, net operating income (\u201cNOI\u201d) grew 6% on a same-store basis during the first half of the year driven by improving leasing velocity and strong rental rate growth. The company\u2019s office portfolio is benefiting from a \u201cflight to quality\u201d as companies and their employees are drawn to the desirability of HHH\u2019s walkable and amenity-rich MPCs. Likewise, in the company\u2019s condominium development at Ward Village, Hawaii, HHH continues to experience durable sales momentum with its latest condo tower already 83% pre-sold within nine months of its launch. In the most recent quarter, the company contracted to sell 43 units, representing an impressive 27% of available unit inventory. At its Seaport development in New York City, the company is focused on driving operational improvements at the recently opened Tin Building food hall, which continues to generate operating losses in its first full year of operations.\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nClick to continue reading and see\u00a05 Best Real Estate Stocks To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett Top 20 Most Valuable Tobacco Companies in the World 11 Best Brewery and Distillery Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a0Real Estate Investing For Beginners: 11 Best Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 17 safest places to retire abroad for less than $3,000 a month. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on establishing a retirement living overseas, you may go to 5 Safest Places to Retire Abroad for Less Than $3,000 a Month.\n\nThe Demands and Requirements of a Retirement Abroad\n\nUpwards of $10,000. That\u2019s not the cost of a year at college or a year\u2019s worth of rent. According to BuzzFeed Inc. (NASDAQ:BZFD) owned Huffpost, it\u2019s the estimated cost of moving abroad. The BuzzFeed Inc. (NASDAQ:BZFD) backed publication details this figure to include the cost of overseas shipping, securing visas, setting up your documents and finances - such as your driver\u2019s license and money wires from the US - housing, insurance, air travel, and a whole host of other things.\n\nWith a $10,000 - or larger - investment on the line, you might think that the number of Americans moving abroad is in the smaller pools. However, these one-time costs don\u2019t seem to have deterred US citizens, presumably as they pale in contrast to the benefits of some of the best countries to relocate to. The Association of American Residents Overseas estimates that a minimum of 5.4 million Americans live beyond the States as of 2023. A good portion of them are retirees.\n\nWhile a vacation abroad may seem magical, permanently moving to another country can certainly be daunting. So then why do so many American citizens - the Wall Street Journal, a division of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS), reported that as many as 450,000 retirees received their social security benefits in foreign countries - retire abroad? With this News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) number already presumed to have grown, the reasons are multi fold.\n\nGenerally speaking, retirees are keen on peaceful, safe living. In many cases, they\u2019re also one for living life on a budget, often finding cheap things to do in retirement. While patriots may point out the many wonderful things that the US has to offer, making an argument over how safe it is easily falls short. In a safe countries survey conducted by U.S. News and World Report, the US missed the top 10 - and 20 and 30 - mark, coming in at number 46 out of a total of 87 countries. Instead, it was mainly the European continent that triumphed. Similarly, the US received a disappointing 131st position on the recent Global Peace Index, reported the Miami Herald.\n\nStory continues\n\nThings are not much better on the financial side either. For retirees spending their days living on Social Security check to Social Security check, their monthly budget comes out to a mere $1,909 based on the Social Security Administration\u2019s Social Security payout for 2024. With average rental numbers at $1,568 for one-bedroom apartments in the US according to Zillow Inc (NASDAQ:Z), this doesn\u2019t leave much behind for utilities, groceries, healthcare, travel, and the like. Of course, Zillow Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) also lists cheaper rental options - such as average one-bedroom rent being $850 for Iowa City and $725 for West Virginia - these cheaper options often come with problems of their own and are not accessible to everyone.\n\nAs such, the thought process behind the retiree's decision to spend their Golden Years abroad suddenly becomes clear.\n\nTo assist senior citizens in the move abroad, we have compiled the following list of the safest places to retire abroad for less than $3,000 a month.  17 Safest Places to Retire Abroad for Less Than $3,000 a Month\n\nMalgorzata Drewniak/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 17 safest places to retire abroad for less than $3,000 a month, we consulted several sources including our lists of 15 Cheapest and Safest Countries to Retire In and 25 Best Cities Where You Can Retire On $3,000 A Month, and Nomad Capitalist, Live and Invest Overseas, U.S. News and World Report, and Global Citizen Solutions. Once a list of countries was shortlisted using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, the Institute for Economics and Peace\u2019s Global Peace Index, the Environmental Performance Index, their average cost of living, and their average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment. For the cost of living and rent, multiple sources were consulted, including expat opinions on forums such as Reddit and Quora. Whereas for the Global Peace Index, countries with a rank of below 80 were removed.\n\nAs the safety of a country is determined both by how peaceful it is and by how healthy its environment is, we have included the Environmental Performance Index to provide a holistic picture. For this index, a score of 100 depicts a perfect score. Each country was then awarded a cumulative score, with the highest-scoring country being awarded the number one rank. For countries that gained an equal score, their Global Peace Index ranking was used as a tie-breaker. Since we based research on a country basis due to many indices only being available at the country level, we then selected a specific city or town for each of our finalized 17 countries. The selection process for each city included consulting several sources, such as articles, public forums, and ranking lists, with the criteria of \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018affordable\u2019 being used. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last. It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Gap between Black and white renting families who could afford a mortgage narrowed significantly during the pandemic",
        "content": "Study underscores that factors not related to income are keeping the Black-white homeownership gap wide\n\nRacial mortgage affordability gap shrunk by more than a third since 2012 Among all races, renting families able to afford a mortgage dropped by nearly half from 2021 to 2022 White households own homes at a 73% rate, while Black households own at 44%, with over half of the top 50 metros showing a gap of 30 points or more\n\nSEATTLE, Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The gap between the share of Black and white renting families that could comfortably afford a mortgage payment shrunk significantly during the pandemic, a new Zillow\u00ae report shows. Despite this progress, a notable homeownership gap and disproportionate rate of mortgage denials persists, suggesting that other barriers not related to income are also impeding Black families' access to homeownership. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\nIn 2022, approximately 38.6% of 138 million U.S. families1 were not homeowners, according to the American Community Survey. Among those, more than 6.3 million families were considered \"income mortgage-ready,\"2 meaning their income would allow for paying a typical mortgage payment in their area without being cost burdened.\n\nAbout 7.8% of Black non-home owning families were income-ready for a mortgage, compared to 12.5% of white families \u2014 a gap of 4.7 percentage points. While significant, the gap shrunk by more than one-third since 2012, when it stood at 7.9 percentage points.\n\n\"Despite the significant decline in mortgage affordability in the past two years, millions of families who do not own their home have the means to afford the largest share of a homeowner's cost \u2014 the mortgage,\" said Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy. \"While some families may choose to rent, many are simply constrained. It's crucial to recognize the existence of additional barriers beyond monthly cost, including access to funds for a down payment and closing costs \u2014 as well as other barriers that significantly contribute to mortgage denials, like insufficient credit scores and lack of access to credit. These barriers especially impact people of color.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, among all races, the number of renting families able to afford a mortgage dropped to 6.3 million in 2022 from 12.9 million in 2021, as mortgage rates doubled. While higher mortgage rates and higher prices affected everyone, the median family income of renters rose more for Blacks than for whites since 2012. Regions where Black family incomes rose most generally experienced a greater decline in the racial mortgage readiness gap during the 2012 to 2022 period.\n\nDetroit has the highest share (13.3%) of Black renting families earning enough income to comfortably afford a mortgage, followed by Memphis (12.8%), St. Louis (12.0%), Houston (11.6%) and Cleveland (11.2%). While home values are relatively lower in those communities and more Black families could afford the typical mortgage payment, access to homeownership remains a challenge.\n\nRacial disparities in home values, homeownership rates and credit security Even though the incomes of Black renting families rose faster during the pandemic, significant disparities persist in homeownership rates and home values between Black and white Americans. Nationally, white households owned homes at a much higher rate (73%) than Black households (44%), and the gap exceeded 30 percentage points in more than half of the country's 50 largest metros in 2022.\n\nCompounding the issue, the typical home owned by a white family is still worth far more than the typical home owned by a Black family. Although there has been incremental progress in narrowing the home value gap, it still exceeds 10 percentage points in 42 of the top 50 metro areas.\n\nDiscriminatory lending practices and higher denial rates for Black mortgage applicants, compounded by credit history issues, also pose challenges to housing equity. In 2022, Black applicants saw a 146% higher mortgage loan denial rate compared to white applicants, potentially hindering future generational wealth transfer. Credit history is the most common reason cited for these denials.\n\nInitiatives aimed at things like enhancing access to down payment assistance andcredit-building opportunities as well as implementing reforms in zoning, together with efforts to construct and preserve affordable housing in thriving communities, are vital.\n\nHousing Inequalities by Race\n\nTop 50 metros Share of Black Families \r\nThat Can Afford the Typical \r\nMortgage \r\nWithout Cost Burden\n\n(non owners) Share of White Families \r\nThat Can Afford the \r\nTypical Mortgage \r\nWithout Cost Burden\n\n(non owners) Share of Families \r\nThat Can Afford the \r\nTypical\u00a0 Mortgage \r\nWithout Cost Burden \r\n(overall; all races) Typical Home \r\nValue Gap: \r\nWhite vs. Black \r\nHouseholds\n\n(in percentage points) Homeownership Gap: \r\nWhite vs. Black \r\nHouseholds\n\n(in percentage points)  United States 7.8\u00a0% 12.5\u00a0% 11.9\u00a0% 17.9 pp  28.9 pp New York, NY 2.6\u00a0% 11.5\u00a0% 6.9\u00a0% 15.7 pp 33.0 pp Los Angeles, CA 1.1\u00a0% 4.2\u00a0% 2.1\u00a0% 30.8 pp 25.7 pp Chicago, IL 8.3\u00a0% 21.9\u00a0% 16.3\u00a0% 39.4 pp 33.5 pp Dallas, TX 6.5\u00a0% 13.5\u00a0% 10.6\u00a0% 22.5 pp 30.2 pp Houston, TX 11.6\u00a0% 19.3\u00a0% 13.7\u00a0% 22.9 pp 29.2 pp Washington, DC 6.2\u00a0% 12.8\u00a0% 9.1\u00a0% 9.6 pp 19.1 pp Philadelphia, PA 7.3\u00a0% 15.2\u00a0% 12.8\u00a0% 28.3 pp 27.1 pp Miami, FL 4.7\u00a0% 13.1\u00a0% 7.2\u00a0% 22.2 pp 27.2 pp Atlanta, GA 8.1\u00a0% 12.0\u00a0% 10.1\u00a0% 17.7 pp 24.3 pp Boston, MA 2.8\u00a0% 5.4\u00a0% 4.8\u00a0% 18.1 pp 31.3 pp Phoenix, AZ 4.2\u00a0% 5.5\u00a0% 4.4\u00a0% 14.2 pp 33.7 pp San Francisco, CA 0.3\u00a0% 4.2\u00a0% 2.5\u00a0% 29.2 pp 29.2 pp Riverside, CA 4.4\u00a0% 3.8\u00a0% 3.5\u00a0% 1.2 pp 30.6 pp Detroit, MI 13.3\u00a0% 19.6\u00a0% 18.6\u00a0% 45.4 pp 34.0 pp Seattle, WA 2.3\u00a0% 4.5\u00a0% 4.5\u00a0% 16.7 pp 34.3 pp Minneapolis, MN 7.1\u00a0% 7.8\u00a0% 7.7\u00a0% 14.0 pp 46.0 pp San Diego, CA 1.7\u00a0% 2.1\u00a0% 1.8\u00a0% 24.4 pp 32.3 pp Tampa, FL 5.4\u00a0% 10.6\u00a0% 9.2\u00a0% 11.3 pp 27.0 pp Denver, CO 1.3\u00a0% 4.2\u00a0% 3.6\u00a0% 12.7 pp 26.0 pp Baltimore, MD 10.0\u00a0% 13.4\u00a0% 12.1\u00a0% 16.9 pp 30.8 pp St. Louis, MO 12.0\u00a0% 17.6\u00a0% 17.3\u00a0% 44.7 pp 32.9 pp Orlando, FL 6.3\u00a0% 10.0\u00a0% 7.6\u00a0% 13.2 pp 24.4 pp Charlotte, NC 7.0\u00a0% 12.6\u00a0% 10.2\u00a0% 18.2 pp 31.5 pp San Antonio, TX 4.9\u00a0% 16.6\u00a0% 10.1\u00a0% 10.5 pp 28.0 pp Portland, OR 2.8\u00a0% 3.1\u00a0% 3.1\u00a0% 3.7 pp 38.9 pp Sacramento, CA 2.1\u00a0% 3.8\u00a0% 3.2\u00a0% 5.8 pp 28.5 pp Pittsburgh, PA 10.9\u00a0% 20.1\u00a0% 19.7\u00a0% 26.6 pp 39.9 pp Cincinnati, OH 6.8\u00a0% 13.4\u00a0% 12.8\u00a0% 18.9 pp 39.5 pp Austin, TX 6.4\u00a0% 6.3\u00a0% 5.5\u00a0% 22.0 pp 23.9 pp Las Vegas, NV 3.6\u00a0% 7.5\u00a0% 5.4\u00a0% 5.1 pp 34.0 pp Kansas City, MO 7.9\u00a0% 15.7\u00a0% 13.6\u00a0% 25.1 pp 32.5 pp Columbus, OH 10.7\u00a0% 13.6\u00a0% 12.9\u00a0% 20.6 pp 36.2 pp Indianapolis, IN 9.9\u00a0% 16.4\u00a0% 14.6\u00a0% 9.4 pp 33.3 pp Cleveland, OH 11.2\u00a0% 23.8\u00a0% 19.1\u00a0% 40.6 pp 36.0 pp San Jose, CA 0.0\u00a0% 3.5\u00a0% 1.9\u00a0% 17.6 pp 33.9 pp Nashville, TN 3.0\u00a0% 7.3\u00a0% 6.3\u00a0% 14.4 pp 27.6 pp Virginia Beach, VA 7.9\u00a0% 13.4\u00a0% 10.2\u00a0% 7.1 pp 27.9 pp Providence, RI 2.3\u00a0% 5.1\u00a0% 4.8\u00a0% 10.1 pp 26.0 pp Jacksonville, FL 9.5\u00a0% 9.9\u00a0% 9.9\u00a0% 21.1pp 27.2pp Milwaukee, WI 5.3\u00a0% 12.5\u00a0% 10.4\u00a0% 38.2 pp 43.9 pp Oklahoma City, OK 10.1\u00a0% 17.0\u00a0% 15.6\u00a0% 19.3 pp 33.9 pp Raleigh, NC 3.5\u00a0% 8.1\u00a0% 6.6\u00a0% 15.5 pp 24.9 pp Memphis, TN 12.8\u00a0% 20.8\u00a0% 16.2\u00a0% 32.7 pp 31.2 pp Richmond, VA 9.0\u00a0% 12.1\u00a0% 12.2\u00a0% 13.0 pp 21.8 pp Louisville, KY 9.3\u00a0% 14.5\u00a0% 13.3\u00a0% 29.4 pp 38.1 pp New Orleans, LA 5.3\u00a0% 17.4\u00a0% 11.3\u00a0% 22.4 pp 26.4 pp Salt Lake City, UT 5.8\u00a0% 3.6\u00a0% 3.0\u00a0% 7.5 pp 45.0 pp Hartford, CT 9.4\u00a0% 13.5\u00a0% 15.7\u00a0% 23.4 pp 32.5 pp Buffalo, NY 9.5\u00a0% 14.1\u00a0% 13.4\u00a0% 41.5 pp 33.1 pp Birmingham, AL 9.9\u00a0% 11.1\u00a0% 11.5\u00a0% 46.4 pp 28.0 pp\n\nAbout Zillow Group: Zillow Group, Inc.

        "content": "zillow-lenders\n\nArizona Regional MLS and Wisconsin-based Metro MLS are looking to have the antitrust lawsuit filed against them by Zillow Groupand ShowingTime dismissed.\n\nFiled in late December 2023, the lawsuit alleges that ARMLS, Metro MLS and the parent company of showing platform Aligned Showings, MLS Aligned, are \u201cunlawfully attempting to monopolize the market for real estate showing management services in the geographic regions they control and from unlawfully conspiring to exclude or severely limit ShowingTime, their competitor in those markets.\u201d\n\nAccording to the initial complaint, in late 2023, the MLS defendants made the decision to only offer Aligned Showings to their members instead of both Aligned Showings and ShowingTime, which had been offered through the MLS defendants \u201cfor years.\u201d MLS Aligned is a joint venture set up among the MLS defendants and other unspecified MLSs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the MLS defendnats filed a motion to dismiss the suit with prejudice, writing that \u201cThe Court should look at this purported antitrust case with great skepticism from the outset.\u201d\n\nIn the motion, the defendants claim that Zillow and ShowingTime\u2019s \u201ctrue grievance is not that the MLS Defendants are engaging in anticompetitive practices, but that\u00a0ShowingTime\u2014the dominant provider of showing management services nationally\u2014is (ironically) now facing competition in a few regions.\u201d\n\nAccording to the motion, the complaint is falsely interpreting antitrust law, alleging that the plaintiffs view competition as a \u201cmortal threat\u201d and not a \u201ccornerstone of American capitalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourts long have affirmed that the \u2018central purpose\u2019 of the antitrust laws is to preserve and foster competition,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThose acts that result in more competition are therefore both consistent with, and further the basic goals of, the antitrust laws. Here, however, the dominant player in the market for showing management services (ShowingTime) and its corporate parent (Zillow) seek to impose antitrust liability on Defendants\u2014and to recover treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees\u2014for alleged injuries that flow directly from an increase in competition.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIn their motion, the defendants state that their decision to work solely with MLS Aligned was \u201cnot the product of any collusion of conspiracy.\u201d The defendants state that in 2023, they made an independent assessment and determined that it was in their best interests to choose to work with a different provider.\n\nThe motion also claims that the complaint doesn\u2019t contain sufficient factual matter, and that the complaint fails to allege an antitrust injury and an actionable antitrust violation.\n\nZillow Group, which bought ShowingTime in 2021, did not return a request for comment.",

        "title": "Have kids? Good luck buying a house this year",
        "content": "Families with kids are being boxed out of the increasingly unaffordable U.S. housing market as the cost of both a new mortgage and child care soar higher.\n\nA recent study published by Zillow found that potential homebuyers with children are likely to spend 66% of their income on monthly mortgage payments and child care, a sharp increase from about 50% in 2019.\n\nThe typical American family can expect to spend about $1,984 per month on child care and $1,973 on a monthly mortgage payment (based on an interest rate of 6.6%). With the monthly median household income hovering around $6,640, that leaves just $2,683 for other necessary expenses, including food, health care, insurance, transportation, retirement savings and education. A home for sale in Cupertino, California, on Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is that housing should cost no more than 30% of a person's monthly income, while the Department of Health and Human Services recommends that families spend no more than 7% of their income on child care expenses.\n\nBut the typical household exceeds these guidelines in every market that Zillow analyzed, a trend that underscores how far out of reach the American dream has become for millions of families.\n\nMORTGAGE CALCULATOR: SEE HOW MUCH HIGHER RATES COULD COST YOU\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIn fact, in 31 of the largest 50 metropolitan areas with available child care cost data, families looking to buy a home can expect to spend more than 60% of their income on their mortgage and child care expenses.\n\nThe cost burden is even worse in some parts of the country. Parents in Los Angeles and San Diego would need to dedicate a respective 121% and 113% of their income to pay for child care and a mortgage. In both Boston and Seattle, families would need to spend 92%. A classroom at The Growing Tree Academy in New Glarus, Wisconsin, on Sept. 13, 2023.\n\nHousing affordability is the worst it's been in decades, thanks to a spike in home prices and mortgage rates. Combined, the two have helped to push the typical portion of average wages nationwide required for major homeownership expenses up to 33%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are several reasons to blame for the affordability crisis.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate hike campaign sent mortgage rates soaring above 8% for the first time in nearly two decades last year. Rates have been slow to retreat, hovering near 7% as hotter-than-expected inflation data dashed investors' hopes for immediate rate cuts.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed loan rose to 6.77% last week, Freddie Mac reported, well above the pandemic-era lows of 3%.\n\nEven though mortgage rates are nearly double what they were three years ago, home prices have hardly budged. That is largely due to a lack of available homes for sale. Sellers who locked in a low mortgage rate before the pandemic began have been reluctant to sell, leaving few options for eager would-be buyers.\n\n\"This rapid home price appreciation, coupled with mortgage rates that recently hit decades-long highs, means many home buyers must make trade-offs in order to afford other necessary expenses, such as child care,\" the Zillow analysis said.\n\nOriginal article source:Have kids?

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 18 fastest-declining cities in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global housing market, then you can go directly to 5 Fastest-Declining Cities in the US.\n\nAn Analysis of Trends in the Housing Market\n\nAccording to a report by the National Association of Realtors, home sales in the US declined by 1.0% and reached an annual rate of 3.78 million in 2023. This has been the lowest level of sales in the past 3 decades, with the usual annual rate being 4.09 million. The number of sales declined 6.2% between 2022-2023. On the bright side, the median existing-home sales price increased 4.4% between 2022-2023, reaching a rate of $382,600.\n\nSavills reported that in 2022, the residential real estate market decreased in sales by 1.6%, whereas commercial real estate fell by 1.8%. The residential real estate market did incur benefits from low interest rates during the pandemic era, post-2019. During this period, the majority of people choose to invest in the redevelopment of their current residential assets rather than new properties. Investments into commercial real estate, as well as agricultural land, were on the back burner.\n\nMultiple sources, such as RealAssets Adviser, have reported a continuing increase in population shifts to the 'US Sunbelt'. The collective 18 southern states between North Carolina and California are known as the Sunbelt. Statistically about 75% of the US population has shifted to the Sun Belt states over the past decade. This is largely due to the lower rates of taxation, affordable housing, and most importantly, a growing commercial and business sector. Single-family homes that were otherwise unaffordable outside of the Sunbelt are increasingly being bought in these states, even multi-family homes. These states have less dense populations and have far less congested metropolitan areas compared to major cities like New York.\n\nThe growth of social media and digitization in general has been quite fruitful for the real estate market, among other sectors. Real estate manufacturers and agents have utilized various modes of virtual reality to increase sales, without having buyers physically visit numerous properties. 3D Tours, Drone photographs and videos, and virtual staging are some of the most common ways agents conduct virtual tours of properties. An example of this is Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), an online real estate company. Zillow has a home-valuation tool that allows buyers to compare the value of the home based on sales history and the local market. Moreover, the company lets users buy properties online after taking virtual tours of the property.

(NASDAQ:LGIH), Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM), and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL). You can also take a look at 20 Countries where Housing Prices are Declining or Flat.\n\nKey Players in the Housing Market\n\nLGI Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:LGIH) is a Texas-based home construction and selling company. The company has manufactured over 65,000 homes in the US, with a business model focused on family homes.

Terrata Homes would be part of the Southern Hills neighborhood, a prime community in Brooksville. These new homes would offer four different designs to home buyers and include a wide range of first-class amenities.\n\nKimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) in the US, with a considerable portfolio of commercial properties. The company focuses on re-developing sub-urban areas to increase commercial activity. On January 2, Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) announced its latest acquisition of RPT Realty. This acquisition will bring 56 open-air shopping centers to the company's portfolio, taking the company's total properties to 527. Furthermore, the RPT acquisition will increase growth and partnership opportunities for the company.\n\nToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is a luxury home builder and a Fortune 500 company.

        "title": "Decoding Zillow Group Inc (ZG): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Strengths: Zillow Group Inc's robust brand presence and innovative technology set the stage for industry leadership. Weaknesses: The company faces challenges in a competitive and rapidly evolving market. Opportunities: Zillow's vision of a \"housing super app\" could revolutionize the real estate experience. Threats: Macroeconomic factors and rising mortgage rates pose significant risks to Zillow's business model.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ZG.\n\nOn February 15, 2024, Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ:ZG) filed its annual 10-K report, offering a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic positioning. As an internet-based real estate giant, Zillow Group Inc has made a name for itself by providing transparent and easy experiences for customers engaging in real estate transactions. The company's financial tables reveal a strategic focus on growth and innovation, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. With a living database of approximately 160 million U.S. homes and a median error rate of 2.3% for homes listed for sale, Zillow's Zestimate feature continues to be a cornerstone of its value proposition. The company's financial strength is underscored by its ability to attract a monthly high of 233 million unique users and generate approximately 10.0 billion visits in 2023, demonstrating its significant market reach and consumer trust. Decoding Zillow Group Inc (ZG): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Power and Market Presence: Zillow Group Inc's brand is a formidable asset, with the term \"Zillow\" being searched more than \"real estate\" in the United States. The company's online platforms, including Zillow, Trulia, and StreetEasy, attracted an annual monthly high of 233 million unique users in June 2023, showcasing its dominant market presence. This brand recognition is not only a testament to the company's marketing prowess but also to its ability to provide a user experience that resonates with consumers. Zillow's strong brand has become synonymous with residential real estate, which is a significant strength in attracting and retaining users.\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnological Innovation and Data Science: Zillow Group Inc's competitive edge is further sharpened by its superior data science and technology. The Zestimate feature, a patented proprietary automated valuation model, is a prime example of the company's innovative capabilities. With a median error rate of 2.3% for homes listed for sale, Zillow's data accuracy is a critical strength that bolsters consumer confidence and engagement. The company's living database of approximately 160 million U.S. homes forms the backbone of its various analytical models, making Zillow a go-to source for real-time home value estimates and market insights.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMarket Competition and Fragmentation: Despite its strong brand and technological advantages, Zillow Group Inc operates in a highly fragmented and competitive market. With over 201,000 real estate brokerages and over 70,000 mortgage lenders in the U.S., the company must continuously innovate to maintain its market position. Zillow Home Loans, for instance, comprises less than 0.09% of the mortgages originated in the U.S., indicating the intense competition in the mortgage origination space. This competitive landscape requires Zillow to constantly refine its offerings and enhance its value proposition to stay ahead.\n\nDependence on Macroeconomic Factors: Zillow's business is significantly influenced by macroeconomic conditions, such as housing inventory levels, mortgage interest rates, and home price fluctuations. These factors can impact the number of real estate transactions and demand for services, posing a weakness that the company must navigate. The recent economic uncertainty and volatile interest rate environment have challenged Zillow's ability to predict and adapt to market changes, potentially affecting its growth and profitability.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion of \"Housing Super App\": Zillow Group Inc's vision to create a \"housing super app\" presents a substantial opportunity to revolutionize the real estate industry. By integrating various services related to buying, selling, renting, and financing into a single ecosystem, Zillow can offer a seamless and comprehensive experience for consumers. This strategy aligns with the growing consumer demand for convenience and could position Zillow as a central hub for all real estate-related activities, driving increased engagement and revenue per transaction.\n\nEnhancing Rental Marketplace: With an estimated three times more households moving to a new rental than purchasing a home in the U.S., Zillow's focus on building a comprehensive rental marketplace is a significant opportunity. By offering services such as Zillow Rental Manager and connecting renters with property management and landlord partners, Zillow can tap into the vast market of nearly 48 million rental units. Enhancements to the rental platform, such as the addition of room for rent listings and a universal application feature, can further solidify Zillow's position in the rental space.\n\nThreats\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainties: The residential real estate market is sensitive to macroeconomic factors, which pose a threat to Zillow Group Inc's business. Rising mortgage rates, low housing supply, and affordability challenges can deter potential buyers and sellers, affecting Zillow's transaction volumes and revenue. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to these external pressures to mitigate their impact on its operations and financial performance.\n\nTechnological and Security Risks: As a technology-driven company, Zillow must continuously invest in maintaining and enhancing its security measures to protect data integrity and customer privacy. The reliance on third-party services for critical business functions also introduces risks associated with data breaches and system failures. Additionally, the need to innovate and protect intellectual property, especially with the advent of generative artificial intelligence, is a constant threat that requires ongoing attention and resources.\n\nIn conclusion, Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ:ZG) presents a compelling case of a company with strong market presence and technological prowess, poised to capitalize on significant opportunities in the real estate sector. However, it must navigate\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

We will now open the call with remarks followed by live Q&A. With that, I will turn over the call to Rich.\n\nStory continues\n\nRich Barton: Thank you, Siarah. And thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for dialing-in for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. We are posting great revenue numbers across the whole of our increasingly diversified and growing businesses. Our early cohort of enhanced markets are working. So we are pressing the accelerator on expansion in 2024. I'm also pleased to share that we released an updated investor presentation available on our Investor Relations website to bring them all up to speed on the progress we've made on our growth pillars. We'll kick off the discussion today by walking you through our quarterly results, briefly addressing what's happening in the broader real estate industry, highlighting the opportunity in front of Zillow and then take you through the exciting progress we're making on our journey to innovate and transform the way people buy, sell, finance and rent homes.\n\nStarting with our quarterly results, we reported better than expected and accelerated revenue growth with Q4 total revenue of $474 million, up 9% year-over-year. Residential revenue of $349 million increased 3% year-over-year, returning to positive year-over-year growth. During the same timeframe, the broader real estate industry declined by 4%, meaning Zillow's residential revenue outperformed the industry by 700 basis points. As I said, Q4 now marks the sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful outperformance versus the industry. Our ongoing efforts to improve our customer funnel, capture more demand, connect more of that demand to our partner network and focus on conversion, continue to drive impressive results. Rentals also had a strong quarter with accelerating revenue growth, up 37% year-over-year to $93 million.\n\nThis performance was driven by Accelerating Multifamily Property growth with over 37,000 properties listed across Zillow at the end of Q4 2023. We continue to be the number one most visited rentals platform with average monthly rentals, unique users up double digits year-over-year in Q4. We are well-positioned for future rentals revenue growth which Jeremy Wacksman will discuss in more detail later in the call. We're also making excellent progress in our mortgages push, growing our purchase mortgage origination volume by more than 100% year-over-year in Q4 and further integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partners. Before we dive deeper into all the progress we've made over the last two years. I'd like to give our view of the latest real estate industry goings on.\n\nWe're monitoring the progress of numerous lawsuits facing several organizations within the industry. Zillow is not a named party in these suits. And we are confident in our ability to meaningfully grow our company in this evolving climate. In November, we laid out our marketplace principles that underlie Zillow's position. We continue to advocate for what we believe is best for consumers and the industry as a whole. First, we believe in our real estate marketplace that is transparent and fair in which consumers and agents have easy and equitable access to listings and information. Second, we believe buyers and sellers deserve independent representation. And finally, we believe consumers should be well-informed on agent compensation and their rights to negotiate.\n\nRecently we elaborated on these views on a new webpage advocacy.zillowgroup.com that outlines consumers real estate rights and how we are working to elevate industry standards on their behalf. This includes efforts to allow better integrated search experiences that can include all listing types in one view, be there for sale by agent, for sale by owner, new construction or for rent, as well as to educate consumers on the potential pitfalls of double citing with dual agency among others. We recently supported legislation in our home state of Washington that requires buyer's agent agreements so that consumers are aware of the services, they are buying and who pays. In New York, our Street Easy and Zillow teams are working with lawmakers and advocates to create much needed transparency for consumers, ensure agents are fairly compensated and open the door for more access and affordability in New York's rental market.\n\nThose are just a few examples, but the key takeaway is that we have found a louder and crisper voice championing what's good for mover consumers, agents and the industry as a whole given legacy practices are being actively debated and negotiated right now. Settlements and court ordered equitable relief may provide some near-term direction for the industry and some industry practices will likely be improved. For example, it could become more common to use buyer agent agreements to make fees more transparent and negotiable. But ultimately, we continue to expect industry change to play out over many years. Regardless of the industry debates, Zillow is well-positioned for all weather due to our long history and future of technology innovation driving differentiated products and services which has resulted in a large engaged audience a beloved brand and a growing diversified business.\n\nWe believe all roads lead to Zillow. Zooming out from our quarterly results and the latest state of play in the real estate industry, two years ago, we introduced our new growth strategy and broke down the massive TAM opportunity for Zillow. This quarter, we released a refined and better way to size that opportunity, resulting in a $30 billion accessible TAM of customers already in our funnel and raising their hands to connect. I'll do the math to arrive at this number in a moment and then pass it over to Jeremy Wacksman to talk you through the progress we've made over the last two years. The proof points, the signal, why we are confident in pressing the accelerator on expansion. We are pleased with what we've accomplished since laying out our growth pillars in early 2022.\n\nWe see this strategy as a continuation of what we've been working on since we founded the company in 2006 with the charge of turning on the lights in real estate. Over the years, we've built engaging and practical products and services designed to empower consumers with data and information, transforming a previously opaque marketplace into the more transparent one we experienced today. But turning on the lights only got Zillow and our large audience so far, to effect real change for consumers and open up a much larger opportunity we needed to focus on digital transformation of the moving experience end-to-end and begin our work on the transaction itself. Every one of those move knows that the process is complicated, time consuming and expensive.\n\nThe onus is primarily on the consumer to play the role of project managers/systems integrator to research, shop, select, finance, appraise and close, bringing all these disparate pieces together. It's a labyrinth and it's clear that consumers want and need better. And they'll eventually get it, they always do. So, we set out to build the housing Super App and integrated digital experience wherein all the disparate pieces of the [indiscernible] moving process are brought together on one platform, Zillow. Rooted in our original commitment to turn on the lights, Zillow's housing Super App empowers consumers by delivering real estate data and education, a suite of Zillow owned solutions and a network of best-in-class partners at their fingertips.\n\nWell, the housing Super App is here today, it's called the Zillow. Zillow is now the container into which we will continually place new features and services that work together seamlessly to solve real customer and partner pain points in their moves. We have tested and iterated the experience over the last two years updating you all along the way. Our growth pillars, which Jeremy Wacksman will talk more about in a moment, serve as a roadmap for the continual upgrades and improvements we are adding to the Zillow experience as we expand our breadth and depth of coverage across more markets. Our opportunity is to take our current small slice of a large total addressable market and grow it into a much bigger piece of the pie. U.S. For Sale Housing represents $2 trillion in total transaction value or TTV.\n\nOf that $2 trillion of TTV, there were approximately $162 billion of service fees in 2023 across buy and sell side agent referral fees, mortgage fees and closing fees. Based on survey data, we estimate that 70% of all consumers who transact, visit and use Zillow, resulting in a $113 billion Zillow Visitor TAM. Cutting that down to just shoppers who raised their hands on Zillow, meaning, they proactively request to connect with one or more of our services. We estimate first, a $16 billion opportunity made up of brokerage referral, mortgage, closing and other homebuyer related transaction fees associated with those higher intent buyers. This is low hanging fruit buy side TAM, not just people visiting our site, but actual buyers actively engaged in seeking to do business with us.\n\nAdditionally, on the sell side we have good line of sight on an estimated $14 billion of sell side TAM derived from our increasing opportunity to capture more sell side referral fees and listing marketing budgets from those agents already actively engaged in our funnel. This adds up to a current accessible $30 billion For Sale revenue opportunity with high intent, hand raising consumers already in Zillow's funnel. Today, we captured $1.5 billion of that $30 billion accessible TAM. That $1.5 billion is our reported 2023 Residential and Mortgages Revenue. Measured as a fraction of TTV we stood at a mere 7 basis points in 2023. Oh, my, so much Blue Ocean. Our position as one of the largest Internet brands in the United States alongside iconic brands such as Facebook, Spotify and Netflix gives us confidence that we have many years of growth into that $30 billion of revenue TAM accessible in our funnel today.\n\nOver the last 15 plus years, we've released a constant stream of novel engaging and practical product innovations. We just have great brands are created. Zillow Brand has over 60% unaided brand awareness amongst shoppers which is rare for a brand to achieve in any category. Okay, that is of course internal survey data, but you can see a good impartial proxy for this strength in our Google search activity where Zillow was searched more on Google than the category term \"real estate\". And three times more than our nearest competitors brand. Further evidence of our brand strength is seen in our traffic composition. About 80% of Zilliow's traffic is organic. As well as in our app usage, which is more than three times our nearest competitor. We pioneered mobile real estate shopping with our leading iPhone and Android apps.\n\nAnd when Apple first launch the iPad, the Zillow app was highlighted by Steve Jobs on stage at the launch event. Taking things full circle, this month we partnered with Apple once again for the launch of Zillow Immerse on the new Apple Vision Pro to offer mover consumers and interactive and immersive way to explore listing showcase listings with special technology. Try it. It's early, but it's an extraordinary home touring experience. We have been and will continue to be the company that is on the leading edge of utilizing technology to create magic new consumer and agent experiences. So I've laid out a more refined view of the opportunities as we see it, quite large, quite complex, quite accessible for us. We monetize very little of it today, yet it's in our store.\n\nI've also outlined the reasons to believe that Zillow can and will tap this $30 billion accessible TAM. One, we have the leading audience brand and engagement. Two, we have proven technology and product talent that is unrivaled in the real estate industry. Three, we have built an extensive talented and increasingly integrated partner network. And four, we have a strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to pursue current and future growth opportunities. For these reasons, we are uniquely well-positioned to transform and re-platform the largest industry in the country. We spent the last two years building the integrated transaction experience and testing it in enhanced markets. Now it's time to press down on the accelerator to increase our breadth of coverage across more markets and our depth of penetration in those markets.\n\nWe made a great deal of progress in 2023, we will make more in 2024. Okay. I've talked about our opportunity and our vision for the future of real estate. Now, I will pass the microphone over to our COO, Jeremy Wacksman to give you a more detailed progress report and where we are headed.\n\nJeremy Wacksman: Thank you, Rich. And good afternoon, everyone. As Rich said, Zillow's housing Super App is the container into which we are continually adding upgrades and improvements, guided by five for sale growth pillars, touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. Our For Sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow our revenue alongside that transaction share growth. You'll note that we've also added rentals as an additional growth pillar this quarter. We're excited about the opportunities here as our rentals marketplace continues to accelerate and accounted for nearly 20% of Zillow's total revenue in 2023.\n\nI'll kick off our growth pillar update with touring. The investments we're making here continue to drive our industry outperformance. When a customer raises her hand to look at a home she has been coveting on Zillow, it's a strong signal of serious intend to transact. As we work to convert more visitors on our site into transactors, the home tour remains a critical focus area for us. Touring has historically been painful for both movers and agents. So we've invested in making the process more seamless than it's ever been. Our real-time touring product powered by showing time is meaningfully improving our ability to connect high intent customers to our premier agent partners. We ended Q4 with our real-time touring product delivering approximately 10% of our total connections.\n\nWe expect to expand our breadth of coverage by launching additional markets and increase our depth by growing real-time touring to account for approximately 20% of connections by the end of 2024. This is driving a better customer and agent experience with less friction. As we see increased successful connections and more customers working with agents. Equally as important as touring is financing. And as a reminder, approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage and 80% of those buyers don't yet have an agents. Knowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow positions us well to build a substantial direct to consumer purchase mortgage business that is seamlessly integrated with our extensive premier agent partner network. A team of real estate agents trading tips and tricks in a modern office, representing markets across the country.\n\nBy integrating Zillow Home Loans with our premier agent partner network, we are creating a better customer experience from the start of the homebuying journey on Zillow to when a customer moves into that brand new home. And it's clear that customers and partners are increasingly enjoying this integrated housing Super App experience. Most notably our efforts are driving purchase mortgage growth. In our original four enhanced markets, we saw our customer adoption rates climb from 6% to 15% over the course of 2023. Since Q1 2023, the percentage of purchase mortgages in which a customer works with a premier agent partner increased from 23% to 53%. All of this success translates to $487 million in purchase loan origination volume this quarter, a more than 100% year-over-year increase despite a very challenging mortgage rate environment.\n\nWe expect continued mortgage growth as we follow our roadmap 2025. Expanding integration with premier agent partners, rolling out more enhanced markets and converting more high intent customers on Zillow. I'll now move on to seller services honing in on listing showcase. Listing showcase elevates agents brand presence on Zillow and helps them win more listings. Our AI powered listing showcase also improved the shopper experience through listings that are powered by our homegrown rich media and floor plan technology. This is a unique differentiator in the marketplace and a significant benefit to buyer engagement and experience. We are in the early days of this product having launched in Q3, but it is clear already there is significant demand from listing agents and significant engagement with consumers.\n\nListing showcase listings received 68% more page views, 66% more saves, 63% more shares. We are actively rolling out listing showcase nationwide with the intermediate term goal of 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity. And we believe there is potential future growth beyond that. Moving onto our next growth pillar update, enhancing our partner network. Our mandate here is simple, help the best agents provide better service to more of our shared customers to grow their businesses and our business. And we are doing this in a few ways. First, we're expanding our enhanced market partners. Increasing our depth of coverage in existing markets and our breadth by growing our enhanced market footprint from nine at the end of 2023 to a projected 40 markets by the end of 2024.\n\nSecond, we're working to deliver the integrated experience between ZHL and premier agent. As a result, one in two premier agent partners in our enhanced markets are now introducing their customers to Zillow Home Loans, and that's up from one in five at the end of 2022. Lastly, we are excited to accelerate improvements to Follow Up Boss and make it available to more agents to increase conversion. With the power of Follow Up Boss, our premier agent partners will be better equipped than ever to deliver the best possible customer experience, whilst supercharging their businesses. We think these efforts across the board will drive transaction conversion to help close the gap on the vast majority of Zillow Connections that transact elsewhere and better tap the $30 billion accessible revenue TAM that Rich walked you through.\n\nMoving onto our last For Sale growth pillar update, integrating our services. Doing this requires us to pull together consumer, agent and loan officer technology in one place, Zillow, to create an end-to-end experience that carries the customer through the entire transaction process with more transparency and ease. It's no small feat, but it's what consumers want and we're in the best-positioned to deliver to them. As evidenced by our performance in our earliest two enhanced markets, Phoenix and Atlanta, our integrated strategy is working to drive customer transaction share gains. Since the beginning of 2022, our customer transaction share has grown more than 80%. Additionally, across our entire set of nine enhanced markets, we are seeing consistent outperformance in connections growth versus the industry.\n\nThis gives us great confidence to further expand our enhanced markets footprint more rapidly in 2024. As we expand to a projected 40 enhanced markets by the end of 2024, our integration within those markets is going to cover 20% of total Zillow connections by the end of the year. We land in each market with a subset of partner and customer coverage and work to expand our product offerings across the market over time. We are seeing share gains that will move the needle as we roll out more enhanced markets throughout the year into 2025. I'll wrap up with a progress update on rentals. Rentals is a fast growing business with a big opportunity in front of it. Nearly every homebuyer starts out as a renter and providing our customers with optionality is as important as ever in a challenging housing market.\n\nToday, we have the largest audience of rentals and the most listings in the market with limited marketing spend to date. We're now leveraging our position as traffic leader to grow our multifamily properties, which has accelerated our multifamily revenue growth year-on year from 14% in Q4 2022 to 52% in Q4 2023. As we look to serve more of this market and grow revenue, we plan to expand the number of multifamily properties and deliver a superior experience for our rentals partners. Before handing it over to Jeremy Hofmann, I do want to highlight that while we've been building these past few years, we've meaningfully outperformed a challenged housing market. For full year 2023, Zillow reported over $1.9 billion in revenue, outperforming the real estate industry by 1,600 basis points.\n\nI'm grateful to our teams who have been working hard to bring Zillow's housing Super App to life over the last two years, solving real customer pain points with exceptional tech solutions and partners. We are looking forward to continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will now pass the line over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Hofmann: Thanks, Jeremy. And hello, everyone. As you've heard from Rich and Jeremy, we are pleased with how we've executed on our strategy and we are starting to see those efforts show up in our financial results despite the persistently challenging housing macro backdrop. In my comments today, I will cover our Q4 results, our outlook for Q1, some early thoughts on 2024 to help you all understand how we expect the year to play out, as well as the financial philosophy that underpins how we\u2019ll manage the business moving forward. I will start with our Q4 2023 results, which exceeded expectations across the board. Revenue growth accelerated in Q4, up 9% year-over-year to $474 million, which was more than $31 million above the midpoint of our outlook range.\n\nRevenue outperformance was driven by acceleration across each of our revenue lines for residential, mortgages and rentals. On a GAAP basis, Q4 net loss was $73 million, representing 15% of our revenue. EBITDA was $69 million for the quarter. When excluding the impact of a $14 million one-time expense related to the partial lease termination of our Seattle office space, EBITDA would have been $83 million, resulting in an 18% EBITDA margin and marking a return to positive year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results despite a macro housing environment that remains constraint. Going a quick deeper, the partial lease termination option for our Seattle office space, which we previewed on our last earnings call was exercised in December.\n\nAs a result, we estimate our 2024 facilities costs will decrease by $8 million and we will release an estimated $37 million in EBITDA expenses in total over the remaining life of the Seattle lease, which more than makes up for this one-time expense impacting our Q4 EBITDA. Returning to more details on the quarter, our Q4 residential revenue of $349 million outperformed our outlook range and revenue growth accelerated to 3% year-over-year. Our residential revenue performance was 700 basis points above the industry decline of 4%, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. We believe our Q4 outperformance was primarily driven by our ongoing investments in our top of funnel and mid funnel experiences that continue to drive improvements in our overall lead volumes.\n\nRentals revenue growth accelerated in Q4 with revenue increasing 37% year-over-year to $93 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 52% year-over-year in Q4. Our rental strategy is working well and our team is executing on growing the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites, which reached an all-time high of 37,000 multifamily properties as of year-end. Total listings across our entire rentals marketplace were also up 40% year-over-year to an industry leading 1.7 million listings. Mortgages revenue of $22 million in Q4 returned to positive growth, up 22% year-over-year. With purchased loan origination volume growing 105% year-over-year. We are executing on our mortgage strategy to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans.\n\nThe tools and integration capabilities we have built are creating a bridge between premier agent partners, ZHL loan officers and our buyer customers, which is why we are seeing more than 50% of funded loans across all markets coming from customers working with a premier agent partner. This was a critical puzzle for us to solve before expanding more rapidly in 2024 and we are pleased with the progress to date. EBITDA expenses in Q4 totaled $405 million. Excluding the one-time partial lease termination expense I mentioned earlier, EBITDA expenses would have totaled $391 million, roughly flat sequentially from Q3. And at the low end of our outlook range as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Cost of revenue increased $26 million or 29% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continue to test and release new products.\n\nWe ended the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments, down from $3.3 billion at the end of Q3. This includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities, the impact of $88 million in share repurchases during Q4. The impact of $56 million towards convertible debt repurchases below par. And the approximately $400 million closing cash purchase price, a Follow Up Boss. Post repurchases of convertible debt in the quarter, we have $1.6 billion of principal outstanding. Before turning the page to 2024, I want to highlight how pleased I am with our execution throughout the entirety of 2023. We accelerated revenue growth from a decrease of 13% year-over-year in Q1 to an increase of 9% year-over-year in Q4. When combining the revenue growth with a disciplined approach to our cost structure, we feel well-positioned entering this year.\n\nTurning to our outlook for Q1, I first want to level set on what we expect for existing homes total transaction value. We estimate total transaction value to be between a decline of 4% to up 1% year-over-year in Q1. With that as a backdrop, we expect total company revenue to be between $495 million to $510 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 7% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $365 million to $375 million, up 2% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. Despite the tough macro existing home sales environment, we expect our residential revenue to outperform the industry in Q1 as our growth pillars begin to contribute to revenue and the investments we have made in our overall funnel continue to deliver benefits.\n\nWe expect rentals revenue to continue to grow more than 30% year-over-year in Q1 as we benefit from the strength of our execution and favorable industry backdrop, driving landlord demand for advertisers. We expect positive growth in mortgages revenue year-over-year in Q1. We plan to expand integration with our premier agent partners in enhanced markets, send more of our mortgage leads to ZHL directly and drive engagement with more consumers on our apps and sites to grow our origination volumes. For Q1, we expect EBITDA to be between $95 million and $105 million, implying a 20% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from the $391 million in Q4 that excludes the lease termination expense. The increase is being driven by three primary factors.\n\nOne, we take on a full quarter of operating costs for Follow Up Boss. Two, there is an annual increase in payroll taxes that occurs every Q1. And three, we are staffing up variable head count for sales, given the growth we expect in 2024 from rentals, listing showcase and Zillow Home Loans. Moving onto 2024 as a whole, we want to provide some color for how we expect the year to play out based on the information we have today. First, we are currently assuming that the housing market is relatively flat in aggregate for the year. With that as a backdrop, we expect to drive double digit revenue growth for the full year, implying accelerated year-over-year revenue growth throughout the year from the high single digits in Q1 that I discussed in our outlook.\n\nAs we increased the breadth and depth of our products and services throughout the year, we expect our growth pillars will drive the vast majority of the revenue growth across our business in 2024. More specifically, in our residential revenue category, we expect continued market outperformance as we expand touring, make top of funnel improvements, integrate Follow Up Boss into our sales motions and expand the rollout of listing showcase. I will note that we expect the revenue contribution from Follow Up Boss to be a low single digit percentage of our total company revenue in 2024. In rentals, we expect continued strong growth as we increase our multifamily properties and total listings. In mortgages, we expect Zillow Home Loans integration with premier agents and our enhanced market expansion to drive meaningful growth.\n\nOn the cost side, we believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation and our variable cost growing with or slightly ahead of revenue initially as we ramp up new hires to be fully productive. When combining our expected revenue growth and cost discipline, we expect modest EBITDA margin expansion for the full year. Beyond our revenue and EBITDA expenses, share based compensation expense is an area of focus for us. We expect the absolute dollars of 2024, share based compensation expense to be lower than 2023. And we expect to leverage SBC as a percentage of revenue from the combination of lower absolute dollars in SBC expense and projected revenue growth. Stepping back from our Q4 results, Q1 outlook and 2024 early thoughts, I want to discuss the financial philosophy we have as a company as we execute on our go forward strategy.\n\nAs you heard from both Rich and Jeremy, Zillow today is a much different business from what it was several years ago. Our revenue base has diversified to the point where a majority of our revenue is now derived from sources other than buyside fees. We have growth pillars, we are executing against and are excited about with a $30 billion For Sale revenue opportunity accessible in our funnel today. As we continue to execute on our growth pillars, while controlling fixed costs and gaining leverage on share based compensation expense, we expect to deliver operating leverage resulting in strong GAAP profitability over time. Beyond our organic investments, we have made several acquisitions to accelerate our growth pillars. For example, we acquired showing time in 2021, which accelerated our launch of real-time touring.\n\nSince then, we acquired two real estate media businesses. [BRX] (ph) scenario to scale showing time plus as listing showcase product with both first party and third party photographers. We also acquired Spruce, a tech enabled title and closing business to add to our housing Super App experience over time. And most recently we acquired Follow Up Boss to create a best-in-class CRM for our premier agents and the industry. M&A is not our core strategy. However, we will continue to pursue selective opportunities when we find ways to accelerate our growth pillars. Beyond our day-to-day operating philosophy, we have been active in deploying capital over the past several years, returning $1.7 million to shareholders since the beginning of our stock repurchase program in Q4 2021.\n\nAnd we plan to continue to be opportunistic with the program going forward. Last, we remain focused on retiring our outstanding convertible debt. In 2023, we repurchased a total of $58 million in principal of our 2025 notes. We now have $1.6 billion of convertible senior notes which we may opportunistically redeemed if they become callable. To close, I'll reiterate what you have heard from us before. 2022 was a year where we re-strategize and reorganized around our housing Super App vision. 2023 was a year for us to release new products and test in various markets, setting us up for more depth and more breadth in 2024 and 2025. We are clearly executing on our strategy and look forward to sharing more updates throughout 2024. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you.

I'm also pleased to share that we've released an updated investor presentation available on our Investor Relations website to bring you all up to speed on the progress we've made on our growth pillars. \r\nWe'll kick off the discussion today by walking you through our quarterly results, briefly addressing what's happening in the broader real estate industry, highlighting the opportunity in front of Zillow and then taking you through the exciting progress we're making on our journey to innovate and transform the way people buy, sell, finance and rent homes. \r\nStarting with our quarterly results, we reported better-than-expected and accelerated revenue growth, with Q4 total revenue of $474 million, up 9% year-over-year. Residential revenue of $349 million increased 3% year-over-year, returning to positive year-over-year growth. During the same time frame, the broader real estate industry declined by 4%, meaning Zillow's residential revenue outperformed the industry by 700 basis points. \r\nAs I said, Q4 now marks the sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful outperformance versus the industry. Our ongoing efforts to improve our customer funnel, capture more demand, connect more of that demand to our partner network and focus on conversion continue to drive impressive results. \r\nRentals also had a strong quarter, with accelerating revenue growth up 37% year-over-year to $93 million. This performance was driven by accelerating multifamily property growth with over 37,000 properties listed across Zillow at the end of Q4 2023. We continue to be the #1 most visited rentals platform, with average monthly rentals' unique users up double digits year-over-year in Q4. We are well positioned for future rentals revenue growth, which Jeremy Wacksman will discuss in more detail later in the call. \r\nWe're also making excellent progress in our mortgages' push, growing our purchase mortgage origination volume by more than 100% year-over-year in Q4 and further integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partners. Before we dive deeper into all the progress we've made over the last 2 years, I'd like to give our view of the latest real estate industry goings-on. \r\nWe're monitoring the progress of numerous lawsuits facing several organizations within the industry. Zillow is not a named party in these suits, and we are confident in our ability to meaningfully grow our company in this evolving climate. In November, we laid out our marketplace principles that underlie Zillow's position. We continue to advocate for what we believe is best for consumers and the industry as a whole. \r\nFirst, we believe in a real estate marketplace that is transparent and fair in which consumers and agents have easy and equitable access to listings and information. Second, we believe buyers and sellers deserve independent representation. And finally, we believe consumers should be well informed on agent compensation and their rights to negotiate. Recently, we elaborated on these views on a new web page, advocacy.zillowgroup.com, that outlines consumers' real estate rights and how we are working to elevate industry standards on their behalf. This includes: efforts to allow better integrated search experiences that can include all listing types in one view, be they for sale by agent, for sale by owner, new construction or for rent; as well as to educate consumers on the potential pitfalls of double siding with dual agency, among others. \r\nWe recently supported legislation in our home state of Washington that requires buyer's agent agreements so that consumers are aware of the services they are buying and who pays. In New York, our StreetEasy and Zillow teams are working with lawmakers and advocates to create much-needed transparency for consumers ensure agents are fairly compensated and open the door for more access and affordability in New York's rental market. \r\nThose are just a few examples, but the key takeaway is that we have found a louder and crisper voice championing what's good for mover consumers, agents and the industry as a whole, given legacy practices are being actively debated and negotiated right now. Settlements and court-ordered equitable relief may provide some near-term direction for the industry and some industry practices will likely be improved. For example, it can become more common to use buyer agent agreements to make fees more transparent and negotiable. But ultimately, we continue to expect industry change to play out over many years. \r\nRegardless of the industry debates, Zillow is well positioned for all weather due to our long history and future of technology innovation, driving differentiated products and services which has resulted in a large engaged audience, a beloved brand and a growing diversified business. We believe all roads lead to Zillow. \r\nZooming out from our quarterly results in the latest state of play in the real estate industry. Two years ago, we introduced our new growth strategy and broke down the massive TAM opportunity for Zillow. This quarter, we've released a refined and better way to size that opportunity, resulting in a $30 billion accessible TAM of customers already in our funnel and raising their hands to connect. \r\nI'll do the math to arrive at this number in a moment and then pass it over to Jeremy Wacksman to talk you through the progress we've made over the last 2 years, the proof points, the signal why we are confident in pressing the accelerator on expansion. We are pleased with what we have accomplished since laying out our growth pillars in early 2022. We see this strategy as a continuation of what we've been working on since we founded the company in 2006 with the charge of turning on the lights in real estate. \r\nOver the years, we've built engaging and practical products and services designed to empower consumers with data and information, transforming a previously opaque marketplace into the more transparent one we experienced today. But turning on the lights only got Zillow on our large audience so far. To affect real change for consumers and open up a much larger opportunity, we needed to focus on digital transformation of the moving experience end to end and begin our work on the transaction itself. \r\nEveryone who's moved knows that the process is complicated, time-consuming and expensive. The onus is primarily on the consumer to play the role of project manager/systems integrator to research, shop, select, finance, appraise and close, bringing all these discreet pieces together. It's a labyrinth, and it's clear that consumers want and need better, and they'll eventually get it. They always do. \r\nSo we set out to build the housing super app, an integrated digital experience wherein all the discreet pieces of the gnarly moving process are brought together on one platform: Zillow. Rooted in our original commitment to turn on the lights, Zillow's housing super app empowers consumers by delivering real estate data and education, a suite of Zillow-owned solutions and a network of best-in-class partners at their fingertips. \r\nWell, the housing super app is here today, it's called Zillow. Zillow is now the container into which we will continually place new features and services that work together seamlessly to solve real customer and partner pain points in their moves. We have tested and iterated the experience over the last 2 years, updating you all along the way. Our growth pillars, which Jeremy Wacksman will talk more about in a moment, serve as a road map for the continual upgrades and improvements we are adding to the Zillow experience as we expand our breadth and depth of coverage across more markets. \r\nOur opportunity is to take our current small slice of a large total addressable market and grow it into a much bigger piece of the pie. U.S. for sale housing represents $2 trillion in total transaction value, or TTV. Of that $2 trillion of TTV, there were approximately $162 billion of service fees in 2023 across buy and sell side agent referral fees, mortgage fees and closing fees. Based on survey data, we estimate that 70% of all consumers who transact visit and use Zillow, resulting in a $113 billion Zillow visitor TAM. \r\nCutting that down to just shoppers who raise their hands on Zillow, meaning they proactively request to connect with one or more of our services. We estimate, first, a $16 billion opportunity made up of brokerage referral, mortgage, closing and other homebuyer-related transaction fees associated with those high-intent buyers. This is low-hanging fruit buy side TAM, not just people visiting our site, but actual buyers actively engaged in seeking to do business with us. \r\nAdditionally, on the sell side, we have good line of sight on an estimated $14 billion of sell side TAM derived from our increasing opportunity to capture more sell-side referral fees and listing marketing budgets from those agents already actively engaged in our funnel. This adds up to a current accessible $30 billion for sale revenue opportunity with high-intent, hand-raising consumers already in Zillow's funnel. \r\nToday, we capture $1.5 billion of that $30 billion accessible TAM. That $1.5 billion is our reported 2023 residential and mortgages revenue. Measured as a fraction of TTV, we stood at a mere 7 basis points in 2023. Oh my, so much blue ocean. \r\nOur position as one of the largest Internet brands in the United States, alongside iconic brands such as Facebook, Spotify and Netflix, gives us confidence that we have many years of growth into that $30 billion of revenue TAM accessible in our funnel today. Over the last 15-plus years, we've released a constant stream of novel engaging and practical product innovations, which is how great brands are created. Zillow brand has over 60% unaided brand awareness amongst shoppers, which is rare for a brand to achieve in any category. \r\nOkay. That is, of course, internal survey data, but you can see a good impartial proxy for this strength in our Google search activity, where Zillow is searched more on Google than the category term \"real estate\" and 3x more than our nearest competitor's brand. Further evidence of our brand strength is seen in our traffic composition. About 80% of Zillow's traffic is organic as well as in our app usage, which is more than 3x our nearest competitor. \r\nWe pioneered mobile real estate shopping with our leading iPhone and Android apps. And when Apple first launched the iPad, the Zillow app was highlighted by Steve Jobs on stage at the launch event. Taking things full circle this month, we partnered with Apple once again for the launch of Zillow Immerse on the new Apple Vision Pro, to offer mover consumers an interactive and immersive way to explore Listing Showcase listings with special technology. \r\nTry it. It's early, but it's an extraordinary home touring experience. We have been and will continue to be the company that is on the leading edge of utilizing technology to create magical new consumer and agent experiences. \r\nSo I've laid out a more refined view of the opportunity as we see it: quite large, quite complex, quite accessible for us. We monetize very little of it today, yet it's in our store. I've also outlined the reasons to believe that Zillow can and will tap this $30 billion accessible TAM: one, we have the leading audience brand and engagement; two, we have proven technology and product talent that is unrivaled in the real estate industry; three, we have built an extensive, talented and increasingly integrated partner network; and four, we have a strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to pursue current and future growth opportunities. For these reasons, we are uniquely well positioned to transform and replatform the largest industry in the country. \r\nWe spent the last 2 years building the integrated transaction experience and testing it in enhanced markets. Now it's time to press down on the accelerator to increase our breadth of coverage across more markets and our depth of penetration in those markets. We made a great deal of progress in 2023. We will make more in 2024. \r\nOkay. I've talked about our opportunity and our vision for the future of real estate. Now I will pass the microphone over to our COO, Jeremy Wacksman, to give you a more detailed progress report and where we are headed.\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rich said, Zillow's housing super app is the container into which we are continually adding upgrades and improvements, guided by 5 for sale growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services. Our for sale growth pillars marked the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow our revenue alongside that transaction share growth. You'll note that we've also added rentals as an additional growth pillar this quarter. We're excited about the opportunities here as our rentals marketplace continues to accelerate and accounted for nearly 20% of Zillow's total revenue in 2023. \r\nI'll kick off our growth pillar update with touring. The investments we're making here continue to drive our industry outperformance. When a customer raises her hand to look at a home she's been coveting on Zillow, it's a strong signal of serious intent to transact. As we work to convert more visitors on our site into transactors, the home tour remains a critical focus area for us. Touring has historically been painful for both movers and agents. So we've invested in making the process more seamless than it's ever been. Our real-time touring product powered by ShowingTime is meaningfully improving our ability to connect high-intent customers to our Premier Agent partners. \r\nWe ended Q4 with our real-time touring product, delivering approximately 10% of our total connections. We expect to expand our breadth of coverage by launching additional markets and increase our depth by growing real-time touring to account for approximately 20% of connections by the end of 2024. This is driving a better customer and agent experience with less friction as we see increased successful connections and more customers working with agents. \r\nEqually as important as touring is financing. And as a reminder, approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage, and 80% of those buyers don't yet have an agent. Knowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow positions us well to build a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage business that is seamlessly integrated with our extensive Premier Agent partner network. By integrating Zillow Home Loans with our Premier Agent partner network, we are creating a better customer experience from the start of the home-buying journey on Zillow to when a customer moves into that brand-new home. \r\nAnd it's clear that customers and partners are increasingly enjoying this integrated housing super app experience. Most notably, our efforts are driving purchase mortgage growth. In our original 4 enhanced markets, we saw our customer adoption rates climb from 6% to 15% over the course of 2023. Since Q1 2023, the percentage of purchase mortgages in which a customer works with a Premier Agent partner increased from 23% to 53%. \r\nAll of this success translates to $487 million in purchased loan origination volume this quarter, a more than 100% year-over-year increase despite a very challenging mortgage rate environment. We expect continued mortgage growth as we follow our road map to 2025, expanding integration with Premier Agent partners, rolling out more enhanced markets and converting more high-intent customers on Zillow. \r\nI'll now move on to seller services, honing in on Listing Showcase. Listing Showcase elevates agents' brand presence on Zillow and helps them win more listings. Our AI-powered Listing Showcase also improves the shopper experience through listings that are powered by our home-grown rich media and floor plan technology. This is a unique differentiator in the marketplace and a significant benefit to buyer engagement and experience. \r\nWe are in the early days of this product, having launched in Q3, but it is clear already there is significant demand from listing agents and significant engagement with consumers. Listing Showcase listings received 68% more page views, 66% more saves, 63% more shares. We are actively rolling out Listing Showcase nationwide, with the intermediate-term goal of 5% to 10% listing coverage, which represents a $150 million to $300 million annual revenue opportunity. And we believe there is potential future growth beyond that. \r\nMoving on to our next growth pillar update, enhancing our partner network. Our mandate here is simple, help the best agents provide better service to more of our shared customers to grow their businesses and our business. And we are doing this in a few ways. First, we're expanding our enhanced market partners, increasing our depth of coverage in existing markets and our breadth by growing our enhanced market footprint from 9 at the end of 2023 to a projected 40 markets by the end of 2024. \r\nSecond, we're working to deliver the integrated experience between ZHL and Premier Agent. As a result, 1 and 2 Premier Agent partners in our enhanced markets are now introducing their customers to Zillow Home Loans, and that's up from 1 in 5 at the end of 2022. Lastly, we are excited to accelerate improvements to Follow Up Boss and make it available to more agents to increase conversion. With the power of Follow Up Boss, our Premier Agent partners will be better equipped than ever to deliver the best possible customer experience while supercharging their businesses. We think these efforts across the board will drive transaction conversion to help close the gap on the vast majority of Zillow connections that transact elsewhere and better cap the $30 billion accessible revenue TAM that Rich walked you through. \r\nMoving on to our last for sale growth pillar update: integrating our services. Doing this requires us to pull together consumer, agent and loan officer technology in one place, Zillow, to create an end-to-end experience that carries the customer through the entire transaction process with more transparency and ease. It's no small feat, but it's what consumers want, and we're in the best position to deliver it to them. As evidenced by our performance in our earliest 2 enhanced markets, Phoenix and Atlanta, our integrated strategy is working to drive customer transaction share gains. Since the beginning of 2022, our customer transaction share has grown more than 80%. Additionally, across our entire set of 9 enhanced markets, we are seeing consistent outperformance in connections growth versus the industry. This gives us great confidence to further expand our enhanced market footprint more rapidly in 2024. \r\nAs we expand to our projected 40 enhanced markets by the end of 2024, our integration within those markets is going to cover 20% of total Zillow connections by the end of the year. We land in each market with a subset of partner and customer coverage and work to expand our product offerings across the market over time. We are seeing share gains that will move the needle as we roll out more enhanced markets throughout the year into 2025. \r\nI'll wrap up with a progress update on rentals. Rentals is a fast-growing business with a big opportunity in front of it. Nearly every homebuyer starts out as a renter, and providing our customers with optionality is as important as ever in a challenging housing market. Today, we have the largest audience of renters and the most listings in the market, with limited marketing spend to date. We're now leveraging our position as traffic leader to grow our multifamily properties, which has accelerated our multifamily revenue growth year-on-year from 14% in Q4 2022 to 52% in Q4 2023. As we look to serve more of this market and grow revenue, we plan to expand the number of multifamily properties and deliver a superior experience for our rentals partners. \r\nBefore handing it over to Jeremy Hofmann, I do want to highlight that while we've been building these past few years, we've meaningfully outperformed a challenged housing market. For full year 2023, Zillow reported over $1.9 billion in revenue, outperforming the real estate industry by 1,600 basis points. I'm grateful to our teams who have been working hard to bring Zillow's housing super app to life over the last 2 years, solving real customer pain points with exceptional tech solutions and partners. We are looking forward to continued growth in the years ahead. \r\nWith that, I will now pass the line over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nThanks, Jeremy, and hello, everyone. As you heard from Rich and Jeremy, we are pleased with how we've executed on our strategy, and we are starting to see those efforts show up in our financial results. despite a persistently challenging housing macro backdrop. In my comments today, I will cover our Q4 results, our outlook for Q1 and some early thoughts on 2024 to help you all understand how we expect the year to play out as well as the financial philosophy that underpins how we will manage the business moving forward.\r\nI will start with our Q4 2023 results, which exceeded expectations across the board. Revenue growth accelerated in Q4, up 9% year-over-year to $474 million, which was more than $31 million above the midpoint of our outlook range. Revenue outperformance was driven by acceleration across each of our revenue lines for residential mortgages and rentals. On a GAAP basis, Q4 net loss was $73 million, representing 15% of our revenue. EBITDA was $69 million for the quarter. When excluding the impact of a $14 million onetime expense related to the partial lease termination of our Seattle office space, EBITDA would have been $83 million, resulting in an 18% EBITDA margin and marking a return to positive year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion. The combination of our revenue outperformance and effective cost management delivered the improved year-over-year EBITDA results despite a macro housing environment that remains constrained. \r\nGoing a click deeper, the partial lease termination option for our Seattle office space, which we previewed on our last earnings call, was exercised in December. As a result, we estimate our 2024 facilities costs will decrease by $8 million and we will release an estimated $37 million in EBITDA expenses in total over the remaining life of the Seattle lease, which more than makes up for this onetime expense impacting our Q4 EBITDA. \r\nReturning to more details on the quarter. Our Q4 residential revenue of $349 million outperformed our outlook range and revenue growth accelerated to 3% year-over-year. Our residential revenue performance was 700 basis points above the industry decline of 4%, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. We believe our Q4 outperformance was primarily driven by our ongoing investments in our top of funnel and mid-funnel experiences that continue to drive improvements in our overall lead volumes. \r\nRentals revenue growth accelerated in Q4, with revenue increasing 37% year-over-year to $93 million, primarily driven by our multifamily revenue, which grew 52% year-over-year in Q4. Our rentals strategy is working well, and our team is executing on growing the number of multifamily properties on our apps and sites, which reached an all-time high of 37,000 multifamily properties as of year-end. Total listings across our entire rentals marketplace were also up 40% year-over-year to an industry-leading 1.7 million listings. \r\nMortgages revenue of $22 million in Q4 returned to positive growth, up 22% year-over-year, with purchased loan origination volume growing 105% year-over-year. We are executing on our mortgage strategy to help more of our customers get financing through Zillow Home Loans. The tools and integration capabilities we have built are creating a bridge between Premier Agent partners, ZHL loan officers and our buyer customers, which is why we are seeing more than 50% of funded loans across all markets coming from customers working with our Premier Agent partner. This was a critical puzzle for us to solve before expanding more rapidly in 2024, and we are pleased with the progress to date. \r\nEBITDA expenses in Q4 totaled $405 million. Excluding the onetime partial lease termination expense I mentioned earlier, EBITDA expenses would have totaled $391 million, roughly flat sequentially from Q3 and at the low end of our outlook range as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Cost of revenue increased $26 million or 29% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in website development costs as we continue to test and release new products. \r\nWe ended the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments, down from $3.3 billion at the end of Q3. This includes the benefit of net cash provided by operating activities, the impact of $88 million in share repurchases during Q4, the impact of $56 million towards convertible debt repurchases below par, and the approximately $400 million closing cash purchase price, a follow-up loss. Post repurchases of convertible debt in the quarter, we have $1.6 billion of principal outstanding. \r\nBefore turning the page to 2024, I want to highlight how pleased I am with our execution throughout the entirety of 2023. We accelerated revenue growth from a decrease of 13% year-over-year in Q1 to an increase of 9% year-over-year in Q4. When combining the revenue growth with a disciplined approach to our cost structure, we feel well positioned entering this year.\r\nTurning to our outlook for Q1. I first want to level set on what we expect for existing homes' total transaction value. We estimate total transaction value to be between a decline of 4% to up 1% year-over-year in Q1. With that as a backdrop, we expect total company revenue to be between $495 million to $510 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 7% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be between $365 million to $375 million, up 2% year-over-year at the midpoint of our outlook range. \r\nDespite the tough macro existing home sales environment, we expect our residential revenue to outperform the industry in Q1 as our growth pillars begin to contribute to revenue and the investments we have made in our overall funnel continue to deliver benefits. We expect rentals revenue to continue to grow more than 30% year-over-year in Q1 as we benefit from the strength of our execution and favorable industry backdrop driving landlord demand for advertising. We expect positive growth in mortgages revenue year-over-year in Q1. We plan to expand integration with our Premier Agent partners in enhanced markets, send more of our mortgage lease to ZHL directly and drive engagement with more consumers on our apps and sites to grow our origination volumes. \r\nFor Q1, we expect EBITDA to be between $95 million and $105 million, implying a 20% margin at the midpoint of our outlook range. This implies EBITDA expenses will increase from the $391 million in Q4 that excludes the lease termination expense. The increase is being driven by 3 primary factors: one, we take on a full quarter of operating costs for Follow Up Boss; two, there is an annual increase in payroll taxes that occurs every Q1; and three, we are staffing up variable headcount for sales given the growth we expect in 2024 from rentals, Listing Showcase and Zillow Home Loans. \r\nMoving on to 2024 as a whole. We want to provide some color for how we expect the year to play out based on the information we have today. First, we are currently assuming that the housing market is relatively flat in aggregate for the year. With that as a backdrop, we expect to drive double-digit revenue growth for the full year, implying accelerated year-over-year revenue growth throughout the year from the high single digits in Q1 that I've discussed in our outlook. \r\nAs we increase the breadth and depth of our products and services throughout the year, we expect our growth pillars will drive the vast majority of the revenue growth across our business in 2024. More specifically, in our residential revenue category, we expect continued market outperformance as we expand touring, make top-of-funnel improvements, integrate Follow Up Boss into our sales motions and expand the rollout of Listing Showcase. I will note that we expect the revenue contribution from Follow Up Boss to be a low single-digit percentage of our total company revenue in 2024. \r\nIn rentals, we expect continued strong growth as we increase our multifamily properties and total listings. In mortgages, we expect Zillow Home Loans' integration with Premier Agents and our enhanced market expansion to drive meaningful growth. On the cost side, we believe our fixed investments are at the right level, which should result in our fixed costs growing modestly with inflation and our variable costs growing with or slightly ahead of revenue initially as we ramp up new hires to be fully productive. \r\nWhen combining our expected revenue growth and cost discipline, we expect modest EBITDA margin expansion for the full year. Beyond our revenue and EBITDA expenses, share-based compensation expense is an area of focus for us. We expect the absolute dollars of 2024 share-based compensation expense to be lower than 2023, and we expect to leverage SBC as a percentage of revenue from the combination of lower absolute dollars in SBC expense and projected revenue growth.\r\nStepping back from our Q4 results, Q1 outlook and 2024 early thoughts, I want to discuss the financial philosophy we have as a company as we execute on our go-forward strategy. As you heard from both Rich and Jeremy, Zillow today is a much different business from what it was several years ago. Our revenue base has diversified to the point where a majority of our revenue is now derived from sources other than buy side fees. We have growth pillars we are executing against and are excited about, with a $30 billion for sale revenue opportunity accessible in our funnel today. As we continue to execute on our growth pillars, while controlling fixed costs and gaining leverage on share-based compensation expense, we expect to deliver operating leverage resulting in strong GAAP profitability over time.\r\nBeyond our organic investments, we have made several acquisitions to accelerate our growth pillars. For example, we acquired ShowingTime in 2021, which accelerated our launch of real-time touring. Since then, we acquired 2 real estate media businesses, VRX and Aryeo, to scale ShowingTime+'s Listing Showcase product with both first-party and third-party photographers. We also acquired Spruce, a tech-enabled title and closing business to add to our housing super app experience over time. \r\nAnd most recently, we acquired Follow Up Boss to create a best-in-class CRM for our Premier Agents and the industry. M&A is not our core strategy. However, we will continue to pursue selective opportunities when we find ways to accelerate our growth pillars. Beyond our day-to-day operating philosophy, we have been active in deploying capital over the past several years, returning $1.7 billion to shareholders since the beginning of our stock repurchase program in Q4 2021. And we plan to continue to be opportunistic with the program going forward. Last, we remain focused on retiring our outstanding convertible debt. In 2023, we repurchased a total of $58 million in principal of our 2025 notes. We now have $1.6 billion of convertible senior notes, which we may opportunistically redeem if they become callable.\r\nTo close, I'll reiterate what you have heard from us before. 2022 was a year where we restrategized and reorganized around our housing super app vision. 2023 was a year for us to release new products and tests in various markets, setting us up for more depth and more breadth in 2024 and 2025. We are clearly executing on our strategy and look forward to sharing more updates throughout 2024. \r\nAnd with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from John Campbell with Stephens.\n\nJohn Robert Campbell\n\nFor the gains, I just wanted to start -- maybe if we could start on the share gains. You guys are obviously using total real estate revenue, I guess, as a basis of comparison versus the industry. I know you guys aren't directly reporting on Premier Agent, but if we can maybe below the surface just isolate that for now. But my question is, what's the growth initiatives you have in place? And then obviously, the flex pricing changes, would you expect to see a similar rate or maybe even greater degree of outperformance versus the national market just over the balance of the year and maybe even in the next?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nJohn, this is Jerry Wacksman. I think the way we think about it is the share gains that we gave out this quarter the 2 most mature markets over that 2-year period helped show the path or what you should expect to see as we roll out more enhanced markets, right? As a reminder, those were the ones where we had great year-over-year data and enough time for the cohort to mature. And then as I said earlier, the 9 markets that we're in now, we're seeing connections growth that out -- that grows faster than the industry, which is a great leading indicator for share gains. \r\nSo that's why we're so confident in getting from 9 to what will be 40 by the end of 2024. And as we build the depth with more partners to offer the services to more customers in those markets, you should expect to see similar share gains from the set of customers and partners that we're working with in those markets.\n\nJohn Robert Campbell\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up. I'm sure you guys are bracing for this question. But on the CoStar media blitz, if you will, obviously, spending, I guess, we'll find out soon how much this year, but it seems like a lot I think the burning question with a lot of investors is, will you guys respond? Will this be something that requires you guys to maybe up your brand investment spend? Maybe if you could talk to that. I know you guys have called out the 80% organic traffic, which is a pretty important number, but maybe if you could just shed some light on that?\n\nRichard N. Barton\n\nOkay, John. Yes, this is Rich. So I guess I'd start off by saying we're not currently seeing any impact from this spend nor the buildup to the spend. As really Jeremy Hofmann discussed, our numbers are great. Our progress versus our growth pillars is great, and we really like our go-forward growth plan to expand our super app to more markets, as Jeremy Wacksman was just talking about, and all this culminated. Jeremy Hofmann gave his 2024 soft guidance on revenue growth to double digits with this -- with the competitive context in mind. And so that's how we feel things are going to develop. \r\nTo your specific question -- or do you think we'll need to change anything? We are a company that believe as we think about our marketing mix, we think about it very broadly. We are technologists in our DNA. We are product builders, the customers our North Star. We have always believed that the most important part of the marketing mix is the product itself. This has served us really well historically. It is what has put us in the position we are in today of being the traffic leader, the brand leader, the engagement leader. \r\nAnd it's put us in a strategic position that is highly differentiated from anybody else in the industry. We are really trying to digitize the whole of the transaction. We're trying to replatform this whole industry. We're trying to integrate it all into the same Zillow housing super app. This is difficult stuff. It is highly differentiated, and we believe this is what ensures that we win long term.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brad Erickson with RBC.\n\nBradley D. Erickson\n\nI guess just first on real-time touring in the markets where you've had some time to see how it plays and appreciate those charts in the presentation. What would you say are kind of like the main friction points and then time frame that lie kind of between an agent getting -- starting to get those new higher quality leads and then choosing to lean in with their spend? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes, Brad, on real-time touring, it is a mix of eligibility with both the consumer and the agent and the listing, right? It's like all 3 things. And so we're really pleased with how real-time touring has gone. And I think you heard earlier, we talked about getting from 10% of connections currently to 20% by the end of 2024, and that's through a mix of going broader into more markets, but also going deeper in those markets with both customers and agents. \r\nAnd then on your specific question on the sort of agent partnering with the buyer, what we tend to find as we talk about this enhanced market strategy is when we start to work with these enhanced partners on the whole basket of services, real-time touring, Zillow Home Loans, seller services, increasingly Follow Up Boss. This becomes a much broader conversation around how to help them grow and operate their business better in service of our customers. And so it is one part of the overall playbook we work with. Of course, it's a really important one because these are incredibly high-value, high-intent customers who want to go see a house right now. And so the feedback on the reception continues to be really positive when they get a chance to work with those buyers. \r\nBut if you remember, we've talked a lot about how this is a new workflow for those agents as well. And many times, they have to build new muscle with their teams, with their team leads, with their individual agents to help service those customers to really provide that delightful experience that we're creating for the customers. So when it works, it's really magical because the consumer gets what they want different from anything else in the industry. But to your point, it really is a new training mechanism, which is why we've been so methodical in testing and iterating on it in the markets we've been in.\n\nBradley D. Erickson\n\nGot it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on Follow Up Boss. Can you just give a little more detail there, just kind of on the unlock of the synergies you guys are going after within the PA business? And then just any integration costs for investment embedded there? Any color on that would be great.\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. Maybe I'll start on the strategy, and Jeremy, you can hit costs. The strategy for Follow Up Boss, as Jeremy Hofmann said, is really twofold, right? One, it's help make what is already one of the best CRMs in the industry even better, right, give them oxygen and the ability to accelerate the road map of features and services that they have. And then secondly, it's to help introduce Follow Up Boss to more customers. So it's already the most popular CRM with our Premier Agents, but many of our Premier Agents don't yet use it. And obviously, many agents industry-wide don't yet use it, so helping them grow and attract more agent customers is the second part. \r\nWhen we do both those things, that rising tide is going to lift all boats, it's going to lift the Zillow transaction boat, right? And our agents working with the Zillow customers are going to be able to perform better, be more responsive satisfy the customer better and convert more, and you'll see that in conversion increases. So that's really the strategy. \r\nMaybe I'll turn it over to you for cost. The only thing I'll add on cost is we're really excited to help them accelerate their road map. They had great plans in place already and the acquisition just closed in December. So we're still early in our planning.\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes. It's Jeremy Hofmann. I'll reiterate what Jeremy Wacksman just said. It is early, right? So I highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're having -- we're seeing the first quarter of full cost to Follow Up Boss early in integration. I wouldn't say that there's outsized investment at this moment, but definitely really pleased with the product road map they have and the opportunity we have to really help them accelerate from here as we integrate them into our sales motions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\n\nOkay. Two questions, please. This sort of outperformance, I think you said it was about 700 bps of outperformance versus the residential market. I think you had first guided the 400 bps. So just explain why you think you've been able to outperform. I know you've been doing it for a while, but maybe you outperformed a little bit more than you had expected in the quarter. And just how should we think about or how do you think about how your level of outperformance versus the market goes into this next year, into '24? \r\nAnd then I want to switch and ask you about costs. And get back to this question of if you're going to keep fixed costs fixed to this $1.1 billion and variable costs get leverage against it at that $400 million level and how long do you think you can sustain that for. You've been talking about it for a couple of quarters. It sounds like you're giving in a little bit on the variable cost, showing a little bit of deleverage first before leverage. But just, is that framework still going to hold for you that you can keep that fixed cost at $1.1 billion and variable at $400 million and getting leverage against that over time?\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes. So it's Jeremy Hofmann, Mark. I'll take the second one first. On the cost structure, we feel -- continue to feel really good. So the fixed cost base, we expect to get leverage on over time. We feel like we're at the right levels right now. It will grow with inflation a bit, but generally at the right levels, and that's really with an eye towards our year-end 2025 targets on customer share gains. And we feel like we're well invested on the fixed side. \r\nAnd then on the variable side, you're right, over time, we will get leverage, of course. And Listing Showcase, and rentals, and ZHL, we see really exciting growth opportunities, and we're staffing up sales ahead of that. That will take a little bit of time to ramp to get people fully productive, but over time, of course, get leverage there, and we're looking for efficiencies across the entire cost base always. So feel really good there. \r\nAnd then on the outperformance side, I'd say Q4 was about as expected, and we're really pleased with the outperformance across all of 2023. We don't overfocus on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, just given how fluid macro has been and will continue to be. But I think 2023 was a great year for us. We accelerated revenue from Q1 to Q4. Total company revenue outperformed housing by 1,600 basis points. And then we've had 6 straight quarters of outperformance in residential as well. And we expect more of the same in 2024. \r\nI alluded to it in my prepared remarks, but we expect to grow double digits in 2024 against the flattish housing market. And then to double-click further into that, we expect acceleration throughout 2024 with a lot of that acceleration coming from our growth pillars as we get into more markets and go deeper into existing markets. And when I look across our enhanced markets are going to go from 9 to 40, covering 20% of all connections. \r\nReal-time touring, we think, is going to go from 10% of all connections to 20% of all connections. Showcase is really starting to sell broadly in January, and we expect that revenue to build throughout the course of the year. And then rentals is executing really, really well. We're expecting to see 30%-plus growth again in Q1. And ZHL will grow alongside market expansion and more consumption of mortgage leads. So just across the business, it feels like we're really well set up for 2024 as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman Associates.\n\nRyan McKeveny\n\nCongrats on the progress. Curious if you can talk about Listing Showcase. I guess just reception to date between what are Premier Agents and let's call the non-Premier Agents, and I ask because within the slide deck and kind of the opportunity ahead of getting to 5% to 10% share of listings seems to suggest plenty of opportunity, both for Premier Agents and kind of cross-selling the Listing Showcase product and non-Premier Agents. So anything you can share with us to date. Obviously, knowing it's small at this point in time, but yes, how that's going so far and how you think about that balance and opportunity between kind of cross-selling in the PA side of things versus new agents that don't currently partner with Zillow.\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. Happy to. I mean you're right. It is early, and Listing Showcase having just launched in Q3 and we're just now flipping to national. But in the early signal, there's lots of signal. And as I talked about, the agent response has been really positive. I think folks are seeing it as a tool to market themselves and win more listings as well as market the listings. And then, of course, that provides us benefit to our buyer experience that results in the higher engagement with page view saves and shares, we shared some of the data on. \r\nWe are seeing success with both Premier Agents and non-Premier Agents in the markets we've been in and as we've continued to take it to more markets and we expect that to continue. And that's what gives us excitement for the intermediate-term target we shared with you all going from what is less than 1% of listings today to 5% to 10% of total active listings at some point here in the future. And we think there's growth and opportunity beyond that. \r\nScale in this business requires solving a bunch of operational complexity. The team has been hard at work doing, as Jeremy Hofmann talked about, it required a bunch of media investments. It requires a bunch of partner operations that the team has worked hard to get right, and we're now benefiting from the fruits of a lot of that investment as we take this nationwide. \r\nSo it is still early. We'll share more as we learn from being in more markets with a larger set of partners, but we're really pleased with the response and the progress and the ability to work with just great agents, whether they are existing Premier Agents or this is their way into working with Zillow for the first time is an exciting opportunity for Listing Showcase. And it's something we're seeing.\n\nRyan McKeveny\n\nThat's helpful. And one on ZHL. So the purchase volume growth kind of speaks for itself. But I think it implies market share-wise in the purchase origination business, close to a doubling in just the last 2 quarters alone. So obviously, good progress there. I guess I'm curious on the comments you made about going from 23% to 53% of customers that are also working with the PA. Is that a combination of the 2 kind of connection approaches you've talked about in the past being property first and financing first? Is that kind of a mix of both PA coming back to you and you going to PA? And just any commentary on whether it's one of those approaches meaningfully driving things or if it's a combination of both moving in the right direction.\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes, it's a good question. The short answer to your last question is it's both. And I think the reason why it's both, it's important to remember sort of why mortgage for the customer and for Zillow, right? And yes, we all know 80% of homes are financed with a mortgage, but it is more importantly that 40% of homebuyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage. And so that's why we talk so much about most consumers either want to go see the house and book a tour, ideally with real time touring, or they want to figure out what they can afford, which Zillow Home Loans can help them with. \r\nUltimately, they need to go through both those experiences. And whichever door they start with, they need to use a great agent and they need to get a mortgage to get the house done. And so it really is a contribution of both those things that's driving that 23% to 53%. And that's why we're so excited about the opportunity to grow and deliver that integration to more customers in more of these enhanced markets as we scale this recipe. \r\nAnd that really does speak to the strong customer acquisition cost advantage, we think we have at Zillow, the majority of those customers, as Rich talked about, are already on Zillow, and many of them are already going through one of those doors. And so helping them understand and get what they need to use more of our services to get the house transaction done, right, that's a great business for us. \r\nBut ultimately, as Rich said, it's what the consumer wants. It's what they need to be able to buy the house. So that's why we're so excited about mortgage. Yes, you're right, we're seeing over 100% year-over-year growth in purchase mortgage origination volume, and we expect growth to continue in 2024 as we continue to scale the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.\n\nThomas Steven Champion\n\nRentals growth is really strong, and it sounds like multifamily is driving a lot of that. The business has been around for a while. I'm just curious kind of the timing and why now that it's become kind of so large and picked up so much momentum. And just curious if there's any comment on the single-room initiative, I think, that was announced recently?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes, Tom, I'll take both of those. I mean I think the why now is just the rental strategy that we've had in place for a while is working and it's working for both consumers and partners. We've had -- we have grown and have the largest audience in the category where we have the most renters coming to Zillow Group properties because we have the most listings, we have the most complete set of listings, which is really the #1 problem to solve for renters. \r\nAnd we're able to leverage that audience growth and engagement to really drive multifamily growth and start to work with more multifamily partners to bring their inventory online on to our properties. And that's why we see a lot of growth potential ahead of us for rentals. That's what's driven the meaningful growth throughout 2023. And as Jeremy Hofmann said, we expect that to continue into 2024. \r\nAnd then you specifically asked about the room for rent. Again, so for those who didn't see, we launched this week a new listing type, which is folks can post rooms for rent rather than entire places for rent, which is something that is increasingly common and prevalent across a lot of our rental markets. And we're really pleased with the early results there. \r\nWe just turned it on in the last couple of weeks. But that again speaks to the strategy of try and organize and provide the most services and experiences for the renter and all renter personas and segments and then help them figure out which door they need to get through and which subset of inventory they want and that drives then the benefit for our partners, for the folks who are trying to find the right renter, whether that is a big building or an individual single-family home.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today comes from Ron Josey with Citigroup.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nGreat. Just a quick follow-up on the rentals question right there. Just -- when you think about growth going forward, is that from the multifamily property growth of 37,000 and growing or the mix of single-family, multifamily and sort of offering everything to everyone, which given your audience, I'm assuming that's the case, but any insights on those 2? And then I think, Jeremy, you talked about staffing up in head count for sales, and you mentioned rentals and Listing Showcase and Zillow Home Loans. Talk to us a little bit more about just the maturity of the current sales force and how you -- where you're investing, I guess, across those newer areas like rentals, Showcase and ZHL?\n\nJeremy Wacksman\n\nYes. Maybe I'll start, and you can hit the staffing. I mean the short answer is it's going to be a mix of both. You're seeing, I would say, over-indexing growth from a revenue contribution standpoint in multifamily right now, but back to the strategy of the most complete set of listings. We do have both multifamily growth and longer tail, smaller inventory growth in terms of our rental manager and suite of products and services that are landlords and property managers use on that side. \r\nSo we're excited about both segments of supply driving not just audience growth and engagement but the business over time. But obviously, in the near term, you're seeing a faster acceleration in ramp on the multifamily side. In Q4, you saw that overindex, and I think you saw it in Q3 as well. And you should expect to see that early into next year as well. And then maybe on the various staff-ups, I don't know if you want...\n\nJeremy Hofmann\n\nYes, I can hit that. I mean I think it's natural at this point just given the evidence of traction that we have that we should be accelerating growth, and it's across all 3 of those. They all are doing quite well but have a lot of opportunity ahead of them. And we want to make sure we are well positioned from a sales staffing perspective to capture that growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude our Q&A session. So I would like to pass the conference over to Rich for any further remarks.\n\nRichard N. Barton\n\nThanks, Sierra, and thanks, everybody, for your questions. You've heard today about our tremendous progress that we've made over the past 2 years on our journey to transform and replatform this largest of industries. As we look ahead, we are pressing down on the accelerator, increasing the breadth and depth of our products and services across more markets as we tap into this $30 billion TAM that's already accessible, already raising their hands for help, already inside our store. We'd like to thank you again for being on this journey with us, and we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the months ahead. All right. Have a nice evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

        "content": "Zillow Group, Inc. ZG reported relatively healthy fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom line and the top line beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Growing user base, drop in monthly mortgage payments on home purchases and strategic acquisitions proved tailwinds despite stiff competition and higher expenditures.\n\nNet Income\n\nGAAP net loss in the quarter was $73 million or a loss of 32 cents per share compared with a net loss of $72 million or a loss of 31 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The marginal increase in losses despite higher revenues was due to higher operating expenses.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the company\u2019s net income declined marginally to $50 million or 20 cents per share from $52 million or 21 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents.\r\n\r\nFor 2023, Zillow witnessed a net loss of $158 million or a loss of 68 cents per share compared with a net loss of $101 million or a loss of 42 cents per share in 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported a net income of $319 million or $1.26 per share, down from $372 million or $1.43 per share in 2022.\n\nZillow Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nZillow Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Zillow Group, Inc. Quote\n\nRevenues\n\nFor 2023, total revenues declined 1% year over year to $1,945 million.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues increased to $474 million from $435 million as both residential and rental segments witnessed a top-line expansion from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $451 million.\r\n\r\nResidential revenues witnessed a 3% increase from $340 million in prior-year quarter to $349 million in fourth-quarter 2023.\r\n\r\nRevenues in the rental segment witnessed a 37% rise to $93 million from $68 million in the previous-year quarter. The expansion in rental revenues was driven by growth in both multi and single-family listings.\r\n\r\nThe mortgages segment generated $22 million in revenues compared with $18 million in the year-earlier quarter. Integration of Zillow Home Loans with their Premier Agent partners and increasing volume of purchase mortgage orientation led to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nDuring the quarter, Zillow recorded a gross profit of $359 million compared with $346 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is primarily due to healthy revenue growth in all the segments. The operating expenses during the quarter were $464 million, up from $429 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $69 million compared with $73 million a year ago.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn 2023, Zillow generated $354 million in cash from operating activities compared with $4,504 million in 2022. As of Dec 31, 2023, the company had $1,492 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $1,466 million a year ago.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Zillow estimates total revenues to be in the range of $495-$510 million. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $95 million to $105 million. In the Residential segment, the company anticipates revenues in the band of $365 million to $375 million.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nZillow currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

        "title": "Home shopping early may pay off as price cuts abound",
        "content": "Expensive, coastal and Western markets are already heating up as spring season approaches\n\nWell-priced homes are selling in 29 days, and that will shorten quickly as the shopping season opens. Mispriced inventory is lingering, however; an elevated 1 in 5 sellers are cutting prices to find buyers. New listings and total inventory are up slightly over last year, an encouraging sign for buyers.\n\nSEATTLE, Feb. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Both buyers and sellers should prepare for a competitive home shopping season this spring. The latest market report1 from Zillow\u00ae shows that well-priced homes are being snapped up quickly, while those that linger on the market are seeing their asking prices cut. Zillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"Some of the homes loitering on the market may just need the right buyer and digital curb appeal to cast a wider net, but many may be overpriced. There are slightly more homes for sale than this time last year, and there is still plenty of competition for well-priced houses,\" said Zillow Chief Economist Skylar Olsen. \"Buyers should prep their credit scores and sellers should prep their properties now \u2014 attractive listings are going pending in less than a month, and time on market will shrink in the weeks ahead.\"\n\nWhat buyers are seeing Just over 1 in 5 houses on Zillow saw a price cut in January \u2014 that's about equal to last year, but more common than in any of the five preceding years. Those cuts are bringing seller expectations more in line with the market conditions \u2014 the typical sold home was on the market for 29 days before going pending, while other homes lingered on the market for months, driving up the typical age of listings on Zillow to 72 days.\n\nShoppers already touring virtually and in person might be able to negotiate a deal on a house that's been waiting just for them. But that's likely not the case in places where median time on market for sold homes has dropped the most since last year: Las Vegas (down 32 days), Phoenix (30) and Seattle (28).\n\nStory continues\n\nSo where are the \"deals\" drying up and where are they plentiful? Price cuts are much less common than a year ago in expensive Western metros: Seattle, Las Vegas, Austin and San Jose.\n\nPrice cuts are most prevalent in Florida and Texas markets and in Phoenix. These are areas where total inventory is higher than before the pandemic \u2014 as in Austin and San Antonio \u2014 or where inventory declines are comparatively low.\n\nThere are a few more options available now than last year. Total inventory is up more than 3% from a year ago, while the flow of new listings to the market is up nearly 6%. January typically sees a significant jump in new inventory over December, and this year that monthly boost was 43%. Unfortunately \u2014 and in keeping with unimpressive Januaries over the past few years \u2014 that was a relatively small bump up.\n\nWhat sellers are seeing Sellers are still sitting pretty with record home equity. The typical U.S. home value is up nearly $100,000 since 2020, now standing at $344,159. Annual appreciation of 3.6% nationwide is fairly healthy, and only three of the 50 largest U.S. metros saw their home values fall over the year.\n\nMore than a quarter of homes sold for more than asking price in December, the most recent data available. That's fewer than in the rate-fueled real estate rush of the early pandemic, but slightly more than in December 2022 and far more than before the pandemic, when less than 20% of homes sold over list price.\n\nMetros where sellers are showing up much stronger than last year are San Diego, where new listings are up 28% annually, Miami (22%) and Riverside (20%).\n\nWhat to expect in coming months All this points to a relatively competitive home shopping season in which attractive listings are moving quickly. Demographic factors and a relatively strong economy mean vast numbers of millennials and baby boomers looking for houses, even while affordability is still extremely challenging.\n\nBuyers should get their credit in order, talk to a loan officer to understand their budget, and search by monthly payment to make sure their search results stay within their budgets, regardless of mortgage rate swings. Relevant down payment assistance programs are on every Zillow listing.\n\nFor sellers, it's important to work with an agent who understands local market conditions and will price their home correctly.

        "title": "The Super App is here \u2014 and it\u2019s called Zillow",
        "content": "zillow-lenders\n\nIn early 2022, real estate listing giant Zillow began discussing its visions for a \u201cHousing Super App.\u201d After initial confusion and skepticism over the app, Zillow\u2019s vision has slowly become clearer. On Tuesday, roughly two years since Zillow first announced it, the firm\u2019s CEO and co-founder Rich Barton said the Super App is here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Zillow,\u201d Barton told investors and analysts listening to Zillow\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call Tuesday evening. \u201cZillow is now the container into which we will continually place new features and services that work together seamlessly to solve real customer and partner pain points in their moves.\u201d\n\nWhile the full version of Zillow\u2019s Super App experience is currently only available in certain test markets, firm executives said that the company plans to expand its \u201cenhanced\u201d experience to a total of 40 markets nationwide by the end of 2024.\n\nCentral to Zillow\u2019s Super App vision has been its growth pillars, which now include rentals in addition to touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing its partner network and integrating its services.\n\n\u201cOur for-sale growth pillars mark the pathway to meeting our goals to grow customer transaction share from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025 and grow revenue alongside that transaction share growth,\u201d Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow\u2019s chief operating officer, said.\n\nAccording to Wacksman, in Zillow\u2019s first two enhanced markets, Phoenix and Atlanta, the firm\u2019s strategy of integrating the \u201cmoving experience\u201d (as Zillow refers to it) has resulted in its customer transaction share growing by more than 80% since 2022 in the two markets.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, across our entire set of nine enhanced markets, we are seeing consistent out performance in connections growth versus the industry,\u201d Wacksman said.\n\nFinancially, the transaction market share growth contributed to Zillow\u2019s 9% annual revenue gain for the fourth quarter of 2023, with revenue coming in at $474 million. For the full year 2023, Zillow reported a 1% annual decrease in revenue to $1.9 billion. Despite the relatively strong revenue numbers, Zillow still reported a net loss for both Q4 2023 and the full year 2023. In Q4 Zillow lost $73 million, slightly worse than the $72 million loss reported in Q4 2022. In all of 2023, Zillow lost $158 million, compared to a $101 million loss in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the lack of a profit, Zillow\u2019s executives still found reasons to be happy with their firm\u2019s financial performance. Executives highlighted strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter for Zillow\u2019s residential revenue (up 3% annually to $349 million), its rental revenue (up 37% annually to $93 million), and its mortgage revenue (up 22% annually to $22 million). The firm attributed the growth of its mortgage revenue to a 105% annual increase in purchase loan origination volume at Zillow Home Loans to $487 million.\n\n\u201cApproximately 40% of all home buyers start their journey shopping for a mortgage and 80% of those buyers don\u2019t have an agent yet,\u201d Wacksman said. \u201cKnowing that almost all of these mortgage seekers use Zillow positions us well to build a substantial direct consumer purchase mortgage business that is seamlessly integrated with our extensive Premier Agent partner network.\u201d\n\nIn addition to addressing the firm\u2019s financial performance and the ongoing evolution of its Super App vision, Zillow executives also addressed the commission lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe are monitoring the progress of numerous lawsuits facing several organizations within the industry,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe are confident in our ability to grow our company in this evolving climate.\u201d\n\nBarton also noted that Zillow is continuing to advocate for a marketplace that is transparent and fair for both agents and consumers, as well as equitable access to listings and information, independent buyer and seller representation, and the consumers\u2019 right to be informed on agent compensation and their right to negotiate that compensation. As an example of this advocacy work, Barton noted the Zillow-supported legislation in Washington state that requires buyer\u2019s agency agreements. The law went into effect at the start of 2024.\n\nWhile the future of the home-buying process remains a bit uncertain due to the ongoing litigation, Zillow executives said the company is well-prepared to ride out any storms.\n\n\u201cZillow today is a much different business from what it was several years ago,\u201d Jeremy Hoffman, Zillow\u2019s chief financial officer, said. \u201cOur revenue base has diversified to the point where a majority of our revenue is now derived from sources other than buy side fees. We have growth pillar we are executing against, and we are excited about a $30 billion for-sale revenue opportunity accessible in our funnel today.\u201d",

Excluding a one-time partial lease termination expense, Q4 Adjusted EBITDA would have been $83 million, or 18% of total revenue, up from 17% in Q4 of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023 was $391 million.\n\nCash and investments at the end of Q4 were $2.8 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of Q3.\n\nTraffic to Zillow Group's mobile apps and sites in Q4 was 194 million average monthly unique users, down 2% year over year.

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") financial measure.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\n\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the results of discontinued operations;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;\n\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the gain on extinguishment of debt;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and\n\nOther companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss for each of the periods presented (in millions, unaudited):\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nDecember 31, Year Ended \r\nDecember 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss: Net loss $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (73) $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(72) $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(158) $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(101) Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 13 Income taxes 3 4 4 3 Other income, net (43) (24) (151) (43) Depreciation and amortization  53 36 187 150 Share-based compensation  109 110 451 433 Impairment and restructuring costs 10 10 19 24 Acquisition-related costs 2 \u2014 4 \u2014 Gain on extinguishment of debt (1) \u2014 (1) \u2014 Interest expense 9 9 36 35 Adjusted EBITDA $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 69 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 73 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 391 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 514 Cision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-group-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-302061041.html\n\nSOURCE Zillow Group, Inc.",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 13, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Shopify SHOP, Zillow Group ZG and Blackline BL.\n\n3 Highly Ranked Tech Stocks to Watch as Earnings Approach\n\nThere will be a slew of top-rated stocks reporting earnings this week with several belonging to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list and being attractive tech companies to watch.\n\nReporting their fourth quarter results on Tuesday, February 13, here are three of these highly-ranked tech stocks that investors will want to keep an eye on.\n\nShopify\n\nMarket sentiment has been high for Shopify\u2019s potential as a provider of essential internet infrastructure for commerce. To that point, SHOP shares have soared +87% in the last year as the company\u2019s appealing growth narrative continues to take off.\n\nShopify\u2019s products for commerce and an expanding merchant base are expected to have driven its fourth quarter sales up 19% to $2.07 billion. More intriguing, Q4 earnings are projected to skyrocket 343% to $0.31 a share versus $0.07 a share in the comparative quarter. Shopify has eclipsed its top and bottom-line expectations for five consecutive quarters and strong Q4 results along with positive guidance could certainly extend the impressive rally in SHOP shares.\n\nZillow Group\n\nZillow is another internet platform that could be on the cusp of lofty expansion through its offering of real estate and home-related brands on the web and mobile. Fourth quarter results and guidance from Zillow will also give larger insight into the broader outlook of the housing industry and hopefully a rebound in the company\u2019s bottom line in fiscal 2024.\n\nWith that being said, Zillow\u2019s Q4 earnings are forecasted at $0.12 a share compared to $0.21 a share in a competitive prior-year quarter. Still, Q4 sales are projected to be up 3% to $450.75 million giving hope that Zillow could thrive upon easing inflation and lower rates.\n\nMore importantly, the busy home shopping season is near as the spring approaches and Zillow has surpassed its top and bottom line expectations for eight consecutive quarters. Even better, Zillow has posted an eye-catching average earnings surprise of 104.49% in its last four quarterly reports helping ZG shares rise a very respectable +23% over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackline\n\nLastly, Blackline is a provider of cloud-based solutions that centralize and streamline financial operations and other key finance and accounting processes. Blackline\u2019s growth prospects are very intriguing and may be overlooked at the moment with BL shares down -14% in the last year.\n\nHowever, Q4 sales are expected to be up 10% to $154.24 million with earnings anticipated to climb 57% to $0.55 a share compared to $0.35 per share a year ago. Interestingly enough, Blackline has surpassed top line estimates for 30 consecutive quarters and every quarter since the company went public in 2016. Blackline has beaten earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports and reconfirming its expansion and anticipation of double-digit EPS and sales growth in fiscal 2024 could very well lead to a rebound in BL shares.\n\nTakeaway\n\nMaking the prospects of these intriguing tech stocks more attractive is that earnings estimate revisions are up for their fiscal 2024 as they round out FY23 on Tuesday. This is a promising sign that Shopify, Zillow Group, and Blackline may be able to offer positive guidance and that it may be an ideal time to buy their stocks.\n\nZacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

        "title": "Renting alone? The 'singles tax' now exceeds $7,000",
        "content": "As the cost of independence rises, Zillow offers a fresh solution for those flying solo\n\nThe \"singles tax\" increased this year, now standing at $7,110. Cohabitating renters collectively save $14,220 annually on average by living together, but that can be as much as $40,200 in New York City. Zillow users can now list and search for individual rooms for rent, reducing housing expenses by finding a roommate to share costs.\n\nSEATTLE, Feb. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Zillow's latest findings reveal a steep \"singles tax\" that could dampen the spirits of solo dwellers. Renters braving the one-bedroom market on their own are now paying a premium of $7,110 per year to live alone, an increase of more than $100 from last year's already staggering figure.\n\nIn New York City, where personal space comes at a premium, singles still shoulder the most significant burden in the country for the luxury of living alone. According to data from Zillow's New York City brand StreetEasy, the additional annual cost for solo living has reached $20,100, a $600 increase from last year.\n\nConversely, cities like San Francisco, San Jose, Boston and Washington, D.C. have seen modest reductions in their singles tax. While these small declines provide a bit of financial breathing room, they don't mitigate the broader affordability challenges in major cities.\n\n\"While some renters may envy their coupled-up friends for dodging the singles tax, solo renters enjoy perks that go beyond financial savings. There's no arguing over which show to binge-watch next or disputes about whose turn it is to clean up after dinner,\" said Emily McDonald,\u00a0Zillow\u00ae rental trends expert. \"Still, it's crucial for renters to really dive into what living alone costs in their area and decide if the price tag is worth it.\" Singles Tax 2024\n\nZillow's analysis also reveals that cohabitating renters across the country enjoy annual savings of $14,220 over their solo-dwelling counterparts. The financial benefits of living together becomes even more pronounced in pricier cities, with couples in New York City seeing potential savings of $40,200. This considerable sum could be used to help erase credit card debt, invest in a retirement fund or contribute to a down payment on a home.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor singles looking to dodge the singles tax, embracing the roommate route presents a popular solution to keeping housing costs in check. Zillow recently rolled out room listings, aimed at alleviating the financial strain of living alone. This new listing type offers users the flexibility to both find and offer individual rooms for rent, seamlessly bridging the gap for those seeking a more budget-friendly living arrangement.\n\nAbout Zillow Group Zillow Group, Inc.
