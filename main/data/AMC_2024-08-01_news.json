        "title": "The Worst of the Worst: 7 Meme Stocks to Avoid at all Costs",
        "content": "There\u2019s a rotation going on the stock market.\n\nThe magnificent seven tech stocks and various AI names have started to dip in recent weeks. Meanwhile, long-forgotten smaller-capitalization and value stocks have begun to rally.\n\nThis shift in the market forces has reinvigorated a great number of meme stocks, with many names posting sharp rallies in July. But traders shouldn\u2019t get carried away with this move. These seven meme stocks to avoid remain on incredibly uneven footing and are likely to slump again later this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nWhen thinking of meme stocks to avoid, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) springs to mind.\n\nThe movie theater chain has been a leading arena for traders since 2021. AMC\u2019s bulls continue to hope for a tremendous short squeeze to lift shares to the heavens.\n\nUnfortunately, the company\u2019s poor fundamentals have squashed those hopes. Specifically, AMC\u2019s revenues only rebounded to $4.8 billion in 2023, leaving them well short of the $5.5 billion that the company brought in back in 2019. Factoring in the high level of inflation in the ensuing period, that\u2019s an especially poor result.\n\nAMC remains unprofitable and analysts see the company losing money in 2024 and 2025. And from 2023\u2019s relatively low revenue level, analysts see sales slipping this year amid a weak movie slate and lackluster consumer spending.\n\nWorst of all, shareholders have had to endure incredible dilution to fund AMC\u2019s operating losses. AMC\u2019s share count (adjusted for reverse splits) has risen from just 24 million shares in 2019 to 189 million shares now. It\u2019s hard for meme stock buying to offset that level of new share issuance in a company.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) can\u2019t hold a charge. The struggling hydrogen power firm has been in business since the 1990s. Despite having many chances to prove itself, the hydrogen fuel cell company seems farther from profitability than ever.\n\nPLUG stock has plunged more than 99% from its all-time highs. Despite a steady stream of press releases and new developments, little of it ever seems to amount to profitable business expansion. In fact, Plug Power lost money each of the past 10 years. Recently, the results have worsened. Plug Power lost more than $1 billion in 2023, and losses are\u00a0continuing to mount in 2024.\n\nTraders keep coming back to PLUG stock, seemingly in hopes of a short squeeze. The issue is, however, that Plug Power needs to unleash an unending stream of dilution on the market to keep funding its operating losses.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo that point, Plug Power\u2019s outstanding share count has soared from 159 million in 2014 to 595 million as of the most recent report. And it\u2019s about to go up yet again; PLUG stock sunk recently on news of another stock offering to raise money.\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) is a small technology company which is attempting to commercialize delivery robots.\n\nThe company is most known for its partnership with Uber\u2019s (NYSE:UBER) food delivery operation. The framework is in place for Serve to produce as many as 2,000 delivery bots for Uber to serve the Los Angeles market.\n\nHowever, SERV stock was not cooking up much excitement this year, with the stock lingering in the $2 range recently.\n\nAll that changed this week. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed that it purchased 62,500 SERV shares for $4 each, adding to a prior stake that it had obtained via a promissory note.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting that Nvidia involved, of course. But this transaction is chump change for a company of Nvidia\u2019s size, and the semiconductor company is known for taking equity positions in a variety of small start-ups. Investors should be exceedingly cautious with SERV stock given that shares have already quadrupled from recent levels and are now trading at a massive valuation.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SoundHound Inc.'s (SOUN) Headquarters exterior. The company develops voice-recognition, natural language understanding, sound-recognition and search technologies.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve been a long-time skeptic on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\nThe technology firm develops independent voice-driven artificial intelligence solutions. It has some exciting plans, and SoundHound signed up a credible client list.\n\nHowever, the issue is that SOUN stock doesn\u2019t appear to be particularly tied to its fundamentals. Rather the valuation has run far ahead of the underlying business. Like with Serve Robotics, it seems that traders are buying SoundHound primarily because Nvidia is an investor.\n\nSoundHound AI may eventually become a compelling business. But the firm generated just $11 million in revenues last quarter and is running large losses. That\u2019s nowhere near what\u2019s necessary to support the company\u2019s current $1.6 billion market cap.\n\nQuantumScape (QS) QuantumScape (QS) is an American company that develops solid state lithium metal batteries for electric cars.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantumScape (NASDAQ:QS) is a company that is attempting to commercialize a new solid-state battery model.\n\nYears ago, QS stock was one of the biggest winners of the SPAC boom, with shares rising tenfold at one point. However, a new battery technology takes a long time, from prototype to recurring revenues. Meanwhile, short sellers raised pointed questions about the company\u2019s underlying technology.\n\nThe latest issue for QuantumScape comes from politics. Former President Donald Trump has taken the lead in the polls, and his pick for vice president, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, has\u00a0proposed policies that could have massively negative ramifications for the battery and electric vehicle industries.\n\nQuantumScape popped higher recently on news of a further partnership with Volkswagen. But with analysts seeing minimal revenues through at least 2025 and QuantumScape being unprofitable for years, QS stock is a sell on all rallies.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantumScape isn\u2019t the only meme stock facing issues with a potential Trump presidency.\n\nIn fact, with Trump reportedly making an anti-electric vehicle stance a cornerstone of his campaign, the whole EV sector could come under fire.\n\nBigger players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may already have enough of a balance sheet, brand, and recurring cash flow base to endure an anti-EV administration. For a small struggling outfit like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), however, this could be a crippling blow.\n\nIn Q1, Lucid generated a modest $173 million in revenues, which rose only slightly from the $149 million it brought in during the same period of 2023. That growth rate simply isn\u2019t going to cut it, given that Lucid lost an eye-watering $730 million from operations last quarter alone.\n\nLCID stock popped 40% in recent weeks. It\u2019s time to dump this meme stock before a potential Trump presidency further weakens this EV firm\u2019s already tenuous competitive positioning.\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) Jumia (JMIA) logo on a cellphone with a flower\n\nSource: farzand01 / Shutterstock.com\n\nJumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) has long been pitched as the so-called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa.\n\nIn theory, that could be a highly appealing business. In practice, Jumia has struggled to turn that promise into reality. That are significant structural challenges in building an African e-commerce giant, such as lack of delivery infrastructure, limited free trade regions, and major language and cultural differences between countries.\n\nLong story short, Jumia\u2019s revenues were essentially dead flat between 2019 and 2023, almost entirely missing out on the recent e-commerce boom. Jumia continues to lose significant sums of money.\n\nJMIA stock has popped sharply following positive analyst coverage. That\u2019s not a bad thing, of course. But with Jumia shares up 300% year-to-date despite its middling fundamentals, this is a meme stock to sell now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Meme Mania Stocks: Which Are FOMO and Which Are Free Money?",
        "content": "Meme stocks, fueled by social media hype, can soar or crash rapidly. While some see potential for explosive gains, others pose a high risk. So, how to navigate this wild ride? Hot companies with strong fundamentals and a clear growth path might be worth a closer look, even if they have meme stock buzz.\n\nOn the other hand, companies with shaky finances or no concrete plan for future success are generally best avoided, regardless of online chatter. Ultimately, in-depth research beyond the memes is key to separating potential diamonds from the rough.\n\nWell, that\u2019s the general wisdom most rational investors should follow anyway. At the same time, influential traders like \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 continue to prove that some speculation may pay handsomely. That contradiction leaves most investors wondering what to do: chase what may be free money or end up another sad story burned by FOMO? Let\u2019s look at some of the most popular meme stocks and identify which of the two scenarios is more likely to occur.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock is FOMO and nothing else. While that\u2019s arguably true for most meme stocks, it\u2019s especially true for AMC.\n\nI say that because AMC\u2019s spikes in 2024 happen very quickly \u2014 over a few days at most \u2014 and then reverse course. Thus, once share prices rise, there\u2019s a rapid emergence of fear of missing out. That\u2019s a recipe for trouble and quick losses.\n\nI also think investors should avoid AMC for the same general reasons most analysts advise against it: The company isn\u2019t growing and continues to produce substantial losses. So, it\u2019s fundamentally weak. Furthermore, streaming is here to stay and AMC cannot compete with changing movie consumption tastes. Younger generations haven\u2019t grown up with the same movie-going experiences that existed decades ago. Preferences are shifting toward at-home streaming. That shift ruins the economics of movie theater operators like AMC.\n\nThat truth \u2014 combined with the short duration of meme price spike opportunities in AMC \u2014 makes it one to avoid overall.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) would be an easy stock to avoid if investing were simply an objective game. It isn\u2019t. Various subjective factors are always at play, and social media has fuelled those factors.\n\nSo, what I\u2019m trying to say here is simple. While GameStop\u2019s revenues are falling and EPS continues to move deeper into the negative, share prices are likely to rise soon. Blame politics and the polarization of everything through social media if you\u2019re looking for a scapegoat. But no matter how you feel about it, CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s recent tweets endorsing Trump in 2024 have the potential to spike share share prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven his previous positions regarding CEOs and political postings, are those tweets hypocritical? Absolutely.\n\nHave we also seen how powerful such tweets can be in moving speculative investments higher in the recent past? Also, \u2018yes\u2019. That\u2019s the nature of our world today, and it\u2019s a powerful reason to believe that GameStop could pop again as it aligns \u2014 or is aligned by its CEO \u2014 with the right.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf my hunch is right, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) will probably produce free money for investors in the coming weeks. It all relates to the relationship between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and SoundHound AI.\n\nThe reason for leaving SoundHound AI will move higher relates to the second quarter performance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. TSMC beat revenue and profit expectations upon releasing its Q2 earnings recently. That\u2019s a strong signal to the markets that the AI hardware boom remains in full swing. That\u2019s a strong signal that Nvidia will continue to be strong overall \u2013 and positive news in light of recent growing concern \u2013 as it is one of TSMC\u2019s most important customers.\n\nNvidia is an investor in SoundHound AI. We learned much more about that relationship earlier this year with the release of Nvidia\u2019s 13F filing. It indicated that voice recognition software has a huge potential growth market for found-use applications, from restaurant ordering to automotive. The point here is that investors will be looking at SoundHound again, as Nvidia should rebound on the positive news surrounding TSMC\u2019s Q2 earnings.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a meme stock to avoid, in my opinion. There are simply too many issues with the company to consider it a glass-half-full scenario.\n\nYes, consumer demand for the R1SUVuv continues to strengthen; however, investors must look beyond that and consider the bigger picture. Rivian reiterated 2024 production guidance in its June delivery announcement. Investors should continue to expect substantial losses and profoundly negative per-share earnings from Rivian in 2024 with sub-9% growth. There is no positive surprise on the horizon right now.\n\nRivian\u2019s net losses grew in Q1, approaching $1.5 billion. Those are not encouraging figures for investors. Remember, Rivian IPO\u2019d at $130 back in 2021. Shares now sell for $17. Shares have declined more than 21% year-to-date, even with a recent turnaround. Rivian is too risky, and it\u2019s better to err on caution.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme. Illustrative photo for news about Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat substitutes. BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) will certainly advance as the stock and company prospects worsen. The most recent news from the company is that it is in talks with bondholders about balance sheet restructuring.\n\nBonds are debt the company owes to various investor groups, and the restructuring talks indicate that Beyond Meat is in deep trouble. With this latest move, Beyond Meat\u2019s management is clearly signaling increasing bankruptcy risk. The company\u2019s cash burn issues and deep net losses are well known. The restructuring talks will only heighten fears that Beyond Meat is incapable of repaying its debts.\n\nThe simple fact is that Beyond Meat products have not been met with the demand anticipated by the company and investors earlier. Revenues fell 18% in the first quarter, exemplifying that truth. The news will create a short-selling opportunity, but there is no reason to expect share prices to rise reasonably soon.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) is at risk of bankruptcy, but if it can avoid that, I can see reasons to invest in the stock now.\n\nLet me just substantiate my first point about bankruptcy risk. ChargePoint Holdings has an Altman Z-Score of -1.92. That number indicates a possibility of bankruptcy in the next two years. That score isn\u2019t the only red flag for the company either. If ChargePoint Holdings can avoid bankruptcy, there are some real positives ahead.\n\nRevenues are expected to grow by nearly 27% in 2025, and losses should narrow substantially during the same timeframe. That expectation is prompted by rate cut expectations and a resurgent EV sector next year.\n\nSo, investing in CHPT shares might be free money right now. Top-line growth is expected to be even stronger in 2026, and ChargePoint is expected to begin producing per-share earnings at the same time. Those who jump in now and hold on might be setting themselves up for a good amount of free money.\n\nGinkgo Bioworks (DNA) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American biotechnology company Ginkgo Bioworks Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. DNA stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nGinkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) sounds like a deeply interesting company and potential investment. The company continues to promise to enable customers to program cells as easily as we program computers. It is building a platform for biotech partners to realize that dream, but the ambitious goal is fraught with real-world constraints.\n\nSynthetic biology is a complex field that tends to produce losses, as does the wider biotech sector. The company\u2019s problem is twofold. First, revenues that highly depend on sales of its synthetic biology platform continue to fall. Second, the company is nowhere near financial stability.\n\nThe company announced that it expects EBITDA breakeven by late 20rt. That\u2019s far away in most investors\u2019 eyes, never mind that EBITDA doesn\u2019t consider taxes, depreciation and amortization.\u00a0 The company is reducing labor costs by 25% at least. How is it expected to produce meaningful advancements in its platform? The answer is they\u2019re unlike, but that\u2019s the nature of balancing share prices and jobs at publicly listed firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Risky Stocks to Steer Clear of in 2024",
        "content": "Investing in the stock market is always a gamble, and some risky stocks present an unusually high level of volatility, potentially outweighing any possible returns.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq have reported excellent year-to-date (YTD) gains. However, this bullish outlook can mask underlying pitfalls in high-risk stocks that are unlikely to withstand turbulent markets.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s true that a short squeeze can temporarily boost these stocks, I believe this only defers the unavoidable fall. Investors need to cut through the noise and reevaluate their portfolios. In doing so, they need to ensure that their investments are built on solid long-term growth potential, not just fleeting market trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s examine three risky stocks in the market, evaluating the fundamental variables that contribute to their instability and why they could be better off being sold than held.\n\nRisky Stocks: AMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeavily shorted meme stocks often get a brief burst of excitement in the rallies, but they usually lag behind stable benchmarks over time. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is a clear example of this trend. Not long ago, the company saw a price bump in the hope of a market rebound, but it quickly faded away, dropping back to around $5 (as of now).\n\nThis volatility reveals major issues within AMC, starting with a massive $4.5 billion debt. Moreover, attendance numbers at AMC\u2019s U.S. theaters dipped severely by 5.8% to 30.5 million, dragging total attendance down by 2.1%. It\u2019s clear that AMC is nowhere near its pre-COVID peaks, and there is little to no chance of a rebound anytime soon.\n\nFinancially, AMC\u2019s revenue has slipped 0.3% year-over-year (YOY) to $951 million. As if that weren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s bracing for a weaker second quarter, partly blaming the film release delays due to strikes.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that AMC is struggling a lot, and it\u2019s only wise to avoid it.\n\nSolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) SolarEdge logo on phone with American flag background. SEDG stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few years, the solar industry has faced challenges from increasing borrowing rates, rising labor costs and regulatory developments. While some stocks thrive despite these challenges, unfortunately, SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG), a solar solution provider, hasn\u2019t been as fortunate.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. In Q1 of 2024, SolarEdge\u2019s revenue plummeted 78% YOY to $204.4 million. The bottom line was even bleaker, with a GAAP net loss of $157.3 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the stock nosedived after SolarEdge revealed that one of its customers, PM&M Electric, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. The $11.4 million owed by PM&M only adds to SolarEdge\u2019s financial problems and jeopardizes its stability.\n\nFurthermore, SolarEdge just launched a $300 million offering of convertible senior notes. That means they\u2019re raising funds by increasing their debt, which they\u2019ll have to pay back with interest. Since these notes can be converted into stock shares, they may water down the value of existing shares, thus affecting the current shareholders.\n\nGiven these factors, SolarEdge is clearly a risky bet, and investors should proceed cautiously.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) A photo of a futuristic-looking silver airplane.\n\nVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is running ahead of time by pioneering commercial space tourism, a field once considered science fiction. However, the company faces numerous challenges that question its long-term viability.\n\nSPCE has been rocked by a double whammy in the past few months. In March, SPCE took a hit when Boeing (NYSE:BA) filed a lawsuit for trade secret theft and breach of contract amounting to $26.4 million. Then, it also underwent a humiliating 1-for-20 reverse stock split to save its NYSE listing. This action resulted in a quick drop in its stock price following the announcement.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, while having $867 million in cash reserves, SPCE does not produce positive cash flows. Without a strategy change or sales increase, these funds could vanish, risking SPCE\u2019s existence in the high-stakes space sector.\n\nThe stock is already down 86% YTD, and the outlook indicates it will continue to decline.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If interested, read our recent piece on the 10 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy for Under $20.\n\nRetail investors often discuss their investments on platforms such as Reddit and have become a major market force in recent years. According to a report, inflows from retail investors in the stock market between 2014 and 2019 averaged around $200 million, with a peak of $730 million in 2015. The figure spiked to $1.2 billion in 2020, with daily flows reaching $1.48 billion in 2021. Over the next couple of years, the value of inflows hovered between $1-1.4 billion per day, driven by commission-free online trading platforms and stimulus payments from the government. The surge in investor inflows is also owed to the pandemic, during which low interest rates and bond purchases by the Federal Reserve pumped heavy money into the American financial system.\n\nThe year 2024 has already been a healthy year for the American stock market, driven by a strong performance by technology stocks. Tom Lee, the co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is bullish on the ongoing fiscal year and anticipates the market to triple in size by the end of the decade.\n\nThe two major factors driving Lee's bullish projection were the global labor shortage and a surge in the population of millennials. He mentions how millennials are the largest generation shaping the economy and are set to inherit big as we approach the generational wealth transfer of at least $80 trillion. According to a report, by 2030, millennials will have five times more wealth compared to what they have today. Moreover, the past two incidents of global labor shortage led to major spikes in technology stocks, and Lee is expecting the same again this time. However, he also warns of risks that could undermine his positive outlook, including AI backfiring, global recession, and geopolitical instability.\n\nThis uncertainty about the stock market, coupled with stocks' volatility, makes it difficult for investors to ascertain the true value of the stock they want to invest in. American billionaire hedge fund manager, Bill Ackman, in May this year, discussed the current state of value investors and acknowledged that predicting the durability of a stock is far harder than building a financial model in the world of investment. Responding to a question about the use of AI to analyze stock investments and financial markets, Ackman stated that AI platforms might help in decision-making over the short run, but there is no guarantee that they would continue working over the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nValue investors purchase stocks they believe have a high value but their share prices do not reflect the stock's actual worth, aiming to benefit when the market corrects itself. If the correct stocks are picked, it can lead to hefty returns for the investors through share price performance. One way of picking out the right stocks is noticing what the hedge funds are doing. Insider Monkey regularly covers top hedge fund stocks across industries for each quarter, and you can keep up with the information by following our website and subscribing to our newsletter. One such example is the 10 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe went through several threads on Reddit to identify the most talked about top undervalued stocks according to investors on the platform. After gathering a list of companies, we went through a stock screener to verify that these stocks were undervalued. Then we sorted and listed the stocks in ascending order of how frequently they were mentioned on Reddit for being undervalued. In cases where two or more stocks were level on the metric, we outranked one over the other based on hedge fund sentiment about the stocks in question. Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds for Q1 2024 was used for that purpose.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAn audience of moviegoers inside a theatre, savoring the latest cinematic experience.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC)\n\nInvestors on Reddit that consider the stock undervalued: 4\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) is one of the largest theatrical exhibition companies in the world, with 950 theatres and more than 10,000 screens as of March 2022. During the first quarter of 2024, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) beat analyst expectations by 19% for EPS, having posted -$0.62 per share during the quarter, which was also a major improvement from a loss per share of -$1.51 during Q1 2023. The company's revenue was also higher than forecasts by industry analysts, measured at $951.4 million.\n\nAccording to AMC, the quarter's revenue improvement was largely due to the significant growth in movie-going in March, compared to January and March. However, the company stated that while numbers for the second quarter are expected to be better than the first three months of the year, they are likely to be weaker compared to the previous year, as strikes in the industry delay the release of new movies. This is one of the reasons behind the bearish sentiment among some investors regarding the stock. Another cause of worry for them is that the company is $4.6 billion in debt, of which $2.8 billion is due for repayment soon. The company also faces fierce competition from on-demand streaming services. This is on top of the fact that AMC is heavily dependent on meme-stock rallies, which is not a good look in the long term.\n\nThe bullish opinion is otherwise. According to them, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) appears to be headed on the right track, with its loss per share drastically declining over the last few years, from -$195.80 per share in 2020 to just -$2.37 in 2023, and is forecast to be around -$1.26 per share this year. To improve margins, the company has closed 169 theatres across different regions since 2019, and at the same time opened 60 new theatres in better locations. The new theatres had an EBITDA of around $100 million more than the 169 that closed. As a result, its P/E ratio has improved 72% since 2021 to equal -3.06 last year. CEO Adam Aron is confident about the industry finally recovering from the impact of COVID-19 and expects the market to be 'roaring hot' in 2025 and 2026.\n\nIt is one of the best undervalued stocks to buy now according to Reddit, with a share price target of $5.95, an upside of 18.29%. Moreover, 17 hedge funds are bullish about the company, according to Insider Monkey.\n\nOverall AMC ranks 8th on our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to Reddit. You can visit 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Redditto see the other undervalued stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Red Flags: 3 Stocks Drowning in Debt to Sell ASAP",
        "content": "Almost every company has some debt. Many large and very profitable companies obtained significant\u00a0amounts of\u00a0debt when interest rates were negligible from 2009 until 2021. By doing so, they were able to make effective acquisitions that boosted their bottom lines and increased their cash holdings\u00a0in order to finance share buybacks, dividend increases, and make themselves more financially secure.\n\nOf course, these firms will have no trouble paying back their debt, and their interest costs are relatively negligible. In such cases, debt is positive for companies and their shareholders. Conversely, some troubled firms that usually lose money have run up\u00a0extremely large\u00a0amounts of debt\u00a0in order to\u00a0stay in business.\u00a0Often, these firms are paying high interest rates,\u00a0and\u00a0they\u00a0may have trouble paying back their loans.\n\nAnd if they are ultimately unable to make the payments on their loans, they will probably declare bankruptcy, causing their stock to become worthless. Consequently, investors should avoid buying the shares of such companies. These three firms are in the latter category, making them three stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC (AMC) Mobile phone with logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC). Pumping stock exchange prices by Reddit investors. Playing on market, manipulation. Losses, crisis.\n\nSource: Ira Lichi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMovie theater owner\u00a0AMC (NYSE:AMC) had nearly $9 billion in debt as of the end of the first quarter, along with only $624 million in cash. Moreover, its current ratio, which divides a company\u2019s current assets by its current liabilities, is 0.8. The fact that the firm\u2019s current ratio is meaningfully below one suggests\u00a0that it\u00a0may have difficulty making its debt payments over the next year.\n\nAnother factor that makes AMC one of the stocks to sell ASAP is\u00a0the fact\u00a0that its operations generally burn significant amounts of cash each quarter. For example, in Q1, its operations\u00a0burned $188.3 million of\u00a0cash, and in the previous quarter it lost $77.8 million\u00a0of cash\u00a0on its operations. As a result, it cannot fund the payments on its debt from profits from its business.\n\nOver $2.8 billion\u00a0of the company\u2019s debt will come due in 2026. Although AMC has held talks with its lenders about extending the due date on those loans, no deal on the matter has been reached yet, and the creditors may not have an incentive to extend the debt since AMC does not seem to be close to breaking into the black. As 2026 draws nearer, investors\u00a0are likely to\u00a0become more reluctant to buy AMC stock, causing the shares to tumble.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of the end of Q1,\u00a0Walgreens (NYSE:WBA) owed a\u00a0huge\u00a0$33.66 billion in debt and had only $711 million of cash.\u00a0What\u2019s more, its total debt-to-equity ratio was\u00a0a very large\u00a0218%, while its current ratio was 0.65. As I noted previously, the current ratio divides a company\u2019s current assets by its current liabilities, and firms with current ratios below one could have difficulty meeting their financial obligations in the next year.\n\nIn Q1, Walgreens\u00a0did manage to generate $604 million of cash from its operations. However, in the previous two quarters, its operations lost $637 million and $281 million of cash. Consequently, the retailer will probably\u00a0not be able\u00a0to pay off its debt with cash generated from its operations.\n\nAlso boding\u00a0badly\u00a0for Walgreens\u2019 outlook,\u00a0Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on June 28 slashed its price target on the shares to $11 from $22. The bank expects the company\u2019s profitability to\u00a0be hurt\u00a0by negative pharmacy reimbursement trends and weak sales of its general merchandise\u00a0going forward.\u00a0Bank of America cut its fiscal 2024 and\u00a0fiscal\u00a02025 earnings per share estimates for the retailer to $2.88 and $2.23, respectively, from $3.20\u00a0and\u00a0$3.30.\u00a0The bank kept an \u201cunderperform\u201d rating on the name.\n\nGiven Walgreens\u2019 huge debt and negative catalysts, it deserves to be on this list of three stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nBig Lots (BIG) Stock crash market exchange loss trading graph analysis investment indicator business graph charts of financial digital background down stock crisis red price in down trend chart fall. Why are stocks down today?\n\nSource: Bigc Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) is\u00a0by far\u00a0the most troubled company in this column. Indeed, the discount retailer issued a going concern warning in June. Specifically, the firm warned that it may\u00a0not be able\u00a0to make its loan payments and stay in business over the long term. As a result, it\u2019s\u00a0clearly\u00a0one of the top three stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nAs of the end of Q1, the firm\u00a0had a total cash position of just $44 million and total debt of $2.38 billion. Moreover, Big Lots\u2019 total debt-to-equity ratio was a stratospheric 2,917%. The company\u2019s current ratio was 1.39, indicating\u00a0that it\u00a0may have enough assets to pay its debts over the next year. Still, the company will\u00a0clearly\u00a0be in trouble over the longer term.\n\nIndeed, in the 12 months that ended in March, the firm\u2019s operations burned $230 million of cash, so it will not be able to make its loan payments with cash from its operations.\n\nIn Q1, the company\u2019s\u00a0revenue sank 10% versus the same period a year earlier while it generated a loss per share of $4.51.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "I\u2019ve seen my fair share of fads come and go. Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), the popular trading app favored by Gen Z and millennial investors, offers many stocks I\u2019d equate to fads. The platform has enabled a new generation to dive into the stock market. However, some of the most hyped-up stocks on Robinhood have underlying businesses that are destined to fail in the long-run. Their outdated business models simply can\u2019t keep up with the rapidly evolving tastes of younger consumers.\n\nHistory has shown that companies that fail to innovate and adapt to the next generation\u2019s needs eventually fizzle out. They may limp along for a while. But declining sales and market share will eventually catch up to them. And if these companies are already unprofitable, their demise is likely even more imminent.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019ll be discussing three Robinhood stocks that I believe are prime candidates to sell before Gen Z moves on. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The logo for AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC) is displayed above a movie theater entrance.\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) operates movie theaters, but faces major headwinds as consumer preferences shift to streaming. The company completed a $250 million share sale in May, diluting shareholders by around 25% and causing the stock price to plummet more than 14%.\n\nAMC has also repeatedly tapped equity markets to fund its operating losses and repay its substantial $8.6 billion debt load, as the value of its liabilities now exceeds its assets. Analysts expect AMC\u2019s revenue to drop 7% in 2024, and the company is not projected to turn a profit. Net income is negative, even if you exclude interest expenses. Robinhood Stocks: AMC financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI believe AMC\u2019s movie theater business model is dying in the face of the convenience offered by streaming platforms. Younger generations increasingly prefer streaming over going to theaters. Unless AMC can adapt, I don\u2019t see how the company can survive long-term, given its financial challenges and the secular decline of movie theaters.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s (NYSE:SPCE) future looks grim, as the company faces mounting financial challenges which have been partly driven by a flawed business model. The space tourism company has reported more than $100 million in losses each quarter, with its cash reserves dwindling to $867 million as of Q1 2024. I believe Virgin Galactic is on a path to further dilution and reverse stock splits in the coming quarters as it starts running out of money. It\u2019s hard to argue that cash won\u2019t run out by 2026.\n\nStory continues SPCE cash, revenue, EBIT chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company already implemented a 1-for-20 reverse split in June 2024 to regain compliance with NYSE listing requirements after its stock price fell below $1.\n\nAnalysts have raised concerns about Virgin Galactic\u2019s long-term viability, with some even suggesting bankruptcy risk is on the horizon. The company\u2019s space tourism tickets are extremely expensive, yet it still operates at a steep loss. In Q1 2024, Virgin Galactic reported a net loss of $102 million on a mere $2 million in revenue. I think the company is simply ahead of its time. Right now, there isn\u2019t enough demand or hype to make its business model profitable. As cash reserves dwindle, I expect SPCE stock will continue to dilute toward zero.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME) stock has soared lately, thanks to the resurgence of the meme stock phenomenon, but I believe investors should be cautious. The company\u2019s Q1 2024 results were disappointing, with net sales down significantly from $1.24 billion in Q1 2023 to $882 million. GameStop is also still unprofitable, with a net loss of $32.3 million for the quarter.\n\nThe only analyst currently covering the stock, Michael Pachter at Wedbush, has a sell rating and recently lowered his price target. I think Pachter is right to be skeptical. GameStop may have over $1 billion in cash thanks to issuing more shares, but without a clear turnaround plan, I worry the company will simply continue to burn through that money. And why hold GME stock in the first place if management just punishes big rallies by selling more shares?\n\nIn addition, the shift to digital gaming continues to be a huge headwind for GameStop\u2019s core business of selling physical games. Revenue has been in decline for years, and cost-cutting can only go so far. Unless GameStop can successfully pivot its business model, which I\u2019m doubtful about given the entrenched competition from the likes of Steam, the company looks to be on an unsustainable path. The meme stock hype may lead to short-term pops, but the company\u2019s underlying fundamentals paint a grim long-term picture for GameStop investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "When it comes to meme stock news as of late, Keith Gill has certainly been the driver of most investor attention to this space. Various meme stocks have surged on Roaring Kitty\u2019s involvement in simply noting his trades. Much of this sentiment makes sense when one harkens back to the price action of 2021 and the incredible meme mania we saw then.\n\nThat said, many top meme stocks have since lost their luster and momentum, falling once again on strong short-seller interest. The question is whether retail investors have enough juice to support the top meme stocks and propel them higher, particularly as many of the management teams behind these beaten-down businesses look for reasons to sell shares into any strength to raise capital.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the top three meme stocks that could be poised to crash and burn if this trend continues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock has mostly languished this year, punctuated by brief spikes such as a 135% surge over two days. Despite hopes among meme-stock enthusiasts for a revival akin to 2021, sustained positive momentum seems unlikely. While many may remain cautious about AMC, others may certainly be considering the potential catalysts that could transform its fortunes.\n\nMuch ado has been made around blockbuster movie slates, improving foot traffic, and rising ticket prices. But overall, these trends have been nowhere near enough to stop the bleeding from a loss perspective. The company has been forced to restructure its debt and extend maturities, moves that have offered glimmers of hope for certain investors. However, many others have viewed these moves skeptically, and rightfully so. AMC remains a heavily debt-burdened company with an operating model that appears to be fundamentally unsound.\n\nDespite a recent uptick, AMC\u2019s long-term outlook remains bleak. The company\u2019s reliance on increasing its share count to boost its balance sheet amid historically low foot traffic suggests unsustainable outcomes over the long term. Many see parallels with Blockbuster\u2019s fate, viewing AMC as surviving on borrowed time despite retail investor support.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a top video game retailer, GameStop (NYSE:GME) has been seeing growth deceleration pick up in recent years. Of course, the pandemic didn\u2019t help. And when the company was in its darkest days, it\u2019s true that Keith Gill and millions of other retail traders stepped in to save the day.\n\nThe thing is, investors have to question whether this is really a viable long-term investing strategy. The company\u2019s previous surges were clearly speculative in nature. And it\u2019s unclear whether the so-called \u201capes\u201d and \u201cdegenerates\u201d that supported GameStop the last time around will have enough dry powder to do so again.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile GME is still appealing to fans of gaming due to its consoles, merchandise, and video games, the numbers tell a different story. GameStop\u2019s revenue saw a 29.7% drop year-over-year, while the market only anticipated an 11.4% decline. This past quarter was particularly challenging, marked by revenue and EPS shortfalls without providing a future outlook. GameStop\u2019s stock plummeted 45.5% post-results, now trading around $27 per share.\n\nChewy (CHWY) Image of a Chewy (CHWY) branded delivery box in the middle of a well-lit living room.\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nChewy (NYSE:CHWY) saw a steep decline in its shares in recent days as investors reassessed signals from meme stock influencer \u201cRoaring Kitty.\u201d Initially, Chewy surged 34% last week after Keith Gill posted a cartoon dog on his X account, hinting at potential interest in the retailer. However, following news that Keith Gill had officially bought 6.6% of outstanding Chewy shares, amounting to roughly $250 million in the pet products retailer, shares of CHWY stock have been on a rather protracted downtrend.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see if this continues. Gill\u2019s bet on Chewy is certainly one that falls into the curious category for many investors. The company\u2019s troubled financial picture is one that many long-term value-focused investors wouldn\u2019t touch.\n\nBut for Gill, this is the kind of beaten-down stock with a turnaround story (and leadership from Ryan Cohen) that could have the potential to surge. We\u2019ll have to see. But for now, I think speculating on such a stock may be very foolish.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The glory days of the meme-stock phenomenon appear to be over. The heady days of 2021 when these names skyrocketed 30 or 40 times and stayed elevated for many months at a time appear to be long gone. On June 2, the leader of the meme-stock movement, Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, revealed that he had $211 million of GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock and options and then scheduled an appearance on YouTube to discuss the company\u2019s outlook. The shares subsequently spiked to around $46.50 from their previous level of about $26.50. But on June 7, they were back down to $27, and on July 11, they closed at $25.57.\n\nThe episode suggests that anyone who buys meme stocks now has to be ready to quickly sell them on any spike, while any speculator who purchases meme stocks while they\u2019re elevated can lose a great deal of money. Also importantly, it\u2019s possible that Roaring Kitty sold all of his GameStop shares and options during last month\u2019s spike and will return to the hibernation that he underwent between 2021 and May 2024.\n\nIf Roaring Kitty does avoid the spotlight again, meme stocks may not rebound sharply for years and could generally keep falling going forward. With that warning in mind, here are three meme stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChewy (CHWY) chewy ad in NYC\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this month, Roaring Kitty disclosed that he owned 9 million shares of pet e-commerce company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY). However, the shares actually fell sharply in the immediate wake of the investor\u2019s disclosure.\n\nThat dynamic suggests that Roaring Kitty cannot boost CHWY stock going forward.\n\nAlso negatively for CHWY stock, investment bank Argus on July 9 downgraded the name to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy.\u201d Among the reasons for the move are declines in the company\u2019s user base, the stock\u2019s high valuation, and Argus\u2019 belief that the retailer will have to invest a great deal to support its upcoming foray into Canada.\n\nAmerica\u2019s economic slowdown could also hurt Chewy\u2019s, Argus warned. All of these negative catalysts make me view CHWY stock as one of the meme stocks to sell at this point.\n\nWith CHWY stock changing hands at a very high enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of over 50 times, Argus is right to be concerned about the retailer\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso negatively for the company, 52% of consumers surveyed by investment bank Evercore ISI recently reported shopping at Chewy\u2019s, down from 64% in 2022.\n\nGameStop (GME) In this photo illustration the GameStop (GME) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn May and June, GameStop sold $3 billion of its GME stock. Not only will all of those new shares put a great deal of downward pressure on the share price, but the company\u2019s rush to sell so many of its shares amid the meme-stock revival indicates that it\u2019s not very confident in its own outlook. And speaking of a lack of confidence, I have not seen any evidence of GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, who\u2019s also a billionaire and the largest owner of GameStop stock, buying the company\u2019s shares this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, many speculators are probably holding GME stock in the belief that Roaring Kitty will make another appearance, sparking another brief rally in the name. But as I mentioned in the introduction to this column, it\u2019s entirely possible that Roaring Kitty sold all of his GME stock and the options that he held on GameStop. It\u2019s also possible that he will, emulating his modus operandi from 2021 to May 2024, stay out of public view for years to come.\n\nFinally, as I noted in a past column, GameStop\u2019s business model is broken.\n\nAMC (AMC) AMC movie theater front glowing in the setting sun with the name shining bright red. AMC stock.\n\nSource: Ian Dewar Photography / Shutterstock\n\nAMC\u2019s (NYSE:AMC) shares only rose about 20% during June\u2019s meme-stock rally, suggesting that the name is not going to benefit a great deal from any resurgence by the category going forward. And as I pointed out earlier in this column, such a resurgence may not occur, since Roaring Kitty may have sold his GME stock and options and could choose to remain silent for many years.\n\nOn the fundamental side, AMC on May 9 issued a negative announcement about its second-quarter results. Specifically, the movie theater owner stated that its Q2 financial performance may be meaningfully weaker than during the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe company blamed the weakness on strikes lowering the number of film releases last quarter. But continued, negative, structural issues plaguing the U.S. movie theater business are likely as much or more to blame for the company\u2019s poor performance as strikes.\n\nIndeed, in Q1, attendance at the company\u2019s U.S. theaters sank 5.8% versus the same period a year earlier to 30.5 million, while its revenue fell 0.3% year-over-year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "The 7 Most Undervalued Meme Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Meme stocks looked to be on the comeback trail in May of this year after retail trader Keith Gill, known online as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d made a triumphant return to social media after a three-year hiatus. By posting only a few cryptic memes heralding his return, Gill managed to more than double the share prices of popular undervalued meme stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).\n\nOther undervalued meme stocks, such as headphone maker Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) saw their stocks rise more than 20% on news of Gill\u2019s return. Meme stocks are defined as shares of a company that have gained viral popularity due to heightened social media attention. They tend to be stocks of once-dominant companies that have fallen on hard times and whose shares are heavily shorted on Wall Street.\n\nAs is typically the case, the meme stock rally of late May did not last long and most of the companies involved saw their share prices fall back to earth throughout June. The pullback has left many meme stocks deep in the red and looking cheap at current levels. Here are the seven most undervalued meme stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nWe\u2019ll start with GameStop. Setting aside the return of Roaring Kitty, the brick-and-mortar video game retailer continues to report abysmal financial results that are weighing on its share price. Results were particularly bad for this year\u2019s first quarter, which management issued along with plans to sell additional GME stock, further diluting the holdings of existing shareholders.\n\nThe end result is that GameStop stock has declined 50% from the peak it reached in mid-May this year when Roaring Kitty resurfaced. The company\u2019s shares are 70% below the all-time high they reached in January 2021 during the original meme stock craze. GameStop\u2019s sales in the first three months of this year totaled $881.8 million, down 29% from $1.237\r\nbillion a year ago. News of the stock dilution appears to have dampened enthusiasm over Roaring Kitty\u2019s return. That and a class-action lawsuit alleging a classic pump-and-dump.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop\u2019s earnings look sterling when compared to the finances of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). The company, which runs the Truth Social platform that is essentially a clone of Twitter, reported a net loss for this year\u2019s first quarter of $327.6 million on less than $1 million in revenue. Consequently, it\u2019s been a bumpy ride for DJT stock in recent months.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe share price has fallen 55% from a peak reached in March of this year shortly after the company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). DJT stock also fell 15% after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts related to falsifying business documents in a criminal hush money case. More recently, the stock has fallen 30% in the last month.\n\nWhile the share price decline is disappointing, it has certainly made DJT stock cheaper to buy for investors with an appetite for risk.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration, the Tilray Brands (TLRY) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCannabis producer Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) has also been getting cheaper as its finances deteriorate. The company most recently reported a quarterly loss of $105 million and lowered its forward guidance as its sales continue to decline. The result is that TLRY stock has fallen 20% this year. Over five years, the stock has declined 96% and now trades deep down on the penny stock league tables.\n\nTilray said that it expects earnings of only $60 million to $63 million for its entire 2024 financial year. The new guidance is down from earlier estimates of $68 million to $78 million in earnings. Management said they no longer expect positive free cash flow this financial year. The deteriorating situation has raised concerns about Tilray\u2019s ability to continue operating. Still, TLRY stock is not available to buy for less than $2 a share.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is also trading in the penny stock range having decreased 30% year to date. As with the other undervalued meme stocks, BlackBerry\u2019s share price is declining as the company reports woefully bad financial results. In this year\u2019s first quarter, BlackBerry\u2019s net loss grew by nearly 300% as its sales continued to deteriorate. The former smartphone maker reported a Q1 loss of $42 million, which was 282% greater than a net loss of $11 million a year earlier.\n\nRevenue at BlackBerry totaled $144 million in Q1, down 61% from $373 million a year ago.\r\nThe poor results come as BlackBerry prepares to divide its cybersecurity business and its\r\nInternet of Things (IoT) division. BlackBerry is also cutting costs as its financial situation worsens. Earlier this year, the company eliminated 200 jobs and closed six of its 36 global offices. It remains to be seen if the measures will be enough to right the ship.\n\nBB stock has declined 50% in the last 12 months.\n\nFisker (FSRNQ) Smartphone with logo of American electric vehicle company Fisker Inc. in front of business website. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. Fisker stock. FSRN stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a bankruptcy filing. Electric vehicle start-up Fisker (OTC:FSRNQ) has filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors and plans to sell its assets. The company\u2019s stock now trades for less than two cents on the over-the-counter market. But that hasn\u2019t stopped retail investors from bidding up this troubled meme stock. Fisker stock continues to pop occasionally as investors nibble at it, though the share price is down 99% on the year.\n\nFisker is the latest in a string of electric vehicle companies to seek bankruptcy protection from creditors, following Lordstown Motors. Analysts say the businesses are failing as the electric vehicle stock bubble bursts and consumers move away from battery-powered autos in favor of gas-electric hybrid models. Fisker made more than 10,000 vehicles in 2023 but delivered only about 4,700. This is the second time Fisker has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company now plans to sell its assets and restructure its debt.\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of cannabinoid company canopy growth cannabis, blurred marijuana in the background. CGC stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAnother cannabis stock. This one is Canopy Growth Corp. (NASDAQ:CGC). On the surface, things look to be improving for this company\u2019s stock. The share price has risen nearly 30% this year and is trading above $6. But don\u2019t be fooled. The gains and current share price are due to Canopy Growth executing a reverse stock split. Reverse stock splits are the opposite of regular stock splits. Rather than reduce the share price, they raise it by consolidating the stock.\n\nReverse stock splits are seen by markets as an act of desperation by companies that are trying to artificially boost their share price, often to avoid being delisted from an exchange. In the case of Canopy Growth, the company was in danger of being delisted by the Nasdaq exchange as its share price had been trading below $1. In response, the company consolidated its shares on a one-for-10 basis. Over the last five years, CGC stock has fallen 98% amid speculation that the company will file for bankruptcy.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Glendale, Arizona. AMC stock.\n\nSource: JJava Designs / Shutterstock\n\nWe\u2019ll end with another leading meme stock, AMC Entertainment. The largest U.S. movie theater chain saw its share price more than double when Roaring Kitty resurfaced. Unfortunately, the stock has since dropped 20% from a peak reached in mid-May and is on the cusp of falling into penny stock territory. In the last 12 months, AMC stock has decreased 85%, making the shares cheap if not undervalued.\n\nAMC Entertainment continues to struggle with a decline in moviegoers that began during the COVID-19 crisis and a big debt load that it took on during the pandemic when its theaters were closed or forced to operate at reduced capacity. At the start of this year, AMC had $8.6 billion of long-term debt, up from $5.2 billion before the pandemic. The company did manage to narrowly beat analysts\u2019 forecasts with its Q1 print. So there might still be hope for the company and its shareholders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The U.S. stock market has been on quite the run over the past 12 months, fueled by potential interest rate cuts and economic optimism. Moreover, the generative AI craze and meme stock trading frenzy have been two major needle-movers turbocharging the market. Hence, many in the Wall Street punditry believe the market\u2019s overheated, making it an excellent time to consider a few stocks to sell.\n\nMost stocks have surfed the speculative and AI trading wave, making them prime candidates for a fresh assessment. Moreover, considering that most investors expect a rate cut in September, this is another reason to offload stocks to sell and effectively optimize your portfolio. That said, here are three bloated stocks to sell, with their stock prices significantly divorced from their fundamentals. These stocks present limited upside potential and continue to be show-me stories despite the market\u2019s enthusiasm for them.\n\nStocks to Sell: Carvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA stock) logo on white object in foreground as well as a high-rise building in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline used car retailer Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) defied expectations following an amazing turnaround in the past year. Many anticipated a bankruptcy filing, but Carvana flipped the script completely. Following an adjustment of its debt obligations and an impressive recovery in its fundamentals, CVNA stock has soared more than 153% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts first-quarter (Q1) showing, in particular, proved massive for its business. It posted a remarkable Q1 profit of $49 million, an incredible pivot from a loss of $286 million in the previous year. However, it\u2019s imperative to highlight that this profit included a one-time $75 million boost from fair value adjustments on warrants to acquire AI-driven insurer Root (NASDAQ:ROOT).\n\nMoreover, despite the impressive financial turnaround, Carvana still faces major challenges with a lingering debt load of $5.5 billion. Therefore, investors must temper their enthusiasm, considering the stock\u2019s rapid jump in the past 12 months and its substantial financial obligations.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3IoT (AI) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI), known for its enterprise-scale AI software solutions, is another stock riding high on the AI bandwagon effect. AI stock is up 27% in the past three months, comfortably outpacing the sector median. However, this jump is more speculative than substantial, with the firm yet to turn a profit that justifies its current valuation. The market hasn\u2019t quite come to grips with the real demand for enterprise-level AI software, which complicates things for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its fourth-quarter (Q4) report, C3.ai reported a 16% year-over-year (YOY) increase in sales, reaching $310 million. Despite the superb top-line growth, its losses increased to $280 million from $268 million. Moreover, the firm now expects adjusted operating losses to range between $95 million and $125 million for the upcoming year, considerably higher than previous forecasts. Also, with the growing preference for AI companies with tangible growth, the outlook for C3.ai remains up in the air.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Mobile phone with logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC). Pumping stock exchange prices by Reddit investors. Playing on market, manipulation. Losses, crisis.\n\nSource: Ira Lichi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) continues to navigate the choppy waters of the meme stock frenzy, marked by massive volatility.\n\nOn the fundamental level, though, nothing has changed. The embattled theater chain operator remains overwhelmed by its crushing debt burden. Despite repaying $1 billion in debt since 2022, AMC still has a worrying $4.6 billion remaining, with $2.8 billion maturing in just two years.\n\nMoreover, the secular shift towards streaming services compounds AMC\u2019s financial struggles. The OTT video market is poised to expand staggeringly, outshining traditional movie-going experiences with its robust growth.\n\nAMC must also contend with a disappointing box office outlook for the year, weighing down its top-line results. Also, with the need to consistently raise capital through equity sales to manage interest payments and operational deficits, AMC is on a path toward destruction. Thus, it\u2019s wise to tune out the meme stock clamor and steer clear of AMC.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stop Laughing: 3 Meme Stocks That Are No Longer Funny",
        "content": "Meme stocks to sell continue sounding the alarm bells this year.\n\nHowever, this year\u2019s explosiveness in meme stocks is notably subdued compared to the original retail trading frenzy. Hence, the stock market seems to have evolved, and smart money is now approaching these stocks with greater caution and strategy.\n\nMoreover, according to Vanda Research, inflows into meme stocks are substantially lower compared to 2021, pointing to a steep decline in speculative interest. Also, most meme stock companies are struggling fundamentally and will continue burning investor value for the foreseeable future. Therefore, investors tempted by past gains should consider the risks involved with long-term financial erosion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKeeping that in mind, here are three lackluster meme stocks to sell. They offer little upside potential, and their dreary underlying businesses and dim prospects make it best to steer clear of them now.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) In this photo illustration the stock market information of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. displays on a smartphone while the logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. APE stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the height of the meme stock craze in 2021, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has seen a stark reversal of fortune.\n\nAMC stock trades for a mere $5 per share, representing a catastrophic drop of over 99%. This incredible downturn is linked to its aggressive strategy of issuing new stock, which has increased its share count from 23.6 million pre-pandemic to 295 million today.\n\nMoreover, from a financial standpoint, AMC continues to buckle under the weight of its debt load. The embattled theatre chain operator\u2019s long-term debt is north of $4.5 billion, excluding the $4.42 billion operating lease obligations through 2029. These obligations constrict the firm\u2019s ability to maneuver financially, weighing down efforts to rejuvenate its core cinema operations.\n\nIn addition, AMC has to contend with the broader decline in movie-going, propelled by the rise of streaming services. As foot traffic drops and revenue streams dry up, AMC faces an uphill battle to reclaim its former glory.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE:BB), the former smartphone titan, has stumbled in its transition to a cybersecurity and IoT specialist.\n\nDespite its best efforts, it hasn\u2019t been able to turn things around, as evidenced by its dwindling financial health. In its most recent quarter, BB reported a net loss of $42 million, more than a 280% increase from the $11 million loss recorded in the prior-year period.\n\nRevenues similarly paint a remarkably bleak picture, plummeting 61% to $144 million in the first quarter (Q1) from $373 million in the previous year. Amidst these ongoing troubles, the firm seeks to separate its cybersecurity unit from its IoT division while implementing belt-tightening measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt recently laid off 200 employees while shutting down six of its 36 global offices. Hence, the ongoing losses and a notable decline in its IoT business pose serious questions about the viability of its business model in a hotly competitive environment.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoftware giant MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has made major trades in cryptocurrency and paid maidens in the past year. MSTR stock gained upwards of 239% last year as it continues loading up on Bitcoin.\n\nIt recently purchased an additional 11,931 BTC for $786 million under the guidance of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. Following the massive purchase, the company\u2019s BTC holdings now stand at a staggering 226,331, valued upwards of $15 billion.\n\nHowever, the firm\u2019s heavy reliance on the notoriously volatile crypto market makes it prone to significant downside risk. Though the recent surge in BTC prices has bolstered its Bitcoin prices portfolio, the crypto market\u2019s inevitable fluctuations pose serious questions about its future. Moreover, we\u2019re already witnessing this vulnerability as MSTR stock plummeted more than 24% in the past month. Also, the trajectory of MSTR\u2019s stock is fraught with uncertain losses ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "Monday was an excellent start to the week for AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), with AMC stock during over 8% because of strong weekend box office sales.\n\nFans of Despicable Me lined up for its fourth sequel, driving $230 million in gross box office sales worldwide and $122 million in the U.S. This success saw both ticket and merchandise sales at AMC theaters surge over the previous year.\n\nIn the past weeks, AMC has been quite volatile. Currently, the company has a $1.6 billion market cap, and AMC stock is trading around $5.50 per share. The question many investors have is whether this recent uptick is sustainable, or if the company\u2019s longer-term downtrend will continue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s dive into some positives first, before assessing whether this stock\u2019s underlying fundamental issues are too big of a concern.\n\nHoliday Boost for Theater Stocks\n\nShares of AMC stock rose substantially after the company reported a significant holiday boost. Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) stock was upgraded by B. Riley analyst Eric Wold, who raised his price target to $27.\n\nWold cited potential market share gains and a 2025 box office rebound as reasons for this upgrade. AMC\u2019s strong July 4 traffic from Despicable Me 4 was the notable driver behind this stock\u2019s recent increase.\n\nDespite industry weaknesses, Wold anticipates further upside for Cinemark, with the company emphasizing premium experiences as the industry recovers.\n\nB. Riley reported that Q2 2024 domestic box office revenue missed expectations, totaling $1.95 billion, a 27% year-over-year drop and below the $2.35 billion forecast. This number also notably amounted to roughly 60% of Q2 2019 levels.\n\nRecent releases have underperformed, leading B. Riley to lower its 2024 box office projection to $8.2 billion from $8.5 billion. Despite optimism for a 2025 rebound due to a strong movie lineup, the analyst\u2019s 2025 estimate was also reduced to $9.7 billion from $9.9 billion.\n\nThe Bear Case\n\nAMC focused on improving its balance sheet, but has faced investor disapproval over plans for a debt reduction via equity swap. Bloomberg reported on June 24 about talks with lenders to reduce debt and extend bond maturities, causing a slight stock rise.\n\nAMC aims to swap some debt for equity, diluting shareholders. Optimists see potential cash flow improvement, but current foot traffic and revenue metrics suggest interest payments will still burden free cash flow.\n\nSignificant and widespread actions are needed for a substantial impact to be seen in the company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be cautious about AMC\u2019s outlook. By Q1 2024, AMC cut long-term debt to $8.99 billion, but $4.42 billion in lease payments through 2029 remains a burden. Despite recent positive debt reduction measures taken, lease payments strain cash flow, risking covenant violations.\n\nAMC Stock Still Looks Shaky\n\nAMC\u2019s growth metrics are mixed. The company\u2019s growth outlook remains uncertain, despite strong recent box office showings.\n\nInvestors will likely need to see sustained positive results on this front, with future quarterly losses also required to narrow in order for many to step into this stock.\n\nAMC is a company that\u2019s been moving in the right direction, driven in part by higher spending on experiences from consumers following the pandemic.\n\nThat said, there are long-term structural headwinds the company continues to battle, with high growth in streaming and home entertainment options taking away from the company\u2019s previous luster.\n\nI think AMC stock remains one investors may be best avoiding right now. The company\u2019s troubled balance sheet and its fundamental risk overshadows any sort of positive news in terms of box office headlines. For now, I think the safest thing to do is to move on to companies with far better growth prospects in this current market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The movie theater industry may be struggling right now, but Wall Street sentiment may be shifting positively for one company. Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) stock is in the green today after receiving an upgrade and increased price target.\n\nAnalyst Eric Wold of B. Riley Financial recently increased his CNK stock price target from $16 to $27 and upgraded his rating from a \u201cneutral\u201d to a \u201cbuy.\u201d Shares are rising today as the company garners momentum from this positive take. And Wold isn\u2019t the only expert who has expressed optimism regarding Cinemark\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening With CNK Stock\n\nTrading has been volatile for CNK stock so far today, with gains of less than 1%. However, shares have been trending upward all year, rising roughly 60% over the past six months. This is a substantially better performance than its chief rival, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which is barely in the green for the same period.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC has been benefitting primarily from its recently renewed meme stock status. But now there\u2019s reason to believe that Cinemark may be about to top it in that area as well. InvestorPlace contributor Stavros Tousios recently flagged it as a likely meme stock for the coming months but also highlighted its strong financials. As he reports:\n\n\u201cThe company recently reported a net income of $25 million and adjusted EBITDA of $71 million with a healthy\u00a012.2% margin. It ended the quarter with $789 million in cash and commitments to open 36 new screens over the next two years while peers outperformed. Management\u2019s solid execution during a challenging environment impacted by strikes could trigger a rush by short sellers to cover their positions.\u201d\n\nWold isn\u2019t the only Wall Street analyst who sees big things ahead for CNK stock. Mike Hickey of Benchmark kicked off July by reiterating a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for Cinemark and a bullish $23 price target. Out of seven surveyed analysts, six currently rate it as a buy, earning it a \u201cmoderate buy\u201d consensus. AMC, by contrast, has no buy ratings and currently holds a \u201cmoderate sell\u201d consensus.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nDespite operating in a struggling industry, Cinemark routinely proves that it is still a stable investment. AMC may receive more attention from r/WallStreetBets, but CNK stock is getting the right kind of praise, the kind that comes from financial sector experts.\n\nIf this bullish sentiment toward it continues to rise, Cinemark will be in an excellent position to continue growing throughout 2024 and beyond. Movie releases and meme stock momentum don\u2019t make a good investment. But as Cinemark has shown, strong financials do.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "From Pump to Dump: 3 Meme Stocks Headed for a Massive Crash",
        "content": "Meme stocks are some of the most dangerous investments to make right now. In my view, now may be a good time to sell many top meme stocks that have gone on big runs. Of course, investors can always put some \u201cfun money\u201d into these stocks as high-risk gambles. However, I would not recommend chasing the current meme stock rally. Most meme stocks have legacy underlying businesses that are bleeding cash and have negative growth. These companies are unlikely to provide long-term returns. In fact, they\u2019re more likely to dilute investors toward oblivion.\n\nThe recent roaring kitty-led hype cycle around many meme stocks has led to a sharp rally over the past few months. Some stocks have seen incredible gains, so I think it is the perfect time to trim positions, for those holding these names. Of course, the hype could continue. But I think most of the hype is likely dead, and will continue to die down in the coming months.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) operates a chain of video game and entertainment stores. The company\u2019s latest earnings release paints a grim picture for this meme stock darling. I\u2019ve been skeptical about the GameStop craze since its inception. Speculators, flush with stimulus checks back in 2021 (and the likes of Roaring Kitty and others prompting speculators to consider certain stocks) led to unsustainable valuations which proved to be too good to be true.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYes, GME stock is up an eye-popping 130% since the start of May, but it still hasn\u2019t managed to overtake its previous high due to excessive share dilution. While the retail trading frenzy has allowed GameStop to raise a boatload of cash, I believe now is the perfect time to take profits and run for the hills.\n\nGameStop\u2019s financials are simply too poor to justify its premium. The company is also closing many more stores than it is opening. Meme stocks to sell: GME stores opened/closed\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nNet sales plunged from $1.237 billion in Q1 2023 to a mere $882 million in Q1 2024. The company also remains deeply unprofitable, posting a net loss of $32.3 million on this revenue. Trading at an absurd 2.5-times forward sales, GameStop\u2019s valuation is completely detached from reality, given its lack of growth and widening losses. The cash raised from the meme stock rally may provide some temporary relief. But throwing money at a sinking ship is never a wise investment strategy. Further pumps will also likely be met with even more dilution. As such, I think it is one of the top meme stocks to sell right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The logo for AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC) is displayed above a movie theater entrance.\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is a massive movie theater chain operator, with a significant following. However, I believe this legacy business model is destined for decline. In its first quarter, AMC managed to broadly maintain revenues despite a drop in box office sales. However, I don\u2019t see this as a sustainable trend, given the relentless rise of streaming competitors.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated shifts in consumer behavior, with younger generations heavily favoring online entertainment options. Some studios are already experimenting with simultaneous streaming and theatrical releases. This could rapidly erode the viability of cinemas if it becomes the norm.\n\nAMC has improved its efficiency, though. Plus, higher per-patron revenues are commendable. That said, I view these tailwinds negatively, as I think they\u2019re just prolonging the inevitable. The company may survive in the near term as interest rates stabilize. But I believe AMC has very limited long-term growth potential in the face of digital disruption.\n\nAs streaming services become ever more dominant, physical movie-going will likely continue to dwindle. In my view, AMC is another meme stock that investors should consider selling before this small ongoing pump turns into a painful dump.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE:BB) provides cybersecurity solutions and Internet of Things (IoT) software. Indeed, while the days of BBM and \u201cCrackBerries\u201d are long gone, the company recently delivered a solid revenue beat this quarter, with both its IoT and cybersecurity divisions exceeding expectations. However, I believe this momentary uptick is unlikely to lead to a genuine turnaround for the struggling legacy tech player.\n\nWhile BlackBerry achieved its third straight quarter of improved cash flow and narrowed losses, the bar was set exceedingly low, given the company\u2019s multi-year decline. BlackBerry\u2019s $144 million in revenue still represents a staggering 61.4% plunge compared to the prior year. I\u2019m not convinced that eking out a modest revenue beat against the backdrop of such a dramatic collapse should be cheered.\n\nCEO John Giamatteo claims BlackBerry\u2019s strategy is working, but where\u2019s the proof? The company continues to bleed red ink with a 3 cent per share loss, and its vaunted IoT business saw a sequential drop in development seat revenue. Unless BlackBerry stems its chronic customer attrition and returns to profitability soon, this meme-propelled dead cat bounce will likely end in tears for retail bulls. In my view, BB stock is definitely one of the top meme stocks to sell right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Keeping track of your portfolio ups and down is hard. Being on top of all the news for each stock, and analyzing its stock price targets and other data, complicates it, particularly if you have a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nWhile you should take stock of your stocks at least once a quarter to make sure they remain on track with your investment thesis, you don\u2019t have as much time as you would like to follow them day-to-day.\n\nHowever, Wall Street analysts get paid to do that.

The forced closure of gyms and fitness centers during the lockdown period saw revenue crater 41% that year. Planet Fitness has worked out hard to surpass those peak pre-pandemic levels again.\n\nThe gym operator reported over $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2023. That\u2019s 55% more than it generated in 2019. Yet last year wasn\u2019t any easy time. Planet Fitness lost 7% of its value for the year and at one point had been down as much as 43%. It has climbed 63% from those lows, but TD Cowen analyst Max Rakhlenko thinks this is only just the beginning.\n\nThe analyst recently upgraded PLNT stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold\u201d and raised his stock price target on the assumption raising fees on the gym\u2019s Classic Card to $15 from $10 will give it a nice top-line jolt. He also sees improving gym economics over the next two years that will support building out more locations. A new CEO should infuse it with new life too.\n\nHowever, a 50% increase in the cost of membership might not be as conducive to retaining members even if it is only $5. And the cost of building new gyms will still be expensive in the current high interest rate environment. With Planet Fitness still mired in the culture wars, there may not be as much growth coming as forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\nCinemark (CNK) Cinemark movie theatre location in the Louis Joliet Mall in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nSource: LukeandKarla.Travel / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt doesn\u2019t grab as many headlines as rival AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) but movie theater operator Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) faces many of the same problems as its peers. Hollywood has lost its magic touch for producing blockbuster movies and people aren\u2019t going to the movies as much as they did before.\n\nSummers used to be filled with hits. Now theaters have to cross their fingers hoping something blows up. That is reflected in box office ticket sales that are down 23% year-to-date.\n\nYet Roth/MKM analyst Eric Handler sees better days ahead for Cinemark. He upgraded the cinema stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold\u201d and raised his stock price target to $26 per share from $19, a 37% increase. While there was no apparent analysis shared with the upgrade, Cinemark is spending its time fortifying its balance sheet, not building new theaters the market can\u2019t support. The theater operator says it hasn\u2019t abandoned new locations but it is a process that will play out over several years.\n\nCinemark reported stronger than expected first-quarter results, posting a 19-cent per share profit compared to a 21-cent per share loss that Wall Street anticipated. Last year the theater stock had a 3-cents per share loss.\n\nCNK stock is up 38% year-to-date and sits just above the Roth analyst\u2019s previous price target. It seems possible Cinemark will be able to reach that higher level. Whether it can hold onto it if the industry doesn\u2019t have a strong summer is doubtful.\n\nMaplebear (CART) Instacart logo on a phone screen over a yellow background with a timer, boxes, and a shopping cart. Instacart IPO.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock\n\nAfter a strong start to the year, Maplebear (NASDAQ:CART) has trended lower since its April high. Better known by its Instacart brand, the third-party delivery app rallied earlier this month after announcing a $500 million stock buyback program but again could not hold all the gains.\n\nUnlike Planet Fitness or Cinemark, Instacart thrived during the pandemic. Shopping for people and delivering their food was just what people needed during the lockdown phase of the global health crisis. The aftermath hasn\u2019t been so kind.\n\nPeople began resuming their previous shopping habits and demand for delivery has waned. Industry growth isn\u2019t robust, with only two percentage point increases expected over the next two years, according to Brick Meets Click and Mercatus. Maplebear is changing its focus too.\n\nGrowth for the delivery company won\u2019t come just from groceries but also ad revenue. It began inserting shoppable ads into YouTube videos for consumer products companies. That may be a viable revenue stream but it also represents a change in direction for the stock.\n\nYet it may be why Gordon Haskett analyst Robert Mollin upgraded Maplebear from \u201chold\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d and raised his stock price target to $45 per share from $37, a 22% increase. With the Instacart parent trading below $32 a stub, it represents a better than 40% increase.\n\nI\u2019m not sure Maplebear\u2019s outlook warrants the big boost. Investors should probably wait to see just how successful this vertical can be for the delivery company before buying in.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "What's Going On With Trump Media & Technology Stock On Monday?\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT), the operator of the Truth Social platform, is trading higher on Monday. Last week the company announced it expects to receive over $69.4 million from the cash exercise of warrants on June 20 and 21, 2024.\n\nThe cash exercise option became available after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the company\u2019s registration statement effective on June 18, 2024,\n\nTMTG revealed that if all warrants covered by the registration statement are exercised for cash, the company could receive up to approximately $247 million.\n\nAdditionally, the company will have $40 million of restricted cash become unrestricted due to the effectiveness of the registration statement. These funds add to the over $200 million in unrestricted cash already held by TMTG as of June 18, 2024.\n\nThe infusion of funds will likely support further development and expansion of its platforms, including Truth Social.\n\nTMTG has experienced a significant decline in market value. The conservative social media company\u2019s stock has dropped nearly 50% since May 30, following the conviction of former President Donald Trump on 34 felony counts in a hush money trial, CNN reports.\n\nDespite the falling share price, experts warn that TMTG remains overvalued. Truth Social is a minor player in social media compared to platforms like Elon Musk's X, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Instagram Threads.\n\nSome experts compare TMTG to meme stocks like GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc (NYSE:AMC), which trade on momentum rather than fundamentals.\n\nTrump, the dominant shareholder with 114.75 million shares, has seen his stake\u2019s value drop from $6 billion to about $3.1 billion since late May. The company plans to use the funds raised to enhance its ad platform and explore potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nTMTG stock gained 118% in the last 12 months.\n\nPrice Action: DJT shares are trading higher by 7.12% to $29.63 premarket at last check on Monday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Trump Media & Technology Stock On Monday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The Return of Meme Stock Madness: Should You Steer Clear of GME, AMC and RDDT?",
        "content": "Meme stock madness has returned to Wall Street after a three-year hiatus, with Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. Keith Gill) drawing in massive crowds online with his big bets on GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock.\n\nThough Roaring Kitty has since (reportedly) dumped his GME options, he\u2019s still long on the stock big-time, with a huge stake worth anywhere from $220,000 to $262,000. Given how profoundly volatile GME stock has been, the value of his stake is sure to change by double-digit percentage amounts on any given day.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to tell what Roaring Kitty\u2019s intentions are this time around, I still think investors should resist the urge to follow him. And I most definitely would not want to bet against him, as GME stock could easily spike overnight on no news.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the 2024 edition of the meme madness, GME stock has skyrocketed twice already, and it may or may not be the last time it will do so. So, whether or not Mr. Gill\u2019s hands are made of diamonds, investors should be very cautious when approaching such a choppy name if they\u2019re seeking to invest rather than spin the roulette wheel.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop stock is coming off a sharp plunge after its latest spike above $45 per share, now down around 47% off that second spike. Undoubtedly, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that many speculators are looking for that third spike to hit in the coming weeks or months. Could the third time be the charm? I have no idea, nor does the Roaring Kitty himself.\n\nWith the stock pulling back on the day Gill went live on stream, GME stock continues to be a mysterious mover. Many bulls will likely get hurt as the volatility remains off the charts going into the summer. Additionally, many shorts are at serious risk of losing more than just their shirts. It will be interesting to see how the meme frenzy plays out for the rest of the year.\n\nEither way, I\u2019d not look to get in on the mania, even if CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s cost-cut plans can help the firm turn a corner. At the end of the day, the stock will move based on euphoria rather than the fundamentals.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is the iconic movie theatre chain that\u2019s getting caught up in the meme stock boom once again. Compared to GME, AMC stock has been relatively tame, with the stock pulling back just shy of 30% from that May 2024 peak.\n\nAs the company continues chipping away at its debt load while taking steps to return to the growth track in the face of streaming headwinds, AMC stock definitely seems like a more tempting meme stock to back versus the likes of GameStop. Even if you\u2019re a fan of the business and its turnaround trajectory, punching your ticket here could prove nothing more than a gamble, especially if meme traders continue taking their profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell when the meme madness will fully wind down and the May spike will dissipate. Either way, investors should exhibit caution, especially as AMC succumbs to meme stock madness that could easily go either way.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit Layoffs. Phone showing Reddit logo on screen in front of blurred background with reddit logo. Reddit IPO. AI Stocks\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock\n\nReddit (NASDAQ:RDDT) is the social platform that\u2019s been really buzzing of late as meme stock investors gather to reveal their plans for stocks like GME and AMC shortly. Whether we\u2019re talking about the r/WallStreetBets or the company\u2019s recent licensing deals with various artificial intelligence (AI) firms, like OpenAI, I view RDDT stock as perhaps the most investable stock on this list.\n\nThough tricky to value, the company has notable tailwinds that could help extend its run. As more investors begin viewing Reddit as a data resource for AI companies, I view the potential for additional multiple expansions. Additionally, Reddit may benefit from infusing AI across various parts of its platform.\n\nIn any case, RDDT stock stands out more as a data-centric way to play the AI boom. Any meme stock-driven upside from here is nothing more than a bonus for investors with the discipline to lighten up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As the stock market grows, savvy market watchers must know that all that glitters is not gold. In the landscape of soaring indices, certain stocks represent ticking time bombs, laden with issues that could lead to significant declines when the market cools off.\n\nThe market\u2019s current exuberance masks underlying vulnerabilities in several sectors, where companies face critical challenges ranging from operational inefficiencies to overstretched valuations. General market trends or temporary catalysts may have buoyed these stocks. Still, as the broader financial climate shifts, they are poised to falter, carrying a significant risk of loss.\n\nInvestors should be particularly wary of stocks showing signs of bloated valuations with no fundamental earnings support and companies struggling under excessive debt. Steering clear of these high-risk investments can be prudent as the market approaches a potential downturn. Here are three stocks that appear too toxic to touch, poised for a downturn when the market inevitably shifts from its current highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNIO (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNIO (NYSE:NIO) has been navigating a tumultuous period marked by declining revenues, intensified competition and significant financial losses. Despite efforts to expand its product line and enter new markets, the company\u2019s performance continues to lag behind industry leaders, raising concerns about its prospects.\n\nNIO\u2019s path to profitability remains uncertain amidst its current financial challenges. The company\u2019s continuous operational losses and declining cash reserves highlight the need for strategic capital raises, which could lead to further shareholder dilution.\n\nNIO\u2019s first quarter results in 2024 revealed an 8.7% year-over-year (YoY) decline in total revenues, falling short of market expectations by $75 million. Vehicle sales suffered due to a decrease in average selling prices, attributed to adjustments in user rights since June 2023. The company\u2019s operational losses widened, with NIO posting a net loss of $728 million, approximately 9% worse than the previous year.\n\nThe company\u2019s guidance for Q2 2024 showed mixed signals. NIO projected revenues between $2.297 billion and $2.373 billion, well ahead of the average street estimate of $1.99 billion. However, vehicle delivery guidance of 54,000 to 56,000 units was somewhat disappointing given that April and May combined already accounted for over 36,150 deliveries.\n\nGameStop (GME) Medium shot of a video game developer team brainstorming. Video game stocks\n\nSource: Frame Stock Footage / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) has recently captured the market\u2019s attention again following a dramatic uptick in stock price driven by speculation and investor frenzy. Despite this surge, GameStop\u2019s underlying financial health and business model are exposed to significant risks.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, GameStop reported a 29% revenue decline to $881.8 million, primarily due to intense competition from e-commerce and online gaming platforms. The company\u2019s operating loss for the quarter was reported at $32.3 million, reflecting ongoing struggles to adapt to the rapidly evolving retail landscape.\n\nGameStop\u2019s challenges are compounded by the shift towards digital gaming, which has significantly reduced the demand for physical game sales, traditionally GameStop\u2019s forte. Competitors with robust online platforms continue to erode GameStop\u2019s market share, making it difficult for the company to regain footing.\n\nGameStop\u2019s valuation has surged in the short term, but this increase appears disconnected from its financial realities. The company is trading at multiples significantly above historical averages without corresponding improvements in financial performance.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has recently been on a roller coaster ride. The company\u2019s survival hinges on continued aggressive financial restructuring and capital market activities. Despite some positive moves to reduce debt, the overall outlook remains grim due to persistent operating losses and heavy competition from streaming services.\n\nAMC\u2019s Q1 2024 results highlight the company\u2019s ongoing struggles. Revenue was essentially flat compared to Q1 2023, with $951.4 million reported. However, the net loss was substantial at $163.5 million, a slight improvement from the previous year\u2019s $235.5 million.\n\nSo far in 2024, box office results have been dismal. The drop can largely be attributed to the SAG-AFTRA strike pushing many movie releases to later in the year. While the domestic box office is expected to pick up with a stronger slate of movies like \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d projections still put the domestic box office at around $8.2 billion for the entire year, down -10% from 2023.\n\nHence, avoiding AMC stock is financially prudent, given the current financial pressures and competitive dynamics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Judgement Day for Roaring Kitty? 3 Meme Stocks to Sell ASAP.",
        "content": "Meme stocks are essentially shares of a company that have gained immense popularity through social media. Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d on social media, helped start this craze, which became amplified through the subreddit r/WallStreetBets.\n\nThis led to the price of meme stocks exploding before subsequently dying down. This has happened again quite recently, with Gill\u2019s return to social media. Meme stocks that were thought to be dead or dying suddenly showed signs of life.\n\nNow, Gill is the fourth-largest holder of GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares, based on an account update from the beloved social media user that shows a position of 9 million shares. This came after he closed out of his position in about 120,000 call options.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause meme stocks tend to trade more on internet chatter and not business fundamentals, they aren\u2019t investments for a buy-and-hold portfolio. If you do own any meme stocks, you might want to sell them asap before the meme stock trade crashes. When it does, you don\u2019t want to get stuck going down with Roaring Kitty\u2019s ship.\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop is a retailer that focuses on the videogame and gaming niche. It operates through both a physical and online marketplace. While it is quite U.S.-centric, GME also operates in Canada, Australia and Europe.\u00a0Roaring Kitty is now the fourth-largest investor in GME stock.\n\nAfter a bombshell disclosure by Keith Gill, who showed that he had tens of millions of dollars invested in GME, the stock went up by over 70% at one point.\n\nHowever, this also made GME grossly overvalued \u2014 by an average of 66.07% as per analysts. The company has missed the last two earnings estimates and has seen negative quarterly revenue growth of 28.70%.\n\nAdditionally, there are no strong growth catalysts for GME at the moment. Recently, CEO Ryan Cohen said the company would focus on cutting costs in the upcoming days. While this is a welcome change, when combined with declining sales and other factors, this puts GME in a precarious situation. Thus, I believe that it is time to offload this meme stock.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is one of the largest theatre chains in the U.S. and the world. Just like GME, although it is primarily U.S.-based, AMC also has operations in Europe. It is currently trading at a valuation of $4.86, with AMC stock being down 88% over the last year, showcasing its inherent volatility.\n\nDespite annual revenue increasing, AMC continues to lose money. Additionally, over the last three quarters, the chain has begun to see its revenue decline. AMC is still producing losses as well, though last quarter they did narrow considerably. In addition to this, the company is heavily in debt with $8.99 billion in corporate borrowings, operating leases and exhibitor services agreements It has only $624.2 million in cash and equivalents. A negative free cash flow of -$281.74 million isn\u2019t helping AMC either.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere appears to be a lack of growth prospects as well. Since the pandemic, people have become increasingly attracted to on-demand streaming services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Prime Video, Hulu, etc. This has directly had a negative impact on AMC and there\u2019s no data to suggest the trend is reversing. It makes AMC a meme stock you should sell instantly.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is an America-based electric vehicle (EV) company. While it is quite ambitious, the fundamentals of LCID do not work in its favor. This has made this once-promising company a meme stock that you should sell.\n\nLCID saw an earnings decrease during its last fiscal year. In fact, Lucid lost 54.06% more than FY2022. While it has seen decent revenue growth, it loses money on every car it makes. Lucid\u2019s operating margin of -422.55% nullifies the sales it makes. Additionally, the company is carrying EBITDA of -$2.8 billion, which offers excellent insight into the tumultuous nature of the company\u2019s internal operations.\n\nThe catalysts for this company offer only grim news. Just last month, analyst forecasts became more bearish for LCID, which carries a negative wave with it. Investors will likely get spooked by this, driving its share price down further. Additionally, LCID recently laid off 6% of its workforce, which certainly isn\u2019t a positive indication, making this a stock you should sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve is yet to cut interest rates and make capital cheaper. FUD fund futures project the central bank will cut rates two times this year, with the first one in September, which could influence decisions on meme stocks to sell.\n\nBut even if that happens, the market would get a signal that the economy needs to be stimulated even though inflation is off the 2% target. Historically, such an indicator would make the market more volatile in the short run. And which asset is inherently volatile already? Meme stocks.\n\nIn fact, investors may be looking at macro data and pushing in the profit-taking direction. This alone would put a sell pressure on these assets as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at meme stocks to sell, ones that have had plenty of gains already to lock in profits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe meme twin of GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) benefited from mid-May\u2019s return of Keith Gill aka Roaring Kitty, the stock meme maker. At that time, AMC announced the sale of shares worth $164 million. Accounting for accrued interest and principal, that would place the stock price at $7.33 per share.\n\nThis was just after the filing of 72.5 million sold shares, raising $250 million, at an average price of $3.45 per share. While this goes a long way in diminishing AMC\u2019s debt, it is still exceedingly high at $10.56 billion as of the latest May filing.\n\nConcurrently, AMC\u2019s accumulated deficit actually grew from the year-ago quarter, from $7.9 billion to $8.15 billion. At the same time, the company is yet to churn out a substantial profitable quarter (net income above $114M) since 2013.\n\nThe question investors need to ask then, are AMC fundamentals ever going to bridge this gap? Simply put, meme fumes alone are unlikely to cut it. Aligning with lower arts attendance, 6% less in 2022 than in 2017, movie theater attendance is even worse, showing little to no signs of recovery.\n\nAlongside poorer movie quality, ideological commitments from movie studios that cause friction with audiences, and less security in urban areas, investors also have to account for new habits. Social media is habituating users to short-form content, and people are socializing less for coordinated excursions to movies.\n\nCompounded with consumer weakening via inflation, none of it points to AMC\u2019s recovery. At the present price of $4.86, AMC stock is double its 52-week low of $2.38 per share, making for a solid exit point. Investors who are betting on memory have a 52-week high of $54.97 to look for, as an unlikely and brief scenario.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nFocusing on digital lending, investing, and personal finance, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) has become popular with retail. This garnered their attention outside the user experience into the SOFI stock itself, similar to Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD).\n\nIn turn, SOFI stock has seen much volatility during 2024, settling at 33% decline year-to-date (YTD). Unlike AMC, however, SOFI doesn\u2019t have weak fundamentals. The platform gained 20% more accounts year-over-year (YOY) to current $151 million.\n\nSoFi Technologies increased net income in Q1 of 2024 substantially, $88 million from net loss of $34.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, if the Fed\u2019s hard landing happens, these figures will go down. At present price of $6.42, SOFI stock almost matches its 52-week low price, which is not far from the 52-week average of $8.01 per share.\n\nThe bottom line is, SoFi Technologies is not a weak stock, but its volatility injected a lot of noise, ahead of macro headwinds. This marks SOFI stock as one of meme stocks to sell, but to keep it in mind later on.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeter Thiel\u2019s Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is a great case of locking in profits. Known as deeply embedded in deep state operations owing to its data integration and analytics platforms, the company lacks weak fundamentals.\n\nIn the last Q1 of 2024 earnings, PLTR (named after far-seeing crystal balls in The Lord of the Rings) achieved 21% YOY revenue growth. Ahead of the government revenue increase of 16%, commercial revenue grew by 27% YOY, with 42% client base growth.\n\nMore importantly, the company continued its six-successive quarters profitability streak. However, with market volatility on the horizon, and the company\u2019s five years of net losses, this is a strong case to designate PLTR as one of meme stocks to sell.\n\nPresently priced at $25.82, PLTR stock is above its average 52-week level of $19.01, and nearly doubles its 52-week low of $13.56 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is among the top global theater chains many investors have ignored for its underlying business model.\n\nIndeed, most retail investors in this name are investing not for the company\u2019s fundamental growth prospects or its outlook moving forward. Those are rather negative.\n\nIt\u2019s the company\u2019s upside potential as a meme stock, and its corresponding short-squeeze potential, that drives most of the discussion around this name.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile AMC has certainly seen many near-term surges over the past few years, there\u2019s a reason why the trend has remained negative.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think cautious is advised for investors seeking a high-upside growth opportunity in this current environment.\n\nWhat Jim Cramer Has to Say\n\nAmong the talking heads many investors don\u2019t pay much attention to, Jim Cramer has been outspoken about many names during the previous incredible meme stock rallies we\u2019ve seen.\n\nOn the meme stock front, he\u2019s been largely right, suggesting investors ignore names such as AMC right now.\n\nInteresting, Jim Cramer recently noted a paradox among bullish investors. Such investors seek a slowing economy with rate cuts and strong demand to shield their firms from risks like the yield curve.\n\nDespite economic weakness, some companies have thrived. Cramer highlighted the manufacturing slowdown, with the ISM index falling to 48.7 in May from 49.2 in April, marking the 18th contraction in 19 months; he found May\u2019s new orders decline particularly concerning.\n\nCramer advised buying oil and gas stocks, expecting a rebound in the economy. He also noted strong retail performances from major retailers and cyclical names, which he found unexpected.\n\nAs a bear on AMC and the meme stock movement, his recommendation is to sell, as there\u2019s simply not enough in the way of fundamentals to support this recent rally. Here, I have to agree with Cramer on this one.\n\nAMC is Similar to GameStop\n\nAMC Entertainment, following GameStop (NYSE:GME) as a top meme stock, lacks GameStop\u2019s recent improvement in per-share losses. To many investors, this shows a less-promising recovery path.\n\nTo raise funds, AMC has engaged in multiple dilutive share offerings amid low moviegoer turnout. The company is diversifying into puzzling endeavors such as AMC-branded candy, citing extensive R&D with confectioners, despite ongoing financial challenges.\n\nI\u2019m not sure these investments will pay off, and it\u2019s unclear what the ROI will be on these moves.\n\nI think this strategy raises questions about prioritization, especially as AMC continues to report significant net losses without year-over-year improvement.\n\nStory continues\n\nUntil the company focuses on creating a business model that can be cash flow positive and show accretive earnings growth, this is a name to steer clear of.\n\nSell AMC Stock Before It\u2019s Too Late\n\nIt\u2019s my long-standing view that the movie theater model has officially been broken.\n\nConsumers just aren\u2019t watching movies as they previously have \u2014 we\u2019ve entered a new era of entertainment, one that\u2019s driven by streaming and at-home offerings which are better than visiting the cinema.\n\nYes, AMC has seen some recent strength in its blockbuster movies and foot traffic metrics. But despite record recent volumes, there\u2019s simply not enough here for investors to jump aboard and buy into this flailing business model.\n\nOver the long-term, I expect AMC stock to trend toward zero. Short squeeze enthusiasts and meme stock traders have only delayed the inevitable.\n\nI think investors who want to position their portfolios for success may want to steer clear of this stock altogether right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Moreover, many investing pundits believe the stock market is currently littered with overhyped stocks. Hence, rotating out of overhyped stocks to sell could ensure portfolio stability ahead of a sustained bull run.\n\nThese three stocks to sell offer limited upside, marked by significant losses and stunted top-line growth. Each of these companies faces skepticism over their future prospects. Moreover, these stocks face a consistent pattern of negative returns.

However, while the saying goes, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going,\u201d this adage doesn\u2019t quite hold up for Lucid.\n\nDespite posting a 40% jump in EV deliveries on a year-over-year (YOY) basis in the first quarter (Q1), the firm delivered only 1,967 vehicles. Moreover, it posted a sizeable net loss of $680.8 million, positioning the firm on a daunting path of financial losses.\n\nOnce again, the Saudi Private Investment Fund swooped in to rescue the company, injecting a fresh $1 billion. This move highlights the substantial funding needed to keep the company afloat.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s $172 million for the quarter fell short of expectations by $10 million. This shortfall in sales and heavy capital expenditures needed to scale production paints a grim picture of Lucid\u2019s financial health.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is one of the most popular meme stocks that continues struggling to show signs of a durable recovery. It has capitalized on its bloated meme stock valuations to attract investor capital through successive dilutive share offerings. Despite the efforts and ventures into new income streams such as the AMC-branded candy, the cinema giant reported a staggering $100 million net loss in its most recent quarter.\n\nMoreover, AMC\u2019s challenges are further exacerbated by a 5.8% YOY drop in U.S. attendance in Q1 and a massive $268 million cash burn over the past year. With the secular shift towards streaming services, that trend will likely continue. The shift to streaming effectively reshapes the entertainment landscape, suggesting that the company\u2019s current strategies must be revised. Consequently, we\u2019ve seen the stock tank 88% last year and more than 98% in the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme.

BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is another popular meme stock,\u00a0 offering little stability or potential growth catalysts ahead. It recently posted a worrying 18% slump in sales with $54 million in net losses. For the past eight consecutive quarters, BYND has posted negative sales growth and a negative EPS. Despite riding the wave of the plant-based eating trend at its peak from 2016 to 2019, it has consistently posted net losses since 2016.\n\nThe CEO of Beyond Meat admitted the drop in demand for several products, including the soon-to-be-discontinued Beyond Meat Jerky. The overall softness in demand points to deeper issues with the firm\u2019s product lineup and lackluster market strategy. Though the retail trading frenzy momentarily reignited interest in the stock, banking on a potential short squeeze is speculative at best. Hence, it\u2019s best to avoid investing in BYND stock, as it continues to burn shareholder value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "In the always-changing stock market environment, selecting the right stocks to sell is as important as selecting the right ones to acquire. The investigation is centered on identifying underperforming companies and comprehending the signals that indicate when to sell. Understanding when to sell can improve portfolio performance overall and shield assets from large losses. Given the market\u2019s volatility as June approaches, carefully examining assets is extremely important.\n\nMeanwhile, one can avoid unanticipated downturns by regularly monitoring important financial measures, growth patterns, and market circumstances. This strategy aids in risk mitigation and resource reallocation to more attractive possibilities. With the important intelligence provided here, investors will be better equipped to manage the market\u2019s complexity and take action ahead of any dips.

Its top-line growth has considerably accelerated. The top-line growth was just 3.2% year-over-year (YoY), with $1.14 billion in total sales for Q1 fiscal 2025. This\u00a0reflects a sharp flip against the exponential growth observed at the pandemic\u2019s height. Despite a 5.3% YoY boost in enterprise revenue, the 3.2% total top-line growth indicates a solid decrease in other segments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, the boost in revenue was not uniform throughout the regions. While EMEA experienced a 2% YoY gain, APAC witnessed a 2% fall. The Americas saw\u00a0YoY growth of 4%. This\u00a0highlights the adversities prevailing in sustaining balanced growth in international markets. The adversities have emerged from aggressive competition and market saturation. In Q1 fiscal 2025, the average monthly churn rate increased from 3.1% in Q1 2024 to 3.2%, even though a 0.1% Churn Rate boost indicates a problem with client retention, especially given that top-line growth is already decreasing.\n\nIn summary, slowing top-line growth, high churn rates, and customer transition make Zoom an ideal mark on the stocks to sell list.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. on screen in front of website.

These systems are used to power electric vehicles and provide stationary power solutions. Plug Power delivered a considerable EPS loss of $0.46 for Q1 2024. Here, the company has issues with its bottom line. The timing of electrolyzer deployments and seasonality\u00a0greatly impact Plug Power\u2019s top-line numbers. For instance, H1 2024 may account for one-third of the company\u2019s total revenue for the year. Performance might become uneven if revenue creation is dependent on time and seasonality.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the Department of Energy (DOE) is providing a pending loan guarantee, and the corporation is awaiting conditional commitment approval. It demonstrated its reliance on government backing by securing prizes for multiple projects totaling\u00a0up to $163 million. Changes in government policy or delays may affect when and how much financial help is supplied. Hence, this reliance may make the business less financially independent and more vulnerable to outside political and economic threats, which might impede its expansion goals.\n\nOverall, Plug Power\u2019s dependency on external financing and grants, seasonality and sales timing, and negative bottom line contribute to its listing among the top stocks to sell.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), the largest movie theater chain, reported a stable top-line of $951.4 million in Q1 2024, in line with Q1 2023. However, the company\u2019s bottom line remains in the red, with a net loss of\u2014$163.5 million in Q1 2024. The decline in the adjusted EBITDA, from positive $7.1 million in Q1 2023 to negative $31.6 million in Q1 2024, indicates that operational profit generation is still a challenge for the company.\n\nMoreover, with overall revenue per patron (RPP)\u00a0falling by 2.9%, admissions RPP falling by 2%, and food and beverage RPP falling by 1.4%, the foreign segment\u2019s results were less clear. Local content offerings and the country mix had an impact on these decreases. Overall, per-patron indicators were negatively impacted, for example, by a significant attendance increase in Italy, a region with\u00a0historically lower revenue per patron, combined with declining attendance in higher revenue-per-patron areas such as Sweden and Germany.\n\nIn short, top- and bottom-line declines with international performance variability place AMC Entertainment\u2019s stock on the stocks to sell list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

AMC and other meme plays have only partially come along for the ride.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s a good chance that, given the aforementioned scrutiny, and how poorly the latest \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d social media event went, further stunts may have little impact on GME, much less other meme stocks.\n\nHence, it\u2019s better to assume that, not too long in the future, AMC makes another big move, but in the other direction.\n\nThat is, a renewed focus on the company\u2019s poor fundamentals will drive a severe re-pricing. Put simply, if you currently hold a position, this should be having you on the edge of your seat.\n\nA Late Summer Reversal\n\nAMC has raised billions selling newly issued shares, but with this substantial share issuance has come severe shareholder dilution.\n\nIf that\u2019s not bad enough, while the company has used a good portion of these capital flows to pare down debt, it\u2019s had to use quite a bit of it to absorb continued operating losses as well.\n\nThat\u2019s because the company has still yet to fully recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on movie theater attendance.\n\nBox office figures so far this year have trailed that reported in 2023. This trend is expected to continue through the busy summer movie season. Best case scenario, the 2023 U.S. summer box office could be down 27% compared to summer 2023.\n\nAdmittedly, this is largely due to the impact of last year\u2019s Hollywood union strikes, which affected and delayed film production.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat may not matter much to investors, when AMC next reports fiscal results. This is expected to occur sometime in early August.\n\nPoor quarterly earnings and a dilutive equity raise could reverse shares in late summer.\n\nBottom Line: Duck Out Now\n\nLike we\u2019ve noted before, all signs point to further downward spiral for AMC shares.\n\nTo get its financial house back in order, AMC needs to sell or issue billions worth of additional new shares. At least, based on the company\u2019s $4.5 billion in total long-term debt.\n\nEven if such heavy dilution ends up happening, it may still not be enough to stem further losses. Irrespective of whether there is additional shareholder dilution, a further slump for the movie business stands to weigh down further on the stock.\n\nNeed even more convincing? Unless results improve dramatically, the AMC stock meme saga is going to eventually reach the final chapter: Chapter 11. If you\u2019re still sitting in the theatre, there\u2019s no need to sit through the credits. Consider it time to duck out.\n\nAMC stock earns a D rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Faraday Future (FFIE) Stock: To the Moon or Straight to Zero?",
        "content": "You could almost feel retail investors celebrating in late May after shares of electric vehicle maker Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (NASDAQ:FFIE) surged from 4 cents to $1.80. The stock briefly became the most researched stock on InvestorPlace.com, and social media sites made it sound as if the only direction FFIE could go was up.\n\nOf course, this simplifies the situation.\n\nCalling Faraday Future an \u201cEV maker\u201d is relatively generous, considering the firm built roughly 15 vehicles last year and sold just four. (It also leased six and has several more as finished goods on its balance sheet). \u201cEarly-stage EV startup\u201d is a more fitting term. As for research, most of our InvestorPlace.com writers have consistently warned readers to stay away from the firm for its \u201chigh risk and little reward profile.\u201d InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto goes even further, suggesting investors buy puts on the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese warnings have largely gone ignored, given the numerous call options remaining on the stock. The company also continues to be worth over $200 million on public markets.\n\nThat\u2019s because there is a grain of truth that Faraday Future might keep going up. Stocks are worth precisely what buyers are willing to pay, and history tells us that meme stocks can often see a \u201cdouble peak\u201d as latecomers jump in.\n\nThe Double Peak\n\nPerhaps the best example of resurging meme stocks is GameStop (NYSE:GME). In March 2021, shares of the videogame retailer spiked a second time after a new wave of speculators joined in. Unlike early investors, these latecomers cared little about the company\u2019s valuation or its underlying business. According to Google Trends, search volumes for \u201cGME\u201d overtook those of \u201cGameStop\u201d by almost a 2-to-1 ratio that month.\n\nIn other words, if people were making money on the ticker, why bother knowing anything more about the company?\n\nThe results are as you might expect. Shares of GameStop rebounded from a split-adjusted $10 that February to over $66 the following month.\n\nA similar story happened with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Here\u2019s the same chart with FFIE overlaid onto the popular meme stock. Few traders discussed the cinema chain\u2019s post-Covid-19 recovery during AMC\u2019s second peak. To these brave speculators, the stock became a symbol of an \u201cApe\u201d movement that would last long after AMC\u2019s 2021 surge.\n\nThe Single Peak\n\nMeanwhile, other meme stocks decline without ever catching a second wind. Consider BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD), which briefly tripled in 2023 after announcing it would use OpenAI tools to help create content\u2026\n\nStory continues\n\nOr Genius Group (NYSEMKT:GNS), a Singapore-based firm that popularized the idea of investigating naked short sellers after appointing a former FBI director to lead a task force\u2026\n\nIn both of these cases, the companies themselves were the ones driving headlines. Meme investors never seemed to get as truly committed and quickly forgot about these companies once the news cycle moved on. These meme stocks had far less time in the spotlight\u2026 and less sustained momentum as a result.\n\nFFIE Stock: To the Moon or Straight to Zero?\n\nThat\u2019s worrying news for Faraday Future, a firm that has seen excitement disappear almost as quickly as it began. Since mid-May, search volumes for \u201cFFIE\u201d have fallen 86%, while \u201cFaraday Future\u201d volumes have yet to pick up.\n\nSocial media boards have also lacked significant chatter about super-normal returns. The company has no equivalent of Keith Gill to share screenshots of multimillion-dollar profits. Reddit\u2019s r/FFIE subreddit \u2014 a social media forum \u2014 turns decidedly negative any day shares go down.\n\nMost worryingly, consumers seem apathetic about Faraday\u2019s cars despite glowing performance reviews. The company has roughly 300 non-binding, fully refundable preorders, which is a rounding error compared to the 10,000 reservation figures that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) once sported. Most people on the street would fail to recognize a photo of a flagship Faraday FF91 SUV.\n\nThese issues are compounded by Faraday\u2019s publicity-shy management. In 2022, the company fired its media-savvy co-founder, Jia Yueting, after a scathing short report called him a \u201csecurities fraudster.\u201d The company has yet to find a suitable replacement, and Jia has even come back as an unofficial (and unwelcome) spokesperson for the company.\n\nThat suggests investors will quickly forget this meme stock\u2019s recent rise and fall. Faraday Future remains too small to have made ripples in the stock market, and the scant amount of cash left on hand suggests the company won\u2019t last much longer as a going concern even if meme investors pump the stock again.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com\u2019s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: Penny Stocks \u2014 How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Sell Before E-Trade Gives Roaring Kitty the Boot",
        "content": "Roaring Kitty brought meme stocks back to life. His first post in three years in mid-May caused GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares to triple in value almost overnight. It also dragged other left-for-dead meme stocks along for the ride.\n\nYet, the reaction to the meme lord (his real name is Keith Gill) by Wall Street was telling. The Wall Street Journal reported that discount broker E-Trade, owned by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), was mulling whether to ban him from the platform. The investment firm\u2019s financial crimes division was examining whether his options trades before his social media post were legal. The trades also came under scrutiny from the Securities & Exchange Commission and state securities agencies.\n\nWhile we can debate whether the video game retailer is a good investment \u2014 I tend to disagree with Gill \u2014 canceling him and prohibiting him from trading seems extreme.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t be up for debate is the meme stocks to sell below. These companies had no business jumping as they did. Gill wasn\u2019t recommending their shares, only GameStop. Traders were simply trying to revive the meme stock-buying frenzy of 2021.\n\nHere is why you should avoid these meme stocks to sell.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nMovie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) became every bit as much of a poster child for the meme stock trade as GameStop. Diehard loyalists deemed themselves \u201capes\u201d who would HODL (hold on for dear life) to AMC stock no matter what. Unfortunately, that hasn\u2019t amounted to much. Shares have lost 99% of their value from their high point three years ago.\n\nHowever, the Roaring Kitty social media post brought the stock back to life, and a better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report helped it hold onto its value. The movie theater stock has more than doubled from its April lows.\n\nYet better-than-expected does not necessarily mean good or sustainable. AMC Entertainment is still hurting because the movie industry remains in decline. Theater attendance is down as Hollywood forgot how to make blockbuster movies. This summer\u2019s lineup started with a dud, and there are only one or two films that have hopes of hitting it big.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bode well for AMC Entertainment going forward, making it the first meme stock to sell now.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) TRUTH SOCIAL application and logo displayed on smartphone. a social media application created by former US president Donald Trump after being blocked from Facebook. DJT stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) remain flat from where they were when the social media company of former President Donald Trump began trading on the Nasdaq exchange. Over the past month, though, the stock is down 30%. Expect it to continue being volatile.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the presidential campaign heats up heading into November\u2019s elections, investors are likely in for a roller coaster ride as the former president commands even more attention on the national stage. His Truth Social platform will be a key part of how Trump amplifies his message, which could determine whether it remains a viable business.\n\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t look good. Although Trump Media doesn\u2019t publish daily active user numbers, arguing they are not useful for a new platform, sites that track visits indicate usage is falling. While Trump has not really posted much on X (formerly Twitter), CEO Elon Musk will be hosting a town hall-style meeting with him on the platform. That draws attention away from Truth Social.\n\nUltimately, there is a very limited audience for the platform. Because of the president\u2019s polarizing personality, many won\u2019t use the site. It will primarily be for those committed to following Trump. While that\u2019s not necessarily bad, it also doesn\u2019t offer much hope for growth.\n\nAt $37 per share, there is a lot of air under Trump Media & Technology Group stock through which it can fall.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) An image of the logo for BlackBerry Ltd (BB).\n\nSource: BlackBerry\n\nOnce known for its revolutionary mobile handsets, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is a very different company today. It is now a security and software business, which, though offering critical services, is a shell of its former self. It is experiencing growth but not on a scale necessary to take on its larger, better-financed rivals. There is a niche for BlackBerry stock to exist but not much to make an investment out of.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s main business is cybersecurity. It offers secure communications platforms, endpoint control systems and analytics tools and services. The company is very much in the same vein as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), though on a dramatically smaller scale. It also tends to perform best in regulated markets, such as government, healthcare and financials, where security is paramount. But that could limit growth as well as expansion into other enterprise-class industries.\n\nBlackBerry also targets the auto industry with semiconductor, safety systems and cabin feature technologies. Despite its QNX operating system offering good growth prospects with original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and Tier 1 suppliers, it is the smaller of BlackBerry\u2019s two businesses.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s not a lot to expect from BlackBerry. It is a relatively small fish in a small pond. The stock is down 54% over the past year, and there do not appear to be any catalysts to reverse its course.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Short squeeze stocks are garnering attention once again, thanks to the re-emergence of Keith Gill, also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d a key figure in the original meme stock mania of 2020. The YouTube celebrity made a big investment in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock and returned after a three-year hiatus to spark the meme stock craze. Twenty thousand call options with a $20 strike price are about to expire, and five million common shares are included in this. GME jumped by more than 80% in pre-market trade as the markets reciprocated.\n\nAdditionally, AMC\u2019s (NYSE:AMC) stock has risen significantly, in part because of the renewed interest in meme stocks. The stock was still going up in early June, even though it had gone up 78% in one day in May, which led to renewed interest in short-squeeze stocks.\n\nBut, as we\u2019ll see, some short-squeeze stocks are companies that work in high-value fields, like the hydrogen fuel cell and plant-based food options sectors, working their way to navigate out of recent troubles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a prime candidate among short-squeeze stocks because it possesses all of the ingredients the meme stock community loves; it\u2019s down 73% in a year, operates in the highly lucrative hydrogen fuel industry, and isn\u2019t getting much analyst love.\n\nPLUG\u2019s sales for the first quarter of 2024 were $120.3 million, 42.8% less than the same time last year, and with a net loss of $295.77 million, PLUG is still not making any money.\n\nIn addition, Truist Securities recently cut its target price for PLUG from $6 to $3, while maintaining a \u201chold\u201d rating, adding to woes for a stock already down double digits this year with a short interest of 29.4%.\n\nPLUG, on the other hand, is actively trying to get more customers and funding in order to make good on analyst estimates and become profitable by 2026.\n\n\u200bThe Department of Energy is lending $1.66 billion to help construct six green hydrogen factory units. In addition, an unnamed \u201cmajor U.S. automobile manufacturer\u201d is working with Plug Power to provide fuel cells and build hydrogen infrastructure. Finally, PLUG is expanding its pipeline in the environmentally concerned continent of Europe by inking agreements for 350 megawatts of electrolyzers.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) A photograph of a vegetarian burger.\n\nSource: barmalini/Shutterstock.com\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is battling multiple fronts, with persistent inflation, a solitary rate cut this year, tough competition from Impossible Foods, and slowing plant-based meat revenues and volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to all of the above, BYND also didn\u2019t do any favors for itself by reporting an 18% fall in net sales and a net loss of $155.1 million. Despite these hurdles, Beyond Meat expects sales of $315 million to $345 million in 2024, but investors are not biting; the stock is down almost 50% in the past year, and short interest is 39.8%.\n\nTo overcome these challenges and boost profitability, BYND is increasing the number of options on its menu. Recently, it revealed Beyond IV, its fourth-generation Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef.\n\nAvocado oil cuts saturated fat by 75% compared to beef (in these goods). They include 20% less salt and 21 grams of protein per serving. In addition, the Beyond Burger and Beyond Crispy Nuggets are two new products BYND has added to its food service line.\n\nApart from these product introductions, BYND is also working actively on inventory optimization, which is why Beyond Jerky is being discontinued to concentrate on Beyond IV, which is more lucrative. BYND is also slashing its 2024 budget by $70 million as part of the SKU rationalization process.\n\nAurora Cannabis (ACB) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of cannabinoid company Aurora Cannabis (ACB, blurred marijuana leaf (focus on left part of letter R in center)\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock.com\n\nAurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB), much like other cannabis stocks, is a perennial name among short-squeeze stocks, primarily because, under federal law, marijuana is still illegal in America.\n\nOn the bright side, ACB reported its fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in its fiscal third quarter, thanks to quarterly net sales going up 5% to 64.4 million CAD. The Canadian licensed cannabis distributor is also cutting down on debt, recently repurchasing 23.1 million CAD in convertible debentures.\n\nAt the same time, not all is well, as revenue from consumer cannabis fell by 21% compared to last year, and adjusted SG&A expenses remained quite high at 27.5 million CAD in fiscal Q3 2024, which is under its 30 million CAD target.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a reverse stock split in February 2024 was supposed to consolidate shares and keep the price stable, but ACB stock is selling for $5.90, still a long way below its 52-week high of $11.5.\n\nCFO Glenn Ibbott also stepped down recently, though he\u2019s going to continue in an advisory role; following his departure, ACB stock fell once again.\n\nAll of these developments come as the Canadian market continues to face downward pressure, with recreational cannabis sales growing 2% in Q1 2024, down from 11% in the previous quarter, further ensuring ACB remains among short-squeeze stocks for some time to come.\u200b\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

This has been helped by positive remarks about GME stock by Roaring Kitty, the meme-stock investor and commentator.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut Roaring Kitty, who holds 120,000 call options on GME stock that expire on June 21, is likely focused on obtaining large, short-term gains from his involvement with the name. While it\u2019s true that he also owns 5 million shares of GameStop, he can quickly sell that position as well.\n\nAnd speaking of unloading the company\u2019s shares, CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s stake in the firm has dropped to 8.6%, versus 10.5% last month. Cohen\u2019s decision to sell a large number of the company\u2019s shares does not bode well for its longer-term outlook.\n\nAnother negative for GME is the fact that GameStop recently sold an additional $2.14 billion of its shares. And the 29% decline in the firm\u2019s first-quarter revenue versus the same period a year earlier likewise makes me more bearish on the name.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is another meme name. However, the momentum of AMC stock appears to have greatly weakened in recent weeks. After hitting a recent high of $11.88 at the beginning of the meme-stock revival, the stock price is now not much higher than the $4.54 low it on March 15.\n\nMeanwhile, another InvestorPlace columnist, Rich Duprey, recently reported that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, one of this year\u2019s summer blockbusters, probably won\u2019t be profitable. That indicates that the film isn\u2019t drawing a large number of viewers, boding poorly for AMC\u2019s Q2 performance. Duprey believes that two other movies due out soon, Deadpool & Wolverine and Despicable Me 4, will perform better at the box office. Still, as he points out, \u201d\u00a0it\u2019s tough to run a business on just a pair of hits every year.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd as I noted in a recent column, the company\u2019s attendance in the U.S. dropped 5.8% in Q1 year-over-year. Meanwhile, it burned a huge $268 million of cash in the 12 months that ended in March.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it\u2019s clear that AMC\u2019s fundamentals are quite poor.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese e-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is facing very tough competition on multiple fronts.\n\nBABA stock is being threatened by the rapid growth of two other Chinese e-commerce firms, JD.com ( NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). Alibaba\u2019s share of the Chinese e-commerce market tumbled to 37% last year from 80% in 2017.\n\nBloomberg recently noted that Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit slashed its prices by as much as 97%. The company even lowered the prices that it charges for nine of its artificial intelligence-powered offerings.\n\nIn Q1, Alibaba\u2019s EBITDA fell to $4.82 billion from $4.97 billion during the same period a year earlier.\n\nGiven these points, BABA stock definitely belongs on everyone\u2019s list of growth stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Robinhood Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Finding the most undervalued Robinhood stocks isn\u2019t as difficult a task as you might expect. The trading platform is often thought of as a place for traders to buy meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). And to be clear, both stocks are among the 100 most popular stocks on the platform. However, a look at the most popular stocks on Robinhood shows a much more conventional group of equities.\n\nThis is significant because according to data from finder.com, Robinhood (NYSE:HOOD) had over 23.6 million funded customers globally as of February 2024. Of those, the company reported 10.9 million monthly active users at the end of 2023. That\u2019s significantly higher than its nearest competitor, even if the average account value is only around $4,000.\n\nThe takeaway is that many Robinhood investors are far more conventional in their taste for stocks than you might think. And that means looking for stocks trading at a discount. Here are three undervalued Robinhood stocks that have been poor performers in the last year but offer significant upside for the rest of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been a lackluster performer for several years. In the last five years, the total return on JNJ stock is 29%. And in the last 12 months, the stock\u2019s total return is loss of 4.3%. Some of the lack of interest is because the company spun off its consumer products division into Kenvue (NYSE:VUE).\n\nWhat\u2019s left deserves a closer look. The streamlined JNJ consists of two business units: Innovative Medicines and Medtech. In both areas, the company has significant announcements that could drive the business higher.\n\nOn May 31, Johnson & Johnson completed its acquisition of Shockwave Medical. This gives JNJ access to Shockwave\u2019s exclusive intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) platform that is approved for coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD).\n\nOn the Innovative Medicines front, Johnson & Johnson completed its $2 billion acquisition of Ambrx in March. This increases its exposure to antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) which are an area of heavy investment in the pharmaceutical space.\n\nJNJ stock has a consensus \u201cbuy\u201d rating with a price target of $171.77, a gain of approximately 16%. And that goes along with a dividend that yields 3.4% and has been increasing for 62 consecutive years.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been another difficult hold over the last few years. The total return for SBUX in the last five years is 9.5%. And in the past 12 months, it\u2019s been one of the worst-performing stocks with a total loss of 14.8%. But in the last month, the stock is bouncing higher which may signal that it\u2019s reached the \u201cso bad it\u2019s good stage.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat would make investors believe that? First, look at China. In December 2023, the company projected double-digit revenue growth in the country in 2024. This was fueled by new store expansion and strong comparable sales. This is contradicted a little bit by the company\u2019s latest earnings report in which it forecast a full-year single-digit revenue decline in China. The truth may wind up being somewhere in between.\n\nHowever, a much simpler look may come from the company\u2019s revenue and earnings. In the first two quarters of the 2024 fiscal year were on par, if not slightly better than 2023. That could be why SBUX stock gets a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating from eight out of 32 analysts.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Let Shopify Stock Finish Cooling off Before You Invest\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is last on this list of undervalued Robinhood stocks. The stock is down more than 20% in 2024, and retail investors are polarized about its future.\n\nThe bulls point to the company\u2019s investment in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) tools as e-commerce moves into the metaverse. They also see the company\u2019s year-over-year revenue and earnings growth as a bullish sign. On the other hand, naysayers will point out that year-over-year revenue is slowing. That wouldn\u2019t be what you want to see from a growing tech stock.\n\nHowever, analysts seem to be much less ambivalent about SHOP stock. Out of 47 analysts, 25 give the stock either a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d and there\u2019s no rating lower than \u201chold.\u201d They also are forecasting earnings growth of over 50%, which would support a higher stock price. That means investors may want to view the recent bounce off of a level around $56 as a signal to catch a rally in this undervalued stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Over-Hyped Stocks to Sell Before They Plunge: June Edition",
        "content": "Admittedly, bailing on over-hyped stocks to sell can seem like a regretful move in the near-term. Flying in the face of the Wall Street adage \u201clet your winners run,\u201d it\u2019s common to feel regretful when you sell said hot stocks, only to see them get even hotter and head higher.\n\nYet, while it may at first seem like you are leaving money on the table selling, exiting from stocks benefiting heavily from hope and hype right now could prove to be a shrewd move in hindsight. The latest meme wave, driven by famed meme stock investor Keith (Roaring Kitty) Gill is clearly fading.\n\nThe popularity of AI stocks has benefited from a resurgence lately. But it\u2019s unclear whether fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) about the future growth for this space will soon emerge once again. Atop this, momentum plays are at risk of running out of runway, as concerns about higher for longer interest rates and other macro factors continue to climb.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, it may be high time to take profit, with the following seven over-hyped stocks to sell.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may not be the first \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stock that comes to mind when you think over-hyped. But, consider how much the tech giant still has to prove, when it comes to capitalizing on the generative artificial intelligence (AI) growth trend.\n\nYes, AAPL stock could keep surging, if the company makes a splash with its AI unveiling at this week\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). However, pretty soon, concerns about Apple iPhone sales could once again start to overshadow the AI hype. As I recently argued, weak iPhone demand, especially in China, threatens to continue affecting the company\u2019s overall fiscal performance and growth.\n\nWith shares currently changing hands a pricey 30 times forward earnings, a shift in sentiment back to bearish may mean a massive de-rating ahead for AAPL. Trading in the $190s today, shares could easily retest their 52-week low of $164.08 per share, or worse, head back to even lower prices. If this was merely a story of Apple doing okay overall, but possibly getting an extra boost from AI mania, it would be a different story. Yet as iPhone headwinds remain, selling existing positions into strength is the better move.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) has once again become one one of the most over-hyped stocks to sell. Yes, AI has not only benefited from the latest resurgences in AI and meme stock popularity. Alongside this, the enterprise AI software company recently released an earnings report that was well-received by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, longstanding concerns have not gone away completely for AI stock. Although growth last quarter re-accelerated year-over-year (YOY) and quarter-over-quarter (QOQ), it\u2019s unclear how much C3.ai\u2019s rate of growth will increase, as it completes its transition to a subscription-based revenue model. Another question that remains unanswered is when the company will become consistently profitable. Sell-side forecasts still call for net losses to persist through 2026.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the short side of the trade with AI remains very crowded, at around 31.9% of outstanding float. Any sort of stumble in the coming quarters, with growth and/or with its path to profitability, could lead to a severe correction for shares. Given the many other fundamentally-strong AI plays, why mess around with C3.ai?\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) briefly gained from the aforementioned Roaring Kitty rally. Yet, as meme mania heads into the sunset once again, a further sell-off likely awaits for this former \u201cmeme king.\u201d\n\nWhy? As Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently argued, AMC stock is caught in a lose-lose situation. First, consider movie theater attendance, amid the industry continuing to make a sluggish post-Covid19 recovery. This is a factor outside of management\u2019s control but key for AMC\u2019s financial health. Second, with this underwhelming industry recovery, AMC is struggling to experience the rebound in necessary profitability to pay down debt through cash flow.\n\nAs a result, the company faces a tough choice. AMC can either continue to dilute shareholders to raise equity, or simply contend with continued net losses, which will further call into question the stock\u2019s valuation. To add to Navellier\u2019s bearish points, consider the fact that there\u2019s a much better movie theater play out there: Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK). CNK is profitable and trades at a reasonable 14.2 times forward earnings.\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) a private plane inside a hangar is prepared for a flight. represent aerospace stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) is another that may be controversial to consider as one of the over-hyped stocks to sell. After all, it\u2019s not as if GE has surged because of \u201cmeme mania\u201d or \u201cAI mania.\u201d Rather, investors have bid up the former conglomerate, now aerospace pure play, for other reasons.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the bullish narrative being disseminated regarding GE stock. Per the bulls, as safety concerns with Boeing (NYSE:BA) affect delivery of enough new aircraft to meet demand, existing aircraft are likely to stay in the skies longer than previously anticipated. This means more demand for parts and maintenance \u2013 good news for aerospace suppliers like GE.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible that the market is overestimating how much this will affect GE\u2019s growth and profitability going forward. How so? Take a look at GE\u2019s forward valuation. Shares today trade at 40 times forward earnings, a high multiple for an \u201cold economy\u201d industrial stock. If the above-mentioned tailwinds aren\u2019t as strong as expected, GE could go from a high flier to a stock facing heavy turbulence.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilar to the situation with GE Aerospace, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is another potential case of the market putting the cart before the horse regarding a growth catalyst. Actually, two growth catalysts exist. That is, this pharma firm is sitting pretty, with the success of its diabetes and weight-loss treatment Mounjaro.\n\nAlongside Mounjaro is another promising candidate in the pipeline that\u2019s driving heavy hype for LLY stock right now. That would be donanemab, Lilly\u2019s candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Per analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, donanemab is a mega-blockbuster drug in the making. By 2030, it may have 50% of a $13 billion per year Alzheimer\u2019s drug market.\n\nEven so, consider that LLY trades for around 61.8 times forward earnings. There\u2019s validity in questioning whether or not both these growth catalysts are already baked into the stock\u2019s valuation. After more than doubling in price since early 2023, at best, further gains for Eli Lilly shares could be far less stellar. At worst, disappointment could lead to a massive reversal. If you bought in before hope and hype for Mounjaro and donanemab took shape, consider it high time to take profit.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Silhouette man using smartphone with Reddit (RDDT) logo on blurred background is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) has been rallying lately, and not for reasons you may think. This rally has coincided with the recent resurgence in popularity of meme stocks. However, it\u2019s not as if investors have bought RDDT just because its eponymous social media platform is heavily associated with the trend.\n\nRather, investors have bid up RDDT stock, in large part due to AI-related news. On May 16, the company announced a collaboration with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. As a result of this partnership, Reddit content will be made available to ChatGPT. In addition, new AI features will be integrated into Reddit\u2019s platform. Even so, it\u2019s not as if this is a surprise development.\n\nAs I discussed in an article on RDDT shortly after its IPO earlier this year, AI licensing was one of several potential catalysts hyped up at its public market debut. So before this recent rally, RDDT\u2019s valuation may have already factored-in this catalyst. Hence, it\u2019s very possible that once the market digests this news, RDDT, one of the over-hyped stocks to sell, falls back from nearly $60 per share, back on down to the low-$40s per share.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy. TSLA stock. stocks that could be the next Tesla\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwo months back, it seemed as if Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was en route back on down to multi-year lows. However, since then, shares in the electric vehicle (EV) maker have bounced back. Namely, this is due to renewed hope and hype regarding one of the company\u2019s sexier growth catalysts, the Robotaxi.\n\nOther developments have contributed to this warming back up in enthusiasm about TSLA stock. However, don\u2019t assume that the renewed bullish sentiment will continue. Pretty soon, concerns could be back on the radar of investors, such as Tesla\u2019s sales and margin issues. Recent vehicle shipment data and fiscal results suggest that the company is struggling in China. Also, Tesla may be facing trouble in the European EV market as well.\n\nTesla may consider itself a \u201ctech company that happens to build cars,\u201d but if its bread-and-butter automotive division keeps on struggling, look out below. It\u2019s only a matter of time before investors realize that paying 70 times earnings for a cyclical automaker makes little sense, especially as more promising EV stocks, like BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), trade at far less steep valuations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Despite the challenging macroeconomic landscape, investors are buying meme stocks as companies gain popularity again through social media and online communities. May was a particularly interesting month for meme maniacs following \u201cRoaring Kitty\u2019s\u201d return after over three years. Gains were small compared to 2021, but this may change soon.\n\nEarlier this week, the short-squeeze influencer Keith Gill scheduled a live stream for Friday, June 7, for the first time since 2021. The announcement sent GameStop (NYSE:GME) soaring. Then, an unconfirmed X post revealed Gill\u2019s stake in GME stock valued at $586 million, which added to momentum.\n\nGameStop will report its earnings on Tuesday, June 12. If it beats estimates, which seem more important than in 2021, it could act as a positive catalyst for other meme stocks. If played with caution, this may offer meme maniacs opportunities to squeeze out profits from the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne way to identify which meme stocks may benefit is to look back at those impacted in 2021. However, this is a rather risky endeavor. Based on historical precedent, meme stocks with the highest short-squeeze potential have a better chance of soaring.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three meme stocks combining short-squeeze potential and other factors, like institutional holdings or positive news, that are ready to join the rally.\n\nMedical Properties Trust (MPW) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nSource: venusvi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) has an exceptionally high short interest, at 35% of its total shares and float. Covering all short positions would require ten days, representing a risk for short sellers in case of a positive catalyst. With a substantial number of 206 million shares shorted, the MPW stock may be the next meme stock sensation.\n\nA few days ago, Medical Properties Trust announced a dividend yield of 11.19%. Despite being marginally lower than before, it is still nearly twice the industry average of 6.96%. This positive catalyst could present a significant upside as the stock price has gained over 60% since its low in January. While trading 77% below its all-time high, this signals a potential turnaround.\n\nDespite being involved in Steward\u2019s bankruptcy and rent collection issues, the company holds a niche position as a healthcare REIT that may offer stability and growth. It recently secured an $800 million loan backed by U.K. hospital properties to extend debt maturities and nourish more financial flexibility going forward. But investors may not have caught up on all that just as yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nCinemark (CNK) Cinemark movie theatre location in the Louis Joliet Mall in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nSource: LukeandKarla.Travel / Shutterstock.com\n\nCinema operator Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) has seen its stock price perform much better than meme stock AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). CNK stock appears to have over 24.8% of its float shorted and just nine days to cover. Despite short interest dropping 6.8% in the prior month to 27 million shares, high institutional ownership of 131% of its float presents conditions for a potentially severe short squeeze.\n\nOn the plus side, the company recently reported a net income of $25 million and adjusted EBITDA of $71 million with a healthy 12.2% margin. It ended the quarter with $789 million in cash and commitments to open 36 new screens over the next two years while peers outperformed. Management\u2019s solid execution during a challenging environment impacted by strikes could trigger a rush by short sellers to cover their positions.\n\nTrading at a 63% discount to its record high of $45 while putting in quite a performance 20% higher year-to-date (YTD) signals a potential turnaround. CNK\u2019s high beta of 2.25 and low P/E ratio of 11.79x compared to the industry\u2019s 18.74x make it one of the potentially undervalued meme stocks ready to get squeezed.\n\nKohl\u2019s Corp (KSS) Image of Kohl's logo on a Kohl's store\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nKohl\u2019s Corp (NYSE:KSS) presents a strong case for being one of the next meme stocks susceptible to a short squeeze. It has a very high short interest of 23% of its total shares and 33.7% of its float shorted. In fact, 36.36 million of its shares are shorted, and this number may increase. With approximately 125% of its float held by institutions, it\u2019s prone to a conditional short squeeze.\n\nDespite reporting a net loss for the quarter, the company managed to grow gross margins and reduce inventory. This may improve investor confidence and attract more buyers. Moreover, Kohl\u2019s Corp redeemed $113 million in notes in May and plans to stay committed to returning shareholder value with a solid quarterly dividend of 8.40%.\n\nTrading 73% below its all-time high, KSS stock has significant upside potential if sentiment improves. Its P/E ratio of 9.62x is half the industry average of 18x, presenting undervaluation and an attractive play for speculative gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Hedge funds have become wary of retail investors and have incorporated more social listening to manage the risk associated with short positions. But there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity for meme stock rallies to emulate the success of old favorites. The following are likely to play a key role in a meme stock resurgence this year.\n\nGameStop (GME)\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany stocks have been the subject of meme investor interest. But none have managed to become so synonymous with the investment strategy quite as much as GameStop (NYSE:GME).\n\nMuch of GameStop\u2019s fame in recent years comes from its famous, or infamous depending on your stance, short squeeze in January 2021. That resulted in a seismic rally which saw the stock catapult over 1,500% in the span of three weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDriving this rally was Keith Gill, a stock market influencer who became a cheerleader for the stock. Despite its sharp 2021 rally and collapse from its peak market capitalization of around $28 billion, Gill has allegedly retained his stake in the video game retailer. And, he recently posted a screenshot that showed the investor held $116m worth of GME shares. In total, Gill holds around 2% of all GameStop shares.\n\nThe fame of the 2021 meme stock rally has sent Keith Gill\u2019s followers on X to 1.4 million, while the Reddit group r/WallStreetBets now has 16 million members. This stronger united front among retail investors could see future GameStop rallies command far more interest.\n\nWhat about the stock\u2019s fundamentals? GameStop\u2019s performance is a mixed bag. The retailer announced a 19.44% drop in revenue to $1.8 billion in its Q1 of 2024 earnings compared to the year prior but a 30.91% jump in profit to $63.1 million.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile GameStop commands most limelight when it comes to discussing meme stocks, it\u2019s actually AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) that underwent the strongest rally in 2021.\n\nDuring its peak in June 2021, AMC\u2019s year-to-date (YTD) growth surpassed 2,600% in a short squeeze that spanned more than a month.\n\nCrucially, we\u2019ve seen plenty of evidence that AMC Entertainment is strategic. The company knows how to cash in on retail interest and use it to generate a more sustainable business model.\n\nDuring its 2021 rally, AMC opted to use its growth to build a $2 billion war chest focused on cinema upgrades and new leases. Also, the company announced shareholder perks like free popcorn to encourage investors to hold the stock for longer.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, AMC Entertainment\u2019s 2024 rally has been no different. The cinema chain raised around $250 million of new equity capital through the sale of 72.5 million shares in an at-the-market equity offering launched in March.\n\nIn addition, AMC posted relatively resilient Q1 earnings for the year, with total revenues decreasing slightly by 0.3% to $951.4 million. Also standing out was a significant improvement in net loss to $163.5 million, a reduction of $72 million over the previous year.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the other stocks on this list, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has so far failed to ignite retail interest in 2024. The stock experienced a weaker 2021 rally and suffered losses of almost 20% over the first two quarters of this year.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s fall from grace has also been the most jarring. The mobile phone manufacturer had a strong market presence until it failed to adapt to the age of the smartphone and Apple\u2019s iPhone dominance. This has made the stock a popular choice among meme investors for its nostalgic qualities.\n\nHowever, BlackBerry may be an example of a meme stock that can double up as an innovative tech firm once again. June 2024 saw BlackBerry announce a partnership with Databricks to deliver strong AI and data-focused solutions in the world of cybersecurity.\n\nAlso, the firm\u2019s Q1 revenue of $373 million points to a stock that has plenty of room for growth should it begin to enter the artificial intelligence (AI) market with next-generation solutions across different industries.\n\nTherefore, BlackBerry may have long been the meme stock that\u2019s lacking the same level of retail love shown to the likes of GameStop and AMC Entertainment. However, its commitment to embracing emerging technology could add more value as a buy option for retail investors ahead of a prospective 2024 market rally.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Ready for Quick Gains? 7 Top Short-Squeeze Stocks to Watch Now",
        "content": "Retail investor interest in short squeeze stocks has grown considerably since the \u201cmeme stock\u201d phenomenon of 2021. However, a stock doesn\u2019t need to gain the \u201cmeme king\u201d popularity of a GameStop (NYSE:GME) or an AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) to become a profitable squeeze trade for investors.\n\nIn many situations, all it takes is two things. First, a high level of short interest. What constitutes high short interest? Think 20%, 30%, 40%, or more of outstanding float sold short.\n\nSecond, to trigger a squeeze, typically what\u2019s required is the announcement of unforeseen positive news about the heavily-shorted stock in question. Why? As a sweeping development changes the story behind a stock, the crowded short-side scrambles to cover positions, causing the \u201csqueeze\u201d to occur.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are seven stocks that currently have a high level of short interest, and that based on various factors, could become short squeeze stocks in the near-future.\n\nArbor Realty Trust (ABR) the Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) logo on a web browser, magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nArbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership of commercial and residential mortgages. REITs like Arbor are often referred to as mortgage REITs (mREITs). With the surge in interest rates putting the squeeze on mREIT net interest margins, Wall Street\u2019s \u201csmart money\u201d has been betting against many major names in the space.\n\nABR stock is no exception. Far from it, in fact. Short interest currently totals 41% of outstanding float. A big reason why Arbor Realty Trust in particular has been a short-seller target may have to do with the myriad of allegations laid against the mREIT, by vocal short seller Viceroy Research. However, Arbor\u2019s management has refuted these allegations. Not only that, Arbor has clearly been successful in navigating sector challenges.\n\nAs Seeking Alpha commentator Larry Hall noted last month, the mREIT\u2019s management has been successful at mitigating risk, maintaining Arbor\u2019s profitability, and more importantly, its dividend. While not certain, a continuation of this resilience could prove Viceroy and the rest of the shorts wrong, perhaps turning ABR into one of the short squeeze stocks. In the meantime, contrarians can sit back and collect ABR\u2019s 12.13% dividend.\n\nKohl\u2019s (KSS) Image of Kohl's logo on a Kohl's store\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nIn prior coverage of Kohl\u2019s (NYSE:KSS), I\u2019ve taken a bearish stance on the department store chain\u2019s shares. Largely, due to the risk of a posssible dividend cut down the road. At current prices, KSS sports a forward dividend yield of 8.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, as inflation and soft demand decimate bricks and mortar retail profitability, it may prove challenging to sustain this high level of payout. I\u2019m clearly not the only one leaning bearish about the future prospect of KSS stock. Shares are among the most heavily-shorted, with short interest totaling 33.58% of outstanding float. Having said all of this, with shares back down near pandemic-era levels, the worst may just well now be fully priced into KSS, and then some.\n\nThe latest plunge for Kohl\u2019s shares happened late last month, following the company\u2019s latest earnings release. The retailer reported an unexpected loss, and provided weak guidance for the full year. However, if next quarter or a few quarters from now, Kohl\u2019s reports \u201cbetter than feared\u201d numbers, or if an improving macro backdrop leads to an upward revision to forecasts? It\u2019s easy to see KSS getting squeezed back to higher prices.\n\nMedical Properties Trust (MPW) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nSource: venusvi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is a stock that in hindsight I was overly bearish about. While the healthcare-focused REIT had its share of big issues and risks, looking back it\u2019s clear that said issues were more than accounted for, with MPW is stuck in \u201cpenny stock territory,\u201d or at prices below $5 per share.\n\nAlthough playing out gradually, one can say that the MPW stock has been one of the short squeeze stocks this year. Promising news regarding a problem tenant, along with other positive developments has helped to boost bullishness and increase confidence that Medical Properties Trust can maintain its current dividend. At today\u2019s prices, MPW\u2019s quarterly dividend gives the stock a forward yield of 10.66%.\n\nBut even after benefiting from a slow-and-steady squeeze, additional spikes could be in the cards for MPW. Short interest remains very high, at 35.07% of outstanding float. Tenant issues could continue to enter the rearview mirror. The REIT could also make further progress assuaging concerns about debt, through efforts like its recent $800 million refinancing. In the next earnings release, stronger-than-expected results and upbeat guidance may result in yet another squeeze for shares.\n\nPhathom Pharmaceuticals (PHAT) Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock\n\nBiotech firm Phathom Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PHAT) develops and commercializes treatment for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The key candidate in Phathom\u2019s pipeline is Voquenza. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Larry Ramer noted last month, the company has already obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Voquenza\u2019s use as a treatment for erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\nHowever, as Ramer also noted, obtaining approval for Voquenza as a treatment for non-erosive GERD will be the real needle-moving catalyst for PHAT stock, if it happens. The short-side clearly does not think it will happen. That\u2019s why short interest for PHAT currently stands at 28.21% of outstanding float. Yet while this skepticism may suggest high uncertainty over FDA approval, the risk could be far outweighed by the upside if Voquenza gets the non-erosive GERD green light.\n\nPHAT has cratered in price since 2021, when it traded for prices north of $45 per share. With millions of Americans being treated for acid-related stomach issues, label expansion for Voquenza, selling for $650 per 30-dose bottle, could make it a blockbuster drug. This, coupled with the short squeezing that\u2019s likely to occur upon gaining non-erosive GERD regulatory approval, could send PHAT back toward prior price levels.\n\nChildren\u2019s Place (PLCE) Outside view of a the Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE) storefront\n\nSource: rblfmr/Shutterstock.com\n\nChildren\u2019s Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) is a stock that I have previously noted as having high squeeze potential. Last August, I argued that stronger results could send PLCE, then trading at around $27 per share, back up to triple-digit price levels. Unfortunately, better results have thus far failed to arrive.\n\nInstead of rising fourfold, PLCE stock has instead fallen by around 57.4%. Yet while I clearly made the wrong call, it may have just been a case of taking a bullish stance way too early. It\u2019s important to note that, while down considerably from last year, PLCE stock has bounced back strongly from its 52-week low of $6.58 per share. Mostly, due to Mithaq Capital, PLCE\u2019s majority shareholder, providing the company with more liquidity to fund its e-commerce transformation.\n\nThe short side may stay crowded for now, with nearly a quarter of PLCE\u2019s outstanding float sold short. However, much like the aforementioned Mithaq news caused an extended squeeze during April and May, similarly-positive developments may results in similarly outsized moves higher for hard-hit PLCE shares.\n\nB Riley (RILY) a magnifying glass enlarges the B. Riley (RILY) logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nB. Riley (NASDAQ:RILY) is another name better described as one of the short squeeze stocks, rather than a short squeeze stock in the making. Back in late April, shares in this heavily-shorted investment bank and holding company went to the moon, thanks to a legal-related announcement.\n\nThe reason why so many investors were betting against RILY stock, had to do with B. Riley\u2019s association with a financier currently facing allegations of securities fraud. To address and remedy this issue, B. Riley initiated an independent investigation. On April 24, this investigation concluded that there was no involvement or knowledge on B. Riley\u2019s part, in the financier\u2019s alleged activities. As a result, shares surged, as the long side squeezed the short side out of positions.\n\nShort interest with RILY has come down since then, but remains at very elevated levels. Currently, short interest totals 51.8% of outstanding float. B. Riley has also given back much of its short squeeze gains, yet I wouldn\u2019t rule out a possible further squeezing down the road. Back in April, InvestorPlace\u2019s Steve Booyens noted many potential growth opportunities for B. Riley\u2019s investment banking unit. Fiscal results for the company could improve, sparking additional squeezes higher.\n\nVital Energy (VTLE) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buy. Oil & Gas Stocks to Avoid\n\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nVital Energy (NYSE:VTLE) is an independent energy exploration and production (E&P) company. Vital\u2019s focus is mainly on oil and gas projects located in the Permian Basin region of the southwestern United States.\n\nThe Permian of course contains one of the richest deposits of fossil fuels in the U.S., and Vital is generating significant cash flow from its operations. Even so, this hasn\u2019t stopped VTLE stock from having a crowded short side. Short interest currently totals 31.97% of outstanding float. One reason as to why the shorts are betting against Vital may have to do with the E&P\u2019s highly-leveraged balance sheet. The company has around $2.24 billion in outstanding long-term debt.\n\nHowever, with Vital increasing production, organically and through acquisitions, it\u2019s not just wishful thinking that\u2019s driving sell-side forecasts calling for major earnings growth next year. If it becomes more clear that results will live up to these forecasts, which call for 31.6% earnings growth next year, VTLE could soon become one of the short squeeze stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you\u2019re curious about the legitimacy of WallStreetBets stock picks, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Three of the worst WallStreetBets stock picks you can own are GameStop (NYSE:GME)., Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). The three meme stocks had 14, 14, and three mentions over the past 24 hours preceding June 1.\n\nWhile the WSB community discusses many poor-quality stocks, it also discusses a number of great companies. For example, the number one WSB stock by mentions in the past day at the time of writing is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), with 244 mentions, almost 100 more than the second-place stock, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThat\u2019s an excellent business, and if you hold it for 3-5 years or more, you\u2019ll likely make money on the AI game-changer. However, the WSB investor community has discussed other good businesses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three other WallStreetBets with excellent potential for massive gains. To keep it interesting, I\u2019ll keep my suggestions outside the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWallStreetBets Stock Picks: Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) had the third-highest mentions over the past 24 hours, with 82, which was 57% less than the previous day.\n\nThe company is one of the world\u2019s leaders in digital payments. You would have to live in a cave not to know its name. During fiscal year 2023 (September year-end), Visa processed 213 billion payments and cash transactions under its brand.\n\nIn Q2 2024, it generated $8.8 billion in revenue, 10% higher year-over-year, and $5.1 billion in non-GAAP earnings, 17% higher than Q2 2023. It processed 72.08 billion transactions during the quarter, with debit accounting for 66% and credit for 34%.\n\nThe company continues to be shareholder-friendly, returning $3.8 billion in capital to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past decade, it\u2019s reduced its share count by nearly one-fifth. As Warren Buffett often says about share repurchases, your ownership position grows without investing a single new dollar in the company.\n\nOver the past three years, Visa has grown its revenue and net income on an annualized basis by 14.34% and 16.71%, respectively. Despite a corporate history that dates back 66 years, it\u2019s still growing by double digits.\n\nWhile Visa only generated an annualized total return of 6.90% over the past three years, its return over the past 15 years is nearly three times higher. It\u2019s due for better returns.\n\nInvesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) Invesco logo in blue with mountain image\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQM) wasn\u2019t mentioned, but its stablemate, the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), was. QQQ had the fourth-highest mentions over the past 24 hours at the time of writing, with 64, 33% less than the previous day.\n\nI said I\u00a0wouldn\u2019t recommend one of the Mag 7. I didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t pick an ETF that holds one or more of them. QQQM tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, a collection of 100 of the largest non-financial companies trading on the Nasdaq.\n\nAlthough QQQ has existed since March 1999, QQQM was only launched in October 2020 to allow buy-and-hold investors to own the index at a lower cost \u2014 5 basis points cheaper at 0.15%- and with an ETF structure rather than a unit trust. This allows QQQM to reinvest dividends and lend its stock to short sellers.\n\nAll seven of the Mag 7 are in the ETF\u2019s top 10 holdings, which account for 49% of its $26 billion in net assets. The two stocks not part of the Mag 7 and in the top 10 are Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST), my third pick.\n\nThere is no question that QQQM is a tech-focused fund, with nearly 59% of the net assets allocated to this sector. The next two sectors with the highest weight are consumer discretionary (17.9%) and health care (6.29%).\n\nThe downside of QQQM is that it\u2019s not nearly as liquid. However, its 30-day average daily volume of 1.58 million is plenty should you need to sell some shares quickly.\n\nIf you want Mag 7 stocks without as much risk, QQQM is a good option. Kudos to WSB members for understanding this.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco had the 19th-highest number of mentions over the past 24 hours, with 10, which was 85% less than the previous day.\n\nThe late Charlie Munger thought the membership-based warehouse discount retailer was the greatest business. Sure, he served on the board for 26 years, from 1997 until his death last November, but he believed in its business model.\n\n\u201c\u2018I love everything about Costco,\u2019 Munger said during The Daily Journal\u2019s annual shareholder meeting back in February, \u2018I\u2019m a total addict, and I\u2019m never going to sell a share,\u2019\u201d Yahoo Finance reported shortly after Munger\u2019s death.\n\nHow often do you hear a corporate director in an S&P 500 company talk that way about the company whose board he sits on? Very few, but Munger always spoke his mind, so when he said something, if you were smart, you listened and followed his lead.\n\nI\u2019ve been a big believer for years. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever encountered a miserable Costco employee. They\u2019re always smiling as they go about their work days, which isn\u2019t easy given how many customers they check out daily. You can\u2019t fake that enthusiasm. It\u2019s contagious.\n\nOf course, there is the business model, which strives for the lowest prices possible while making most of its profit from annual membership fees.\n\nFurther, in 2023 (September year-end), its revenue from membership fees was $4.58 billion, or 73% of its $6.29 billion in net income. In 2013, its revenue from membership fees was $2.29 billion, or 112% of its net income. That\u2019s a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% over the past decade.\n\nWhat\u2019s not to love?\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nWill Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

But the issues were resolved towards the end of the session, and trading resumed as normal.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,300.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1 to 18,662.50 points by 19:23 ET (23:23 GMT). Dow Jones Futures steadied at 38,668.0 points.\n\nRate cut speculation increases amid weak economic data\n\nInvestors were seen ramping up bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September, as a swathe of recent readings showed the U.S. economy was cooling.\n\nThe CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in a 52.5% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, up from a 47% chance seen yesterday.\n\nPurchasing managers index data for May showed manufacturing activity slowed for a second straight month, with the reading coming just days after U.S. gross domestic product data was revised lower in the first quarter.\n\nFocus this week is on key nonfarm payrolls data, with the labor market being another major consideration for the Fed in cutting rates. JOLTS job openings data is due on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed is also set to meet next week and keep rates steady.\n\nBut before the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada are both widely expected to cut interest rates this week.\n\nWall Street buoyed by Nvidia on new AI chips\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% to finish at 5,283.40 points on Monday, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.6% to 16,828.63 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 38,71.03 points.\n\nTechnology stocks- chiefly NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), were the biggest supporter of Wall Street. The chipmaker surged nearly 5% on Monday and was close to record highs in aftermarket trade, after it unveiled a new line of processors for artificial intelligence.\n\nIts smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 2% even after it unveiled new AI chips aimed at competing with Nvidia.\n\nGameStop surges as influencer Roaring Kitty reveals $116 mln bet\n\nGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) closed 21% higher at $28.0 after surging as much as 78% on Monday.

        "content": "VIX Spikes 8% As Stocks Sink; Bonds, Gold Rise On Growth Concerns; Meme Stocks Roar, Peso Plummets: What's Driving Markets Monday?\n\nAll major U.S. equity indices opened the week with losses, as traders shifted to safe-haven bonds and gold amid concerns affecting the health of the U.S. manufacturing activity. In May, the ISM Manufacturing PMI dropped to 48.7, marking a faster-than-expected contraction.\n\nThis follows a bleak Chicago PMI report on Friday, which indicated the worst sentiment since May 2020.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), known as the market fear gauge, surged by 9% on a day marred by temporary technical glitches affecting several NYSE-listed stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG).\n\nAt 12:40 p.m. in New York, the Nasdaq 100 index was down 0.5%, eyeing its fourth consecutive session of declines, potentially marking its longest losing streak since early January 2024.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed tech-heavy indices due to sharp losses in the energy and industrials sectors, weighing down the blue-chip index.\n\nTreasury yields fell nearly 10 basis points, marking the highest one-day decline in yields since May 15 and the third-largest drop of the year. Bond-related assets surged, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) gaining 1.2%, aiming for its third consecutive day of gains.\n\nAs yields dropped, gold rose by 0.9%, fully recovering Friday\u2019s losses, while Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was up by 2.3%.\n\nMonday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Nasdaq 100 18,443.91 -0.5% S&P 500 5,248.61 -0.5% Russell 2000 2,050.97 -0.9% Dow Jones 38,285.51 -1.0%\n\nUpdated at 12:48 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 0.6% lower to $524.01.

        "content": "Mid-May saw a round of meme stock rallies when Keith Gill, a.k.a Roaring Kitty, made a surprise return \u2014 in true meme fashion \u2014 on social media. Roaring Kitty is the trader from Massachusetts who instigated the infamous meme stock breakout in 2021 that pitted retail investors against Wall Street.\n\nHis reappearance signaled to retail investors that another meme rally was here and caused several stocks to rise by three-digit percentage points.\n\nBut these types of rallies tend not to be sustainable, which is why you might want to consider these meme stocks to sell while you still can.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) is the quintessential meme stock, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s the first on this list. But the primary reason I\u2019m including it as a meme stock to sell is that GameStop\u2019s fundamentals and longevity prospects have been shaky for years now.\n\nGME share price increase nearly sixfold from late April through the start of trading on May 14 before sinking over 20% by market close.\n\nIt shot up again over 20% after the video-game store chain announced it had cashed in $933 million from the meme stock surge this month.\n\nHowever, this meme rally alone will not fix GameStop\u2019s.\n\nGameStop\u2019s business model involves\u00a0 customers walking into its brick-and-mortar stores to buy video games, gaming merchandise and consumer electronics.\n\nThe problem is customers are increasingly going online for those types of solutions \u2014 something that has proven detrimental to the firm\u2019s survivability prospects. Unless it goes back to the drawing board, GameStop has serious headwinds ahead. It makes GME stock some of the meme stocks to sell at the moment.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Theatres (NYSE:AMC) has been hanging on by a thread for years now.\n\nBetween the lingering effects of Covid-19 \u2014 when moviegoers stayed home to Hollywood\u2019s recent labor strikes and increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to being billions in debt, the movie theater chain is barely keeping above water.\n\nIts occasional savior has been retail investors, who heavily bought its stock in 2021 and this month after Roaring Kitty\u2019s re-emergence on X.\n\nAnother shot in its arm was singers Taylor Swift and Beyonce\u2019s concert films \u2014 whose direct distribution deals with the company last year padded its bottom line for the time being.\n\nBut the company has a long way to go before it can become profitable again, and these random lifelines will not suffice to keep it afloat in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC stock\u2019s over 100% climb on Roaring Kitty\u2019s return this month cemented its status as a meme stock and is one you want to sell ASAP.\n\nBlackberry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo.

BB stock. meme stocks to sell\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackberry (NYSE:BB) stock rose this month in tandem with other meme stocks, but it is a meme stock to sell while you still can.\n\nThe BlackBerry company is another casualty of being caught being on the wrong side of a fast-changing business environment \u2014 just like GamesStop and AMC in their respective niches.\n\nBlackBerry was once a roaring success as a phone maker but was edged out of the market by Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS.\n\nIt has since rebranded itself as a cybersecurity and IoT software developer and had some success. For instance, for the 2024 fiscal year, it declared $853 million in revenue, with its IoT business reporting a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue jump.\n\nBut the same can\u2019t be said for its stock. Its share price has declined 48% YOY and 50% from the same time two years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s clear BlackBerry has some work to do to win back investor confidence.

        "content": "It\u2019s too bad for AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) bulls that investors can\u2019t live in a bubble. If they could, they would lock in the 45% gain for AMC stock over the past month.\n\nSadly, we don\u2019t live in a bubble, and AMC stock isn\u2019t a five-star investment. It\u2019s the exact opposite. It\u2019s a dud, but not because it is a movie theater chain; its shareholders refuse to read the tea leaves about the future.\n\nThis past Memorial Day weekend, the movie box office was abysmal, generating $128 million in ticket sales over the four days, 37% less than in 2023 and the lowest number since before the turn of the century.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFuriosa, the fifth installment of the Mad Max franchise, earned $32 million at the box office between Friday and Monday, the worst performance by a number-one film since Casper, released in 1995.\n\nThe holiday weekend\u2019s box office disaster is another reason AMC stock is radioactive. If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll stay away. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe Problem With the Movie Theater Business\n\nThree groups make the movie exhibition industry tick: operators like AMC, real estate owners such as EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR), and movie studios, independent filmmakers, and their distributors. While all three have positive aspects, they also have apparent negative aspects that can hurt your return on investment.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the studios and work backwards to AMC.\n\nIt costs a bundle to make movies. If it were easy to make money filmmaking, there would be a lot more filmmakers. According to the Indy Film Library, about 40% of studio releases in the U.S. make some profit, while less than a third of independent films do so.\n\nFor this reason, the studios supported by massive companies like Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) tend to favor big box office films like Star Wars, where the profits are large enough to make the big budgets worthwhile.\n\nReal estate owners like EPR own movie houses because lease revenues are generally stable, except during pandemics, and it\u2019s relatively easy to get funding to build these 10-20-screen complexes.\n\nThe downside is that real estate isn\u2019t very flexible. If movies aren\u2019t cutting it, what will you put in its place? Offices? That was sarcasm. Fitness Club? Maybe. Retail? Also, maybe. The list of maybes goes long.\n\nLastly, you have the movie exhibitors. They rely on real estate owners and film producers to keep the box office rolling. Without either of them, their businesses become far more hamstrung, unlikely to survive.\n\nIt would be better if movie theaters banded together into a cooperative to own and show movies where profit was an afterthought.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat isn\u2019t happening in the good old USA.\n\nMovie History Hurts AMC Stock\n\nImagine that I offered you the opportunity to open a restaurant in your hometown in the finest location within 50 miles. The only caveat is that the beverages you would buy to serve your customers would have to be my choosing. You would have no control over what is served. It could all be crappy, and you\u2019d be stuck with it.\n\nMost sane people would say, \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s what happens in the movie exhibition business.\n\nDespite having over 10,000 screens in the U.S. and overseas, AMC still operates under the thumb of the big movie studios and the distributors they work with to get films into theaters.\n\nThe name of the game for the studios is to make as much money as possible from the movies they produce. If Disney thinks the latest Star Wars film will do big box office, it might make 60% or more of the opening weekend box office and then less of a share as the weeks go by and the number of moviegoers falls.\n\nHowever, every film is different.\n\nUntil the 1948 Supreme Court decision in United States v. Paramount, which ruled that the vertical integration business model operated by Paramount and other big studios\u2014which included owning the movie theaters\u2014violated U.S. antitrust laws, the studios were forced to sell off their theaters.\n\nAt the end of the day, while the studios can\u2019t force AMC to show certain movies, it has to play ball if they want to get the best films available.\n\nThe problem is that when you\u2019ve got declining attendance \u2014 S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows that only 15% of Americans go to movies more than once a month, down from 23% in 2019 \u2014 it becomes even more critical for theaters to get box office winners.\n\nMore often than not, they\u2019re produced by the big studios. When they\u2019re duds like Furiosa, it makes it very difficult to make money.\n\nAMC stock remains a big sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Identifying stocks to sell has become a critical strategy for investors, as the economy shows no signs of the slowdown that the Fed is hoping for.\n\nThe Fed is expected to keep rates as they are due to ongoing inflation and indications of a resilient economy. Demonstrating this resilience, the industrial and services sectors have grown faster than expected, which might result in further stock market volatility.\n\nInvesting in reputable companies over an extended period of time can produce significant profits. However, investors should exercise prudence with a tough summer ahead, as even robust stocks can experience downturns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks that are overexposed to these economic headwinds might not just underperform but could substantially decrease in value. With that in mind, consider these three stocks to sell.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe massive meme stocks rally caused several stocks to see major price surges recently. Amidst this, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) got the short-squeeze treatment too. However, the rise from this short squeeze seems destined to fade quickly. Even with these occasional bumps, AMC stock has plummeted, losing 89%\u00a0of its value in the past one year.\n\nMoreover, AMC\u2019s revenue in the first quarter of 2024 dropped to $951.4 million, a $3 million decrease annually. Furthermore, the company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA plunged to a deeper loss of $31.6 million, marking a 545% decline from the previous year.\n\nOn top of that, AMC faced a net earnings loss of $163.5 million, coupled with an alarming long-term debt burden of around $4.5 billion. If its revenue does not improve, servicing this debt could become a huge problem in the future.\n\nNotably, a recent Bloomberg report underscores the ongoing struggle, as movie ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada continue to lag behind pre-pandemic levels, hindering any potential recovery for theater chains. Considering this, the financial outlook just doesn\u2019t look good for AMC.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo is over an orange background with a little shopping cart with packages in it. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the e-commerce trend isn\u2019t fading away, let\u2019s shift our focus to Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY). This e-commerce platform for handmade goods reached its zenith during Covid-19, much like its industry peers. Yet, it has been difficult to regain investor confidence with a post-pandemic slowdown in demand. Additionally, it\u2019s struggling to sustain last year\u2019s financials, as evident by the 24% decline in shares this year and a daunting 63% dip over the previous three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest blow came with Etsy\u2019s Q1 2024 results, which offered no encouragement. Consolidated gross merchandise sales plummeted by 3.7% year-over-year (YOY). The continued declines in GMS forced Etsy to raise its fees if it wants to boost revenue and profits. However, those same fee hikes could prevent users from engaging with its platform.\n\nFurthermore, Etsy\u2019s valuation appears to be higher than its predicted growth. The company is trading at about 28x forward GAAP earnings, but its expected top-line growth is barely 6% per annum.\n\nLucid Motors (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nThe electric vehicle sector has faced multiple roadblocks, leading traders to reassess their stakes in riskier stocks. Among these stocks to sell, Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) is at the forefront. Its stock price has nosedived by a staggering 63% over the past year, indicating a sharp downturn in its prospects.\n\nAdding to Lucid\u2019s woes, the 2023 financial results are dire, with the company facing operating losses exceeding $3 billion. Concurrently, it incurred losses exceeding $100,000 per car on a gross-margin basis.\n\nTransitioning to Q1 2024, Lucid\u2019s revenue missed projections by $9.74 million and its earnings-per-share (EPS) lagged behind estimates by five cents. Additionally, Lucid has grappled with a significant cash burn, losing around $715 million in this quarter alone. Its financial hardship needs regular cash infusions to keep operations running.\n\nAmid these struggles, Lucid lowered its previous prediction of 90,000 EVs by 2024 to just 9,000 this year, raising severe doubts about its ability to meet demand.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Roll Credits on AMC: Buy These 7 Entertainment Stocks Instead",
        "content": "As this month\u2019s Roaring Kitty meme wave has now come and gone, it\u2019s time to skip on names like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), and look at far better entertainment stocks to buy for growth and value.\n\nEven as AMC stock has coughed back most of its gains from this short-lived meme rallies, shares in the movie theater chain remain at risk of experiencing additional sharp price declines. Mostly, because of the company\u2019s continued aggressive use of dilutive financing methods, such as debt-for-equity swaps, as well as the sale of newly issued shares.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for entertainment stocks to buy , there are a multitude of much stronger opportunities out there, one of which is a direct AMC competitor. Whereas AMC is overvalued and overhyped, many of these alternative choices are undervalued, and could prove their skeptics wrong in a big way.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s dive in and take a look at seven entertainment stocks to buy instead of AMC.\n\nAMC Networks (AMCX) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for AMC Networks (AMCX).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Networks (NYSE:AMCX) may have a similar-sounding name as AMC Entertainment, but the two companies are not related. Shares in this operator of cable television and streaming networks also differ from AMC in other ways.\n\nWhile AMC stock is overvalued and overhyped, AMCX stock is undervalued and underestimated. Short-sellers have aggressively bet against AMC, on the view that cord-cutting and the pivot to streaming will be detrimental to its business. Still, much like I argued late last year, these negatives are more-than baked into its valuation.\n\nShares today trade for only 3.1 times forward earnings. Although AMCX\u2019s latest results suggest more disappointment ahead, with so much uncertainty baked into its valuation, it may take just a modicum of positive news to send this stock significantly higher. This alone makes AMCX a much better buy than AMC.\n\nCinemark Holdings (CNK) Cinemark movie theatre location in the Louis Joliet Mall in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nSource: LukeandKarla.Travel / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou may justify holding AMC, on the view that the company will benefit from a further post-COVID rebound in movie theater attendance.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re looking to make such a wager, Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) is one of the better entertainment stocks to buy.\n\nThe reasons for this go beyond just the fact that CNK stock, at 15 times forward earnings, is far more attractive than AMC in terms of valuation. As Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey argued last month, Cinemark stands to benefit from having a stronger balance sheet than its peers, as well from a further contraction in total movie screens nationwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nHickey also expects a significant increase in box office receipts starting next year. The analyst is not alone in this assessment, based on 2025 forecasts. Consensus calls for revenue to rise 13.1% in 2025, with earnings soaring 47%, from $1.19 to $1.75 per share.\n\nFox (FOX) Fox News Channel at the News Corporation headquarters building in New York City. News Corporation is an American diversified multinational mass media corporation\n\nSource: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nFox (NYSE:FOX) continues to be somewhat of a value trap among entertainment stocks. FOX is seen as a declining \u201cold media\u201d play, which benefits you if you haven\u2019t invested yet.\n\nThe Fox News Channel and Fox Sports parent continues to increase its streaming exposure, such as through the further expansion of its Tubi advertising-supported streaming platform.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Alongside the Tubi catalyst, BofA\u2019s Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted other potential catalysts, in her recent upgrade of FOX stock.\n\nEhrlich noted that Fox\u2019s linear media assets could be more resilient, due to their greater amount of live content like sports or news. She also mentioned the potential with Fox\u2019s \u201chidden asset\u201d: its option to buy a stake in online sportsbook FanDuel, as well as its stake in FanDuel\u2019s parent, Flutter Entertainment (NYSE:FLUT).\n\nLions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A,LGF.B) A Lions Gate (LGF.A, LGF.B) sign in front of the company headquarters in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.com\n\nLions Gate Entertainment (NYSE:LGF-A,NYSE:LGF-B) is a media holding company that owns premium cable and streaming company Starz, as well as an 87.3% stake in Lionsgate Studios (NASDAQ:LION).\n\nLGF used to own both outright, but this year it split off its eponymous film studio assets, through a special purpose acquisition company merger.\n\nIn time, this split off could help realize significant value for LGF-A stock investors. With a market cap of $2.06 billion, LGF-A trades at a discount to the value of its LION stake, which means you get the Starz media assets for free.\n\nAlso, as noted in an investor presentation, content-rich media companies have been sold in recent years at very higher valuations.\n\nHence, Lionsgate Studios could be worth far more to a strategic buyer. Chock full of deep value, consider Lions Gate Entertainment one of the entertainment stocks to buy instead of AMC.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike I have discussed previously, Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is \u201cin play,\u201d with several strategic and financial acquirers reportedly interested in taking buying all or some parts of the media conglomerate.\n\nSony (NYSE:SONY) and Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) have been the latest bidders for the company. Although there have been concerns they were about to back out of making a bid, recent developments suggest it is still possible.\n\nBut while a possible takeover is currently the strongest catalyst for PARA stock, it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s the only catalyst at hand.\n\nAs Seeking Alpha commentator Max Greve recently argued, sentiment for PARA has been clouded by last year\u2019s reporting of one-time losses. Also, he argued that as Paramount is moving away from overspending on streaming content, its operating performance could improve dramatically. Improved results could, in turn, spark an additional rally.\n\nSinclair (SBGI) n this photo illustration the Sinclair Broadcast Group (SGBI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for deep value, Sinclair (NASDAQ:SBGI) is one of the best entertainment stocks to buy. Sure, there is a very good reason why shares in this broadcast television station operator trade at rock-bottom prices.\n\nSBGI trades for only 4.1 times forward earnings, and has a 8.12% forward dividend yield.\n\nSinclair is highly exposed to the decline of linear media. It also has a heavily-leveraged balance sheet to boot. Yet while SBGI stock is hardly a problem-free situation, there is the potential for big rewards, if you choose to go contrarian, and buy this stock.\n\nWhy? For one, further news regarding a possible sale of nearly a third of Sinclair\u2019s stations is something that may drive another outsized move for the stock. Also, as InvestorPlace Earnings reported earlier this month, EPS came in better-than-feared last quarter. Similar positive surprises may lie ahead.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nYes, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has been a value trap since the Reverse Morris Trust transaction that created it closed in 2022. At that time WBD stock traded for around $25 per share.\n\nToday, shares change hands at around $7.75 per share. Still, it\u2019s possible shares have finally hit a bottom. At least, based on the bull case laid out by one analyst team. Earlier this month, analysts at KeyBanc who upgraded WBD to \u201coverweight,\u201d with an $11 per share price target.\n\nIn its upgrade, KeyBanc cited several catalysts, including the prospect of WBD\u2019s streaming segment to become profitable next year.\n\nGiven some of the more negative takeaways from the company\u2019s latest earnings release, this may not be the best opportunity out there among entertainment stocks. However, WBD is definitely a much more compelling buy than AMC.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Meme stocks are back in the big leagues, spurred by the return of Keith Gill, known as \u2018Roaring Kitty.\u2019 Many of the original meme stock plays, like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC), which went parabolic in 2021, soared over 70%. Many would feel that renewed interest in meme stocks\u00a0to buy\u00a0echoes the 2021 frenzy when retail traders effectively reshaped markets.\n\nTo be fair, the current meme stock rally which started on Monday, has mostly fizzled out. Thus, equating the sustained impact of the original meme stock rally with the current surge misses the mark. However, the renewed enthusiasm in stocks with a strong online backing points to lucrative opportunities for savvy investors.\n\nIn this article, though, we\u2019ll be taking a different approach. The spotlight is on meme stocks to buy with real substance, drawing massive attention to Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) via the ApeWisdom tool.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech juggernaut\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominated headlines leading up to its first-quarter (Q1) earnings print and didn\u2019t disappoint.\u00a0It delivered an eye-watering revenue of $26 billion, a 262.2% year-over-year (YOY) increase, beating estimates by $1.45 billion. Data center sales, in particular, surged 427% YOY and roughly 23% sequentially. Moreover, its non-GAAP EPS of $6.12 blew past estimates by 54 cents. Looking ahead, the firm expects to generate $28 billion in sales during the second-quarter (Q2), a 101% increase from the prior-year period.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, though, as the AI chip giant announced a massive 150% quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share.\u00a0Additionally, it announced a ten-for-one forward stock split, which would have NVDA stock trading at around $95 at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Nvidia\u2019s Q1 results provided plenty to unpack over its dominance in the AI chip market. It commands roughly 80% of the market, and its peers are merely contending for what remains. Moreover, with it expected to dish out new products like the Blackwell GPU, it would be rather foolish to bet against the stock.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is a big-name retailer trading at a deep discount. LULU stock is trading roughly 42% behind its 52-week highs, buffeted by economic challenges dampening its domestic sales. Consequently, the stock trades around 4.25 times forward sales estimates, 45% higher than its 5-year average.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe athletic apparel and sneaker producer has witnessed a marked slowdown in U.S. sales, resulting in a lackluster full-year top-and-bottom-line projection. Moreover, it disclosed plans to close its Washington state distribution center while cutting 100 jobs. Despite its challenges, investors have gotten too spooked by its current woes.\n\nOn the bright side,\u00a0it beat estimates on both lines for the eighth-consecutive quarter, including its latest earnings print. Additionally, international sales jumped by 54% YOY, with sales in China alone climbing to 78%. Turning to analyst projections, Wall-Street analysts assign a \u2018moderate buy\u2019 rating to the stock, with more than a 54% upside from current prices.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) Robinhood's mobile app logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. Robinhood stocks. HOOD stock\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of social trading platform\u00a0Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) have been on fire over the past year. HOOD stock surged more than 124% last year and an even better 139% in the past six months. A vibrant crypto rally and favorable stock market dynamics have propelled HOOD stock to multi-year highs. Moreover, given the likelihood of interest rate cuts later this year, expect more upside for HOOD stock.\n\nFurthermore, Robinhood is far from being just a one-trick pony. Though much of its success is linked to its strength in crypto markets, its expansion into other fintech verticals makes it a more comprehensive financial services provider. More specifically, it\u2019s looking to venture into retirement accounts, expand its trading options, and recently launched a Gold credit card. The card has attracted more than a million waitlist sign-ups, with a 42% YOY increase in subscribers.\n\nMoreover, following another blowout quarterly result, Bank of America Securities analyst Craig Siegenthaler upgraded HOOD stock to a \u2018buy\u2019 from \u2018underperform.\u2019 The notable double-upgrade was driven by heightened retail engagement, enhanced organic growth, and the platform\u2019s positive operational leverage following sizable cost reductions. It is one of the best meme stocks to buy, in my opinion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "These 3 Stocks Just Hit a 52-Week High. Load Up or Cash Out?",
        "content": "There should be nothing special about stocks at a 52-week high. Obviously the milestone indicates business has been good and likely will be better in the future. The market is signaling confidence the stock will continue to outperform. And studies suggest that thinking may be right.\n\nOne said \u201cthat nearness to the 52-week high is a better predictor of future returns than are past returns.\u201d It discovered that stocks trading at or very near their peak end up continuing on their way as the good news that propelled them higher is proven true. The same is true in reverse. Stocks at or near their lows also continue falling.\n\nYet it is not universal. Movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was recently very close to its 52-week low and suddenly spiked 78% higher because Reddit star Roaring Kitty posted a meme on X (formerly Twitter). It had nothing to do with the theater chain or its business. It was just overexuberant traders piling into a meme stock. Of course, AMC has since collapsed again, losing a third of its value in just a week, but it remains almost 2x above where it was trading before the meme post.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks can also fall from their highs after hitting a high note. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) was at a 52-week high before earnings and it is now 27% below those levels on fears of slowing growth.\n\nThe three companies below are stocks at a 52-week high. Will they be like most that continue on their upward trajectory or will they crash and burn? Let\u2019s look closer at each to find out.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nUtilities are not considered artificial intelligence (AI) stocks but that may soon change. The growth of data centers and the role AI plays in their proliferation positions the industry for tremendous future gains. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) could be one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nBecause AI is an energy hog, demand for more and cheaper energy solutions will rise. That favors utilities in the southeast where electricity costs are lower than in much of the rest of the country. And those utilities investing heavily in renewable sources should edge out the competition. That\u2019s why Florida-based NextEra is a uniquely formidable competitor.\n\nNextEra has invested over $206 billion into its regulated and renewable energy projects since 2001. It is the world\u2019s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a top-tier stock in battery storage. Of the approximate 65 gigawatts (GW) of energy capacity in its portfolio, 36 GW are from renewable sources. And it keeps adding to it each quarter. It currently has about 3.5 GW of data center capacity and another nearly 3.5 GW in its backlog. It also has a pipeline of 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage in various stages of development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith NextEra Energy stock at a 52-week high, there\u2019s no reason it won\u2019t power higher in the future.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother AI stock that comes out of left field is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). While the movie streamer\u2019s ability to raise prices and operate at a global scale make it the \u201cgold standard\u201d in the industry (that\u2019s what Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger called it), Wall Street thinks AI is what truly sets it apart. Or will.\n\nBecause Netflix is a tech-centric business, Needham analysts say AI will heavily influence its ability to create and collate content though it is already present in how it recommends content to viewers. Netflix says it also uses machine learning to drive content demand modeling and delivery caching.\n\nYet Netflix stock at a 52-week high is a result not so much of AI technology but its ability to outperform expectations. Last quarter it brought on 9.3 million new subscribers, far surpassing the 5.2 million analysts expected.\n\nWall Street now sees Netflix breaking through the $700 per share threshold (boy, did I ever get that wrong!). Trading at around $645 per share, it is already within striking distance. And with analysts forecasting 28% long-term annual growth in earnings its current high-point could soon seem quaint.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt least I got MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) right. One of the first stock picks I made last year for InvestorPlace was the leading Latin American e-commerce and fintech stock. It is witnessing superlative growth in sales and volume and MercadoLibre stock is up 10% in 2024. It stands 30% higher over the past year.\n\nThe company\u2019s e-commerce platform saw gross merchandise volume (GMV) surge 20% in the first quarter to $11.3 billion while its MercadoPago fintech solution enjoyed 35% growth in total payment volume (TPV) to $40.7 billion. The number of monthly active users of the fintech platform also soared 36% higher to 49 million.\n\nMy call on the stock was a bet on the growth of emerging market economies. Brazil and Mexico are MercadoLibre\u2019s two largest markets. GMV grew 30% year-over-year in each while assets under management on the fintech side more than doubled in each country.\n\nWith Wall Street forecasting 35% long-term growth in earnings and the stock trading at less than twice that rate, MercadoLibre stock could be hitting new 52-week highs for some time to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It is the unofficial kickoff to summer this weekend. Millions of Americans are expected to hit the road and fly the skies to enjoy warmer weather and get a break from the grind. We've seen just how popular many forms of in-person entertainment have been in the past year, so there's reason for optimism on the consumption front.\n\nRecall that about a year ago, the \"Taylor Swift Effect\" drove improved economic growth in certain regions (no joke, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said as much), and strong ratings and ticket sales have been seen for other artists and in live sports.[1] It doesn't hurt that, as of this writing, a pair of New York professional sports teams are making playoff runs too.\n\nBut not all entertainment venues have been welcoming boisterous crowds. So far in 2024, domestic gross box office sales are down 24% from year-ago levels through May 15, according to IMDbPro.[2] It comes as Hollywood struggles to put out popular blockbusters and as continued drama in the media-enterprise space casts a dark cloud over out-of-the-house entertainment.\n\nWeaker box office sales in 2024 Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024\n\nSource: Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro\n\nBundle-unbundle-rebundle\n\nInvestors and casual observers alike have surely read and heard about the ongoing drama at Disney (NYSE:DIS). All the while, families across the country have been forced to consider the steeply rising costs of subscription streaming services. Maybe just as frustrating for consumers, it seems the movies and entertainment industry is now pivoting from an a la carte sales model back to bundling, which has features of the old-school cable package.\n\nCorporate activity\n\nThere has been no break in the action this year with so many moving pieces and a reshuffling of the media playing field. It was just a handful of months ago when Lionsgate Studio spun off from Starz. The new entity, Lionsgate Studios Corp. (LFG.A), focuses on film and TV. Then in May, shares of Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) fell on a report that Sony was rethinking its $26 billion bid for the company.[3] The latest whisper is that Paramount and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may partner up.[4]\n\nNetflix pounces on new opportunities\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, continues to venture further into sports, inking a three-year deal with the NFL to stream a set of games each season.[5] It also plans to launch an in-house advertising technology platform to further diversify its revenue sources.[6] The Communication Services stalwart may not be grouped with the Magnificent Seven heavyweights, but shares are up more than 25% in 2024.[7] Boasting a highly profitable ad-supported tier, with a total subscriber base of 40 million customers, up five million from a year ago, consumers just keep chillin'.[8]\n\nStory continues\n\n2021 social media favorites come roaring back\n\nAnd how can we not offer a nod to meme-stock mania Part III? Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC) have gone bananas in recent weeks, all prompted by a single picture posted to X by @TheRoaringKitty earlier this month.[9] Of course, the social-trading frenzy has little to do with fundamentals in the movie market, but the saga is worthy of sitting back with a bowl of popcorn and seeing what unfolds.\n\nFeature films\n\nBut let's aim the spotlight at the movie scene as the summer months inch closer. Our data show that, as has become the norm, Netflix dominates the movie-release count from mid-May through the Labor Day weekend. Nineteen major motion pictures are slated to be released. Sony Pictures Studios is runner-up with 13 movies set to hit the domestic box office. Disney and Lionsgate also have several high-profile films in the cue.\n\nMajor movie release count through Labor Day weekend Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nConferences and shareholder meetings on tap\n\nOn the event watch, following the JP Morgan 52nd Annual TMT Global Technology Media and Communications Conference this week, be on the lookout for potential volatility in the media space on May 30 when the Bernstein 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference (SDC) begins. Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), Paramount Global, AMC and Netflix each hold annual shareholder meetings during the first full week of June. All eyes will then be on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when it holds its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\n\nGrab your popcorn What to watch this summer\n\nAs for the box office, much depends on how the summer lineup performs. Here are the key motion pictures that analysts will watch closely and movie-goers can look forward to:\n\nMay 24: The Garfield Movie, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, AtlasJune 7: The CrowJune 14: Inside Out 2, Bad Boys 4June 21: The BikeridersJune 28: A Quiet Place: Day One, Horizon: An American Saga (Chapter 1)July 3: Despicable Me 4July 5: MaXXXineJuly 12: LonglegsJuly 19: TwistersJuly 26: Deadpool & WolverineAugust 9: BorderlandsAugust 16: Horizon: An American Saga (Chapter 2), Alien: RomulusAugust 30: Kraven the HunterSeptember 6: Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThere's been more drama and action scenes in movie stocks than on the big screen so far in 2024. The media space continues to go through shakeups both in the boardroom and with broad strategies. All the while, consumers may be growing increasingly frustrated with TV options, but data suggests fewer folks are flocking to theaters for entertainment. All eyes will now be on Hollywood's summer lineup.\n\n1 Summary of Economic Activity, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, June 2023, https://www.philadelphiafed.org2 Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro, May 22, 2024, https://www.boxofficemojo.com/3 Paramount shares fall after CNBC reports Sony rethinking its bid, Reuters, May 14, 2024, https://www.reuters.com4 Paramount Holds Talks With Amazon About Expanded Partnership, Bloomberg, Thomas Buckley, Lucas Shaw, May 15, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com5 Netflix Nears Deal for NFL Games, Extending Push Into Sports, Bloomberg, Lucas Shaw, Randall Williams, May 15, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com6 Netflix To Launch In-House Advertising Tech Platform, Next TV, Jon Lafayette, May 15, 2024, https://www.nexttv.com7 NFLX, Stockcharts, May 17, 2024, http://stockcharts.com8 Netflix hits 40 million users for ad-supported plan, Reuters, May 16, 2024, https://www.reuters.com9 TheRoaringKitty, X, May 12, 2024, https://x.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "title": "Rejected by Robots: AI Thinks You Should Sell These 7 Meme Stocks Now",
        "content": "In this article, we delve into the world of meme stocks and explore the insights provided by cutting-edge AI algorithms. These advanced systems have analyzed market trends, and company fundamentals, to identify seven meme stocks to sell according to AI.\n\nAs we examine each of these seven meme stocks, we will discuss the factors that led the AI to its conclusions, providing a look at the potential risks and drawbacks associated with these investments.\n\nIt should be noted that these conclusions should be taken with a large pinch of salt, as the direction of meme stocks are often influenced by investor psychology that AI can\u2019t fully contextualize or process fully.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, it might be worth looking into these meme stocks to sell according to AI to get an objective perspective that\u2019s not influenced by the emotions of greed and fear. For this article, I\u2019ve used both the newest models of ChatGPT and Claude to find and process analysis of these meme stocks.\r\n\r\nSo here are seven meme stocks to sell according to AI.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was identified as one of those meme stocks to sell. ChatGPT said: \u201cAMC has struggled significantly post-pandemic, with a dramatic decrease in share value due to declining theater attendance and significant debt. Despite attempts to revitalize with new movie releases, the company continues to face financial challenges and high shareholder dilution.\u201d\n\nChatGPT also stated that: \u201cAMC is consistently unprofitable, carrying a significant amount of debt, which has raised concerns about its long-term viability. The company has been described as \u201ca dead company walking\u201d due to its heavy debt load and ongoing financial losses. Despite efforts to raise capital through stock sales, the dilution of shares has negatively impacted shareholder value. AMC\u2019s shares outstanding have increased dramatically from 12 million in January 2020 to over 250 million today\u200b.\u201d\n\nThis could be a valid point since the brand\u2019s shares outstanding have swelled over 91% year-over-year, and it is also struggling with liquidity issues thanks to its\u00a0$8.99 billion in debt.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA stock) logo on white object in foreground as well as a high-rise building in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarvana (NYSE:CVNA) was another meme stock that AI thinks that investors should sell. It said: \u201cCarvana experienced a massive short squeeze in 2023 but remains heavily shorted due to concerns about its high valuation and leveraged balance sheet. The online used car retailer\u2019s fundamentals do not support its current stock price, making it a risky investment.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also noted that: \u201cDespite recent improvements, Carvana is still projected to experience net losses in 2024 and 2025. This ongoing financial strain raises questions about the company\u2019s ability to achieve profitability. The sell-side forecasts do not support a near-term turnaround, adding credence to the bearish outlook.\u201d\n\nLike with AMC, CVNA\u2019s shares outstanding also grew at what I consider an unsustainably fast rate, climbing over 100% year-over-year at the time of writing. This somewhat blunts its share price rally over the same period of 135.38%, which is a grave warning sign.\n\nDigital World Acquisition (DWAC) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital World Acquisition (NASDAQ:DWAC) is the next on the chopping block, according to AI. It said: \u201cDWAC, the SPAC aiming to merge with Trump Media& Technology Group, has seen stock volatility linked to political events. However, the stock faces challenges with regulatory delays and uncertain business prospects, making it vulnerable to significant declines\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are considerable uncertainties about TMTG\u2019s business prospects. Despite the speculative interest driven by Trump\u2019s media presence, the actual performance and profitability of TMTG\u2019s platforms like Truth Social remain questionable. Investors are concerned about the platform\u2019s ability to compete with established social media giants and generate sustainable revenue,\u201d Claude continued.\n\nDWAC could be the ultimate vehicle for betting for (or against) Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, and I envision that it will note record volatility in the weeks and months leading up to the election.\n\nIts value then is tied to an event not explicitly tied to its main operating segments, which gives it a more speculative layer that other meme stocks lack, without a proportionate upside.\n\nHut 8 (HUT) In this photo illustration the Hut 8 Mining logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHut 8 (NASDAQ:HUT) is a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company that has found itself on AI\u2019s radar as one of those meme stocks to sell. It said \u201cHut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, has faced scrutiny and allegations from short-sellers. With the recent decline in cryptocurrency prices and ongoing controversies, Hut 8\u2019s stock faces substantial downside risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHut 8 recently reported disappointing financial results for the first quarter of 2024, missing both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue estimates. The company posted an EPS of -17 cents, significantly below analyst expectations of 59 cents, and reported revenue of $51.74 million, which was 20.48% lower than the projected $65.07 million\u200b\u200b. This poor financial performance highlights ongoing challenges in achieving profitability.\u201d\n\nDespite these short-term weaknesses, my view is that the Bitcoin miners that will still be around in a decade from now will be those who can leverage scale effectively to reduce costs. Smaller miners like HUT are focusing on improving efficiency, which puts it at odds with this thesis.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s block rewards continue to halve, and input costs rise, miners are making a large bet that Bitcoin will continue to appreciate in value in order for their efforts to be worth it, along with increased efficiency of their mining rigs. Smaller firms may not be able to comfortably shoulder these risks as the centralization of the hash rate continues.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome players in the space industry are also not to AI\u2019s liking, with Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) being noted as one of those meme stocks to sell.\n\n\u201cVirgin Galactic\u2019s commercial space flights have generated minimal revenue, and the company is rapidly burning through its cash reserves. With low revenue generation and high cash burn, the company may run out of funds, posing a high risk for investors.\u201d\n\nIt also notes that \u201cIn a strategic shift, Virgin Galactic plans to halt flights of its current suborbital vehicle, VSS Unity, by mid-2024 to focus resources on developing its next-generation Delta-class vehicles. This decision will reduce the frequency of flights, further limiting revenue in the short term. The company aims to redirect resources to ensure the Delta-class vehicles are operational by 2026, but this pivot involves substantial execution risk\u201d.\n\nSPCE has taken a hit ever since its main insider, Richard Branson, said he would no longer invest money into the company, stating that it \u201cshould have sufficient funds to do its job on its own,\u201d citing its $1 billion balance sheet at the time he made that statement.\n\nThis may be seen as a prudent risk management strategy or a cause for alarm, but in either case it may reinforce the bear case to sell it as a meme stock.\n\nMullen Automotive (MULN) Mullen Automotive offers superior, technologically advanced electric vehicles. Their premium quality EVs pioneer a sustainable, eco-friendly future. MULN stock\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) is one of those contentious meme stocks and AI has caught wind of this. It said \u201cMullen Automotive reported significant losses and low revenue from its electric vehicle sales. The company\u2019s financials are weak, with substantial cash burn and limited orders, making it a risky investment in the highly competitive EV market\u201d.\n\n\u201cRecent partnerships and joint ventures announced by Mullen, such as with Global EV Technology and EV Technologies, have not significantly improved investor confidence. The lack of detailed financial information regarding these ventures adds to the uncertainty about their potential positive impact on Mullen\u2019s business\u201d.\r\n\r\nSomething that AI missed is that MULN\u2019s shares outstanding increased 7,358.46% year-over-year, which would have diluted the ownership of existing investors to almost nothing. Recovering from that loss would require an astronomical return.\n\nIf this share dilution continues, there may be no point in investing in MULN, despite the promises of high capital gains.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding cellphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), another contentious pick, is the last meme stock that AI has identified outright as a company to sell.\n\n\u201cPlug Power, involved in hydrogen energy, has seen fluctuating stock prices due to market downturns and weak financial results. Concerns about its ability to finance future projects and continued shareholder dilution pose risks to its stock value.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite having cash and cash equivalents totaling $172.9 million, Plug Power\u2019s ongoing operations and investments result in significant cash outflows. This high cash burn rate necessitates continuous capital raising, which could dilute shareholder value\u200b\u201d.\n\nPLUG is certainly a polarizing name in the hydrogen industry. It has recently shook off fears that it will ot remain a going concern, but its high rate of cash burn remains an issue in a speculative industry.\n\nThe meme stock is more risky than many of the names listed here, as it is flirting with bankruptcy more closely, and thus should be invested in only by those with an extreme risk tolerance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Copper Prices Are Shooting for the Moon. Ignore the Noise About Meme Stocks.",
        "content": "While everyone is talking about AMC (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME), the real story is copper. And if you haven\u2019t noticed, copper prices are currently shooting for the moon.\n\nCopper \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/kWahylTpPH\n\n\u2014 Michael A. Gayed, CFA (@leadlagreport) May 17, 2024\n\nOne of the biggest investment themes I have been following is the potential for China\u2019s economy to start showing signs of life. It\u2019s happening. Those markets have been on a tear, and the Chinese government is finally starting to take action.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter a prolonged bear market in the country\u2019s property sector, China is now taking some decisive steps to stabilize prices. Whether or not it will be successful is unclear, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\n\nI think the move in copper is partially based on that. As the largest importer of copper, China\u2019s economic policies and initiatives, such as the issuance of 1 trillion yuan in ultra-long bonds for infrastructure, have a substantial impact on copper prices and demand. Projections indicate that annual global copper demand will rise to 36.6 million metric tons by 2031, up from 25.3 million in 2021, with China playing a pivotal role in this increase due to its strategic investments and consumption patterns. A resurgent China means resurgent copper.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than China. It\u2019s also AI.\n\nAI and China Are Taking Copper Prices Higher\n\nThe rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence has significantly increased the demand for copper, primarily due to its extensive use in data centers. These data centers, essential for cloud computing, big data processing, and AI algorithms, require substantial amounts of copper for electrical wiring and infrastructure. Bank of America notes that the growing need for AI capabilities has shifted focus toward copper usage in data center buildouts, which has contributed to the recent rise in copper prices. This surge in demand for copper in AI data centers is a key factor driving the overall increase in global copper consumption. And that won\u2019t go away any time soon.\n\nWhat about new supply? Good luck. Mining new copper and bringing it to market is a complex and challenging process due to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the depletion of high-grade copper ores has necessitated mining lower-grade deposits, which are more costly and less efficient to extract. Additionally, environmental regulations and community opposition often delay or halt new mining projects. The capital-intensive nature of developing new mines, which can take over a decade from discovery to production, further complicates the process. Lastly, geopolitical risks and fluctuating market prices add layers of uncertainty, making the availability of new copper to the market a formidable challenge.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rally in copper prices looks real, as does the demand. The supply constraints are also real, however. And it could get really interesting really soon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Gayed did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Cathie Wood Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest funds were unstoppable in 2020 as investors piled into disruptive innovation stocks during the low-rate lockdown environment. After peaking in early 2021, the ARK funds \u2014 most notably the ARK Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) \u2014 went on a multi-year decline, eventually bottoming out at the tail end of 2022.\n\nToday, the technology sector bull market is alive and well, thanks in part to the generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) rush and hopes for future Fed rate cuts. Despite tech\u2019s momentum, ARKK has seen relatively muted performance, now up just 12% in the past year and actually down 10% year to date.\n\nOnly time will tell if the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d theme will play catch up with the rest of the sector once the Fed readies to cut rates. Either way, Cathie Wood stocks seem worth checking in on here should the tech rally begin to reward some riskier, disruptive innovators who aren\u2019t yet making a profit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWho knows? Perhaps a few rate cuts could be enough to help Cathie Wood\u2019s disruptive-focused thematic investment style make a comeback. Here are three of my favorite Cathie Wood stocks to buy.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NASDAQ:PATH) is an automation software developer that aims to tackle repetitive everyday tasks in the workplace. Now that shares have come back to Earth, UiPath is arguably one of the most intriguing gen AI plays in the entire ARKK.\n\nAt writing, PATH stock is down around 75% from its 2021 peak, which may make it an intriguing value proposition for hyper-growth investors seeking underrated AI upside but not mind the firm\u2019s lack of profits.\n\nToday, PATH stock goes for 8.8 times price-to-sales (P/S), which isn\u2019t all too high given the magnitude of growth behind its automation platform. As UiPath improves its automation capabilities with gen AI while rates potentially take a few backward steps, I certainly wouldn\u2019t bet against the firm.\n\nThe company\u2019s expanded partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud is also a compelling development that investors should monitor.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Roaring Kitty coming out of hibernation after around three years with posts on X (formerly Twitter), it should come as no surprise to see the action in the 2021-era meme stocks picking up once again. Indeed, the \u201cbig money\u201d meme stock short-sellers who didn\u2019t learn their lesson in 2021 have been feeling the squeeze once again.\n\nThe initial boom in shares of Gamestop (NYSE:GME) and AMCEntertainment (NYSE:AMC) have since gone bust in a big way, less than a week since Roaring Kitty\u2019s return. Still, it\u2019s a terrible idea to short either GME or AMC stock as they reverse course. Both meme stocks could easily rocket or implode tomorrow, potentially by high double-digit percentage points. Either way, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is enjoying the pick-up in trading activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the meme stock frenzy and soaring stock market win the love of the retail crowd again, Robinhood stands to gain. Recently, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Craig Siegenthaler double-upgraded HOOD stock, citing \u201cthe emergence of a new bull market\u201d and \u201crebounding retail engagement benefits.\u201d He\u2019s right. Roaring Kitty\u2019s return could certainly amplify the latter catalyst.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology innovator Cathie Wood has steadily added to in recent years. Undoubtedly, many investors have been throwing in the towel on MRNA stock as COVID-19 vaccine sales dwindled.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s contrarian buy of the vaccine maker is intriguing, especially as the company continues advancing many promising potentials through trials. Despite the recent FDA delay in its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, I still view Moderna as still one of the most innovative companies in the biotech scene. However, it could take a few more quarters for most other investors to get truly excited about the growth potential of next-generation mRNA treatments.\n\nWith the stock gaining more than 100% from its November 2023 lows, perhaps it\u2019s time that growth investors had followed Wood\u2019s lead. For growth-hungry investors like Wood, willing to ride out the volatility while focusing on the long-term narrative, it makes sense to pursue Moderna now that it\u2019s gaining traction again. Perhaps the RSV vaccine could be the next big thing to be excited about.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "title": "GameStop Stock Analysis: Let\u2019s Not Do 2021 Again, Please",
        "content": "Video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), along with global movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and a handful of other companies, are the talk of Wall Street again. It feels like 2021 all over again, but that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing for sensible investors.\u00a0After delving into\u00a0the company\u2019s financial facts, you\u2019ll hopefully be convinced to stay away from GameStop stock.\n\nIf you\u2019re a day trader who flips GameStop\u00a0shares for a quick buck, that\u2019s a different story entirely. My message is for serious, sensible investors. Seeking multibagger gains with meme stocks is a dangerous pursuit, and getting caught up in the GameStop hype could cost you a lot of your hard-earned money.\n\nWhat Goes Up Too Fast, Must Come Down\n\nIn case you missed it, GameStop stock catapulted from $18 to $64 in a few days during the middle of May. This occurred after meme-stock celebrity \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d resurfaced on social media for the first time in several years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt\u2019s basically a replay of what took place in 2021 during the height of the meme-stock frenzy. Back then, investors who held on to their GameStop shares for too long were punished in 2022, 2023 and early 2024.\n\nIn other words, you had to have great luck and timing to profit from that trade. The same thing could be said about this year\u2019s meme-stock cycle. It\u2019s following the 2021 playbook, as GameStop stock quickly dropped in the second half of May after rallying during the first half of the month.\n\nI\u2019d like to echo the wary sentiment of financial analyst and YouTuber Kevin Paffrath. He warned that buying meme stocks is \u201csort of like playing the lottery.\u201d I agree, except I would replace \u201csort of\u201d with \u201ccompletely.\u201d\n\nA Reality Check for GameStop Investors\n\nThe post-rally drop in GameStop stock picked up speed on May 17, and there was a specific reason for this. On that morning, GameStop released its preliminary results for the first fiscal quarter, which ended on May 4, 2024.\n\nThere were a couple of major pain points in the preliminary results. First of all, GameStop\u00a0expects quarterly sales of $872 million to $892 million. This represents a steep year-over-year decline when compared to $1.237 billion in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nGameStop expects to report quarterly cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.073 billion to $1.093 billion. That range is markedly lower than the $1.31 billion that GameStop recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.\n\nAlong with all of that, GameStop\u00a0prepared investors for an unprofitable first fiscal quarter. It\u2019s yet another reminder that short-squeeze targets like GameStop aren\u2019t always in great financial condition.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop Stock: Don\u2019t Play This Lottery\n\nPaffrath\u2019s lottery analogy might sound harsh, but it\u2019s entirely appropriate. Investing in GameStop, as opposed to day-trading the shares, is akin to gambling. In 2024, as in 2021, you\u2019ll need great luck and timing to achieve multibagger returns.\n\nBefore you take on too much risk, be sure to review GameStop\u2019s financials. I hope that you\u2019ll be persuaded to stay away from GameStop stock right now. It may be tempting to jump on the bandwagon, but the best policy is to just avoid the meme-stock lottery altogether.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The meme-stock rally of 2024 was, for the most part, very short-lived. Moreover, most of the meme stocks became stocks to sell by quickly retreated to points not far above their pre-rally levels. A few factors, in my opinion, caused the surge to last such a short time and largely dissipate so quickly. First, retail investors lack the huge amount of excess cash that they had in the second half of 2020 and 2021. Secondly, it\u2019s likely that short sellers learned from the meme stock rally of several years ago and subsequently developed strategies for dealing with it.\n\nAnd finally, many Wall Street analysts declared that the meme stock rally was entirely unjustified. For example, Morningstar noted that Trading.biz analyst Cory Mitchell had declared that the rally of AMC stock was pure hype. And CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer quickly warned investors to sell meme stocks. Indeed, most meme stocks are still tremendously overvalued and have very poor fundamentals. Here are three meme stocks to sell now.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nPerhaps contributing to the termination of the meme-stock frenzy, GameStop (NYSE:GME) announced on May 17 that it would sell 45 million shares of GME stock. Even more discouraging for the owners of its shares, the struggling video-game retailer disclosed that it estimates its top-line tumbled 29% in Q1 2024 year-over-year. The statistic indicates that the company\u2019s business is rapidly shrinking and heading for major problems.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company stated that the rally of its shares does not appear to be based on its underlying fundamentals. In other words, GameStop does not have a tremendous amount of confidence in its outlook.\n\nEven after its recent, large pullback, GME stock is changing hands at a huge enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 234 times.\n\nGiven all of these points, GameStop is definitely in the category of meme stocks to sell.\n\nFaraday Future (FFIE) In this photo illustration, the Faraday Future logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. FFIR stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric-vehicle maker Faraday Future (NASDAQ:FFIE) was founded way back in 2014 but did not make its first deliveries until Q3 2023. Moreover, the automaker, whose EV, the FF 91 2.0 Futurist, costs a dizzying $309,000, had reportedly only sold ten vehicles as of January 2024.\n\nFurther, an open letter from Faraday\u2019s CEO, released in February, included no concrete indications that the firm had obtained a significant number of orders for the future. Nor did the letter include a clear strategy for obtaining orders.\n\nImpressively, the company claims their EV is is faster than Lamborghini Urus, and has a range of 381 miles. It also has the ability to run many apps, including ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the company only had cash of $6.7 million and debt of $135 million as of September 2023. That, along with its low revenue, makes FFIE a very dangerous bet at this point.\n\nAMC (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJim Cramer correctly pointed out that AMC (NYSE:AMC) may become insolvent in 2026 when it will owe a huge $2 billion.\n\nI believe that if AMC doesn\u2019t go under by that year, it will probably have to sell a gargantuan number of shares. Those massive share sales, in turn, will cause the stock\u2019s value to plummet way below its current value.\n\nAlso not boding well for AMC\u2019s outlook, attendance at its U.S. theaters sank 5.8% last quarter YOY. Meanwhile, its operations burned $268 million of cash in the 12 months that ended in March. The decline in the company\u2019s U.S. attendance indicates that the popularity of movie theaters is once again headed downwards.\n\nDespite all of these huge issues, the shares are changing hands at a relatively high enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 21.8 times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "On May 12, 2024, the internet cheered as the man credited with launching the GameStop (NYSE:GME) short squeeze of 2021 returned to social media. Keith Gill, better known by the online alias \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d randomly shared a drawing of a gamer on X after a multi-year hiatus from the platform. The post did not have much context, but it quickly sparked a meme stock trading frenzy, sending favorites such as GME and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) into the green.\n\nA week later, the meme stock rally has died off, but some lesser-known companies are still rising. If we assess this by progress alone, the winner of the Roaring Kitty rally isn\u2019t GameStop or AMC. It\u2019s Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (NYSE:FFIE), an electric vehicle (EV) producer that many investors have written off. But FFIE stock has been rising all week, and despite some dips, it has surged by truly impressive amounts.\n\nKeep an Eye on FFIE Stock\n\nIn an era when seemingly random companies can surge on unexpected meme stock momentum, whenever a new one arises, it\u2019s best to approach with caution. For all the excitement that erupts when a failing, heavily shorted company starts to surge, the momentum rarely lasts, as the Roaring Kitty rally recently reminded investors. This week, GME stock is back in the red, and AMC is struggling to stay in the green. But FFIE stock is still surging. Even with some volatility, it is up more than 45% for the day.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good day for any stock, and it\u2019s only half over. But to really highlight the difference between this new meme stock and the old r/WallStreetBets favorites, let\u2019s take a look at their performances over the past five days. Despite the many retail investors who pounded the table over a short squeeze early last week, GME and AMC are down 70% and 62%, respectively, for the past five days. But Faraday Future is up almost 1,300% for the same period. Talk about a stark contrast.\n\nIt\u2019s true that FFIE stock still trades at only $1.40 per share. But when we consider the fact that it began May 2024 trading at $0.050, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by this performance. While most other meme stocks were running out of momentum last week, Faraday Future kept climbing, beating the inevitable meme stock slump. Now we\u2019re in a new week and it still shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nHow high can FFIE stock go? At this point, it\u2019s difficult to predict precisely how much room to run it has. But now the momentum from the Roaring Kitty rally has died down, and this new meme stock is still rising. That suggests that Faraday Future may have growth potential beyond the short squeeze. And despite all its growth, it still trades at a low enough price point that many investors may see it as being worth a gamble simply based on its recent performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, unlike GameStop and AMC, Faraday doesn\u2019t operate in a dying industry. As The Economist reports, the only future for the movie theater industry lies in creating a more luxurious experience for consumers. That means a bright future for a company like IMAX Corporation (NYSE:IMAX) but a bleak one for AMC, a company in which even retail investors are losing interest. And GameStop, at its core, is still only a plastic disc retail operating in a troubled industry that is becoming hard to navigate. But the EV market is primed for a rebound, which could help take FFIE stock higher in the coming months.\n\nMost meme stocks have no real growth potential and only rise when a flash-in-the-pan rally strikes. But in the case of FFIE, investors may actually have a struggling company that is worth resurrecting.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Inflation\u2019s Silver Lining: Netflix Stock Poised to Thrive as Streaming Beats Cinemas",
        "content": "For content-streaming stalwart Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the end of the contentious Hollywood writers\u2019 strike couldn\u2019t have come soon enough. As InvestorPlace contributor Marie Brodbeck mentioned, Netflix stock \u201cis reliant on great content to stay afloat, so the strike\u2019s end is a big deal for this streamer.\u201d That\u2019s simply and beautifully put.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of opinion. In the trailing six months, Netflix stock gained nearly 31% of equity value. With the resolution of the strike, the action removed a major restrictor plate stymieing the streaming giant. At the same time, writers going back to work should be a lifeline for cineplex operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).\n\nWhile AMC warned stakeholders of lower revenue ahead of its first-quarter earnings disclosure, management issued a silver lining: once the slate of new movies improves, the company should be back in business. And that\u2019s a reasonable thesis on paper because of the aforementioned strike\u2019s resolution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, the problem is that AMC just hasn\u2019t moved \u2013 in the right direction, that is. In the past six months, the security is down almost 39%. Even at the peak closing price of AMC\u2019s recent meme-fueled rally, it would have fallen short of the Nov. 20 closing price of $7.16.\n\nUnfortunately, the dichotomy may continue to worsen for AMC while improving for Netflix stock.\n\nConsumer Behaviors Shines a Light for Netflix Stock Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to data compiled by Statista, as of May 2022, approximately 55% of surveyed adult Internet users stated that they \u201crarely or never went to the movies\u201d due to being more interested in watching films at home. That\u2019s a huge plus for Netflix stock. At the same time, this behavioral shift is obviously a headwind for AMC and the cineplex business model.\n\nTo be sure, the movie theater isn\u2019t completely obsolete or irrelevant \u2013 far from it. When people want to watch summer blockbusters, nothing beats the immersive experience of the big screen. However, this narrative has lost momentum. Here\u2019s what I had to say about the matte recently:\n\nIn terms of\u00a0top lifetime grosses, Box Office Mojo reveals that most of the top 20 films stemmed from the pre-Covid-19 era. The best-performing post-pandemic film was 2021\u2019s Spider-Man: No Way Home. Notably, the wildly popular and much-anticipated film Top Gun: Maverick \u2014 released in 2022 \u2014 only came in at number five.\n\nOnly five of the top 20 grossing films of all time were released after Covid-19. Interestingly, the original\u00a0Avatar \u2014 released in 2009 \u2014 occupies the number four slot, while its 2022 sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water, landed at number seven.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless the slate of upcoming films is projected to be groundbreaking, it\u2019s doubtful that Hollywood alone can help AMC stock.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not here to pick on AMC. However, its closest rival Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) saw its shares gain nearly 25% in the trailing six months. And even then, the overall performance of CNK has been uninspiring, gaining about 5% in the past 52 weeks.\n\nBottom line, unless the cineplex operators can address the behavioral shift, Netflix stock may continue rising at their expense.\n\nInflation Also Splits Fortunes in the Entertainment Battle An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across\n\nSource: xalien / Shutterstock\n\nFor both businesses and consumers, inflation stinks. However, within the former category, the one comfort that companies have is that if they\u2019re feeling the pressure of accelerating prices, their rivals are too. That\u2019s almost always the case \u2013 except when we\u2019re talking about Netflix stock.\n\nWhile it has become commonplace in the post-pandemic environment to complain about skyrocketing costs, one arena has completely bucked the trend: television sets. They\u2019re getting bigger and cheaper. As a December 2023 CNN report mentioned, some 55-inch TVs are selling (at full price) for under $250.\n\nFor a few hundred bucks more, you can get 70-inch TVs at popular big-box retailers. It\u2019s no wonder why people prefer to watch movies at home. Increasingly, technology and economies of scale are enabling everyday folks to bring the big-screen experience to their living rooms.\n\nSo, with Netflix stock, inflation is great for the underlying business. First, people are able to acquire ridiculous deals on TVs. Second, this framework means that people are incentivized to stay at home to enhance the return of their TV purchases.\n\nOn the other hand, inflation is a substantial challenge for the cineplex industry. The biggest concern here is the rise in ticket prices. It\u2019s a tough situation because the box office has to make money. But as it becomes more expensive to go to the movies, getting a relatively cheap Netflix subscription \u2013 helped by the fundamentals of cheap TVs \u2013 makes increasingly more sense.\n\nTherefore, even on outside matters like inflation and consumer electronics, Netflix stock wins and the classic Hollywood machinery loses.\n\nThe Takeaway: Life Favors NFLX Stock\n\nWith streaming becoming so popular, NFLX stock already enjoyed a major advantage over the traditional box office. However, outside circumstances such as shifting consumer behaviors and even monetary policy have served to help Netflix while simultaneously imposing headwinds against troubled cineplex operators. Unless classic Hollywood does something drastic to change its business model, NFLX will likely continue winning.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC) meme stocks rose substantially last week, gaining over 70%. The return of \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019, prominent investor Keith Gill, has traders wondering which meme stocks to buy next. After three years away from publicity, the trading crowd seems to be hyped up again.\r\n\r\nMarkets have more experience in sharply moving meme stocks now due to retail traders\u2019 participation in coordinating on social media in 2021. Hedge funds are more cautious of unconventional short squeezes, while the financial press is better at identifying surges in social media activity. The market is simply more mature in its understanding of meme stock mania. Despite offering potential stability, price volatility in some stocks remains possible in response to retail traders or social media interest.\r\n\r\nConsequently, savvy traders seek meme stocks to buy whose shares could experience large price moves. Here are three stock picks to pounce on now to get ahead of the curve:\n\nNovavax (NVAX) Concept of NVAX stock vaccine against COVID-19. Glass medical vials with liquid. Ampoules with coronavirus vaccine on a medical glass table\n\nSource: vovidzha / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn interesting stock pick in this list of meme stocks to buy is vaccine development company Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). Just a week ago, the NVAX share price nearly doubled with a 2,000x surge in volumes after Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) announced a $1.2 billion investment in the company. The Novavax market cap before the announcement was just $1.69 billion. Sanofi is interested in Novavax\u2019s Coronavirus vaccine and developing new combination vaccines for Covid-19 and influenza.\r\n\r\nNovavax offers an alternative adjuvanted vaccine against Covid-19. The company\u2019s Matrix-M technology has the potential to be used to develop other vaccines. This makes the partnership with Sanofi interesting, as Sanofi makes some of the top-selling annual flu vaccines.\r\n\r\nNVAX\u2019s meteoric rise in share price could be attractive to retail traders, particularly considering that over a third of its free float is shorted. While the deal with Sanofi may mean Novavax could provide dividends in the future, the company is currently unprofitable, making it a speculative meme stock to buy. In the past, Novavax has already seen a meteoric rise followed by a crash.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), the social trading company, couldn\u2019t be missing from a list of meme stocks to buy. Involved in the previous meme stock rally of 2021, HOOD has seen increased interest over the past week. Analysts have adopted a positive outlook for the Robinhood stock, believing the company remains financially sound even without a resurgence in retail trader activity. They point to accelerating organic sales growth and cost-cutting measures for the company\u2019s valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRecent analyst ratings broadly reflect current market expectations, with an analysts\u2019 price target of $20.39 maintaining pace. However, Robinhood has a history of exceeding analyst forecasts, as demonstrated by last quarter\u2019s earnings quadrupling projections.\r\n\r\nRobinhood has a very high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 138.1x, consistent with meme stocks. However, its relatively low short interest implies the potential to benefit from revived retail trading. This may develop more organically through higher trading volumes rather than attempting a risky short squeeze.\n\nWorkhorse Group (WKHS) Person holding cellphone with logo of American electric vehicle company Workhorse Group Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe electric truck and drone manufacturer Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) displays typical characteristics as one of the meme stocks to buy. The company has recently witnessed its share price rally, surging as high as a 50% gain last week, accompanied by a boom in social media interest. However, this surge did not follow good news. The company announced job cuts back in March in an attempt to conserve cash.\r\n\r\nWorkhorse Group has seen the percentage of short positions rise to over 21%, making it more susceptible to a short squeeze. Few analysts track the WKHS stock, but those who do have been downgrading the company\u2019s outlook. This has placed retail traders at odds with the professionals, revealing a classic set-up preceding a meme stock craze.\n\nWith analysts\u2019 price target settled at $0.57 per share and increasing chances of a short squeeze, the WKHS stock may be due for a 90% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The meme coin frenzy may have cooled off a bit as bitcoin has lost some upward momentum. However, markets for top meme tokens are still more liquid than they were earlier this year, indicating that these supposedly non-serious cryptocurrencies, often criticized for lacking utility, are here to stay.\n\nAccording to Kaiko Research, meme tokens have been resilient during the recent market correction, continuing to perform strongly despite historically being underperformers during downturns. Year-to-date (YTD) returns for these tokens range from 80% to 1800%, with trade volumes remaining strong.\n\nKaiko Research reports that the weekly trade volume for meme tokens surged by more than 200% YTD, reaching around $11 billion. This can be attributed to the tokens' accessibility and their ability to adapt to market trends, which has attracted community interest.\n\n\"Meme tokens have shown an unexpected resilience in the face of market corrections, maintaining strong trade volumes and performance,\" said an analyst from Kaiko Research. \"Their popularity is largely driven by their accessibility and the strong community interest they generate.\"\n\nHowever, meme coins tend to have higher leverage compared to most altcoins and are thus more influenced by speculative appetite.\n\nInterestingly, the correlation between meme tokens and other retail-driven speculative assets, such as meme stocks, has been relatively weak and highly volatile. For instance, the 60-day rolling correlation between the largest meme token, Dogecoin (DOGE), and the video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) has mostly remained below 0.3 over the past year.\n\nOver the past week, meme stocks received an unexpected boost, with GME and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) seeing a surge on May 13-14. This caused the correlation between DOGE and GME to reach its highest level in over a year.\n\n\"Meme stocks saw a notable uptick last week, which also affected the correlation between Dogecoin and GameStop,\" Kaiko Research added. \"This spike in correlation highlights the interconnected nature of retail-driven speculative assets.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDogecoin, meme token volumes remain resilient - Kaiko Research\n\nSEC likely to deny new Ether ETFs this week\n\nBitcoin price today: flat at $67k as analysts await more Fed cues\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Robinhood (NYSE:HOOD): Picks-and-Shovels Play on Meme Stock Resurgence",
        "content": "Forget about Gamestop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Robinhood Markets stock is the picks-and-shovels way to invest in the resurgence of meme stocks.\n\nWith meme stock mania seemingly heating back up, investors are eyeing shares of some of 2021\u2019s big meme stocks again. But rather than chase shares of a specific meme stock, the smart way to invest in the theme of retail investors piling back into the market is to invest in Robinhood Markets, which will continue to benefit from the influx of retail investors and increased trading volume.\n\nIn this sense, Robinhood can be thought of as the picks-and-shovels way to play a return of retail activity. Unlike Gamestop or AMC, I believe it\u2019s a great stock in its own right and doesn\u2019t need any short squeeze to head higher.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Robinhood stock based on its excellent user and deposit growth, its positioning as a picks-and-shovels play on increasing activity from retail investors, and its successful foray into new areas like IRAs and credit cards. The latter initiative is transforming Robinhood from a retail brokerage to a comprehensive financial powerhouse.\n\nMeme Stock Reawakening\n\nAs you\u2019ve likely seen by now, a Tweet from Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, the ringleader behind Gamestop\u2019s massive 2021 rally that set off the original \u201cmeme stock\u201d mania, marked his return to the platform after a multi-year hiatus. Many investors took this as a signal to rush into Gamestop and other meme stocks of that era, sending shares of these stocks on a wild ride this week.\n\nHowever, most of these investors would admit that this is a troubled company with less-than-promising long-term prospects, and the stock has considerable downside risk. For example, the GME stock\u2019s price target of $7 shows that even after the recent pullback, the stock still has downside potential of 68.5% (see below). Meanwhile, Robinhood is a thriving, growing business with a bright future.\n\nPicks-and-Shovels Play\n\nAs the go-to brokerage app for many new investors and retail investors, Robinhood is well-positioned to capitalize on an influx of new traders and a spike in trading activity. Currently, Robinhood is the #11 finance app in Apple\u2019s App Store, trailing everyday payments apps like Cash App and Venmo but leading the likes of Fidelity, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), a considerable achievement for the much smaller company.\n\nRobinhood recently released updated metrics for April, showing that business is booming. An impressive 90,000 customers opened accounts during the month, meaning that Robinhood now has 24 million customers. Robinhood also took in $4.9 billion in deposits. This represents a 45% annualized growth rate versus March. With this influx, the company has now taken in $27.4 billion in deposits over the last 12 months, representing 35% annualized growth versus April 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd keep in mind that these numbers are from before the meme stock resurgence kicked off in May. As more retail investors return to the market or are drawn to the market for the first time by news of the wild swings of meme stocks, Robinhood\u2019s user and deposit growth should continue.\n\nThis growth prompted Bank of America Securities to give Robinhood a double upgrade from Underperform to Buy, based on \u201c(1) rising retail engagement and accelerating organic growth; (2) positive operating leverage after large expense reductions; (3) attractive valuation following increases in EBITDA/EPS.\u201d Bank of America increased its price target on Robinhood from $14 to $24.\n\nBeyond meme stocks, Robinhood has made great progress in building the platform, expanding into new areas, and becoming a true financial ecosystem for its users.\n\nAttacking New Verticals\n\nThis isn\u2019t the same old Robinhood that it was in 2021 during the last meme stock frenzy. I previously covered Robinhood and its underrated transformation into a full-service financial ecosystem several months ago, and the stock has performed well since then. Robinhood launched IRAs last year and has made an aggressive move into the market by offering a 1% match on rollover deposits and a 3% match on deposits for Robinhood Gold members.\n\nThese maneuvers are helping it attract customers from its competitors. CEO Vlad Tenev says that the first quarter was the second quarter in a row in which the company had \u201cnet asset inflows from every other major brokerage \u2014 totaling $3 billion, more than twice our Q4 level.\u201d\n\nRobinhood is also making a splash in the credit card market with the launch of its upcoming Robinhood Gold card, which will be one of the offerings within its Robinhood Gold subscription service.\n\nThe eye-catching gold card, which is made of stainless steel and weighs in at 17 grams, offers users unlimited 3% cash back on all purchases. Tenev says that over one million customers have signed up for the Gold card waitlist and stated, \u201cWe can substantially grow Gold adoption as we roll out the card.\u201d The card could be a major growth driver for Robinhood Gold membership, as only half of the people on the waitlist are current Gold subscribers.\n\nTenev says that Robinhood Gold subscribers hit 1.7 million during the first quarter after 260,000 new customers signed up.\u00a0With these new offerings, Robinhood is smartly leveraging its success with retail investors in its brokerage business to move into new verticals, increase wallet share with its customers, and capture further growth.\n\nIs Robinhood Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, HOOD earns a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, eight Holds, and four Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average HOOD stock price target of $20.86 implies 3.8% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: An Up and Coming Financial Powerhouse\n\nRather than chasing after a stock like Gamestop during this meme stock revival, Robinhood could potentially be the best way to invest in a resurgence of retail investor activity. I\u2019m bullish on Robinhood because of the strong user growth and deposit growth it has already demonstrated this year and because it\u2019s well-positioned to capture further growth as more retail investors foray into the market.\n\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s expansion into lucrative verticals like IRAs and credit cards and its momentum in these areas have the potential to transform it from a retail brokerage into a true financial powerhouse over time. This makes it an attractive long-term investment opportunity, in my view.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

This surge was buoyed by inflation data that was broadly in line with expectations, easing concerns from the first quarter about resuming price pressures and bolstering investor expectations for potential interest rate cuts.\n\nIn April, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3.4% compared to the same month last year, down slightly from March's 3.5% annual rate and matching estimates.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the 40,000 mark on Thursday, pushing its bull market rally to nearly a 25% surge since October.\n\nAmong sectors, semiconductors, as tracked by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX), continued to outperform, as sentiment toward AI-driven growth remains elevated.\n\nMeme Stocks On Rollercoaster\n\nA key market theme during the week was the resurgence of meme-related stocks. Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) skyrocketed on Monday and Tuesday as social media influencer Keith Gill, known for sparking the 2021 meme stock frenzy, returned after a three-year break.\n\nGameStop Tanks\n\nGameStop shares dropped 25.9% following the announcement Friday of a 45-million-share offering and disappointing preliminary first-quarter revenue estimates, which came in below analyst expectations.\n\nReddit Partners With OpenAI\n\nRedditInc. (NASDAQ:RDDT) stock spiked higher after announcing a partnership with OpenAI. The collaboration will grant OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT access to Reddit data and introduce AI-powered features to Reddit.\n\nBuffett Buys Chubb\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire HathawayInc (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) acquired 26 million shares of Chubb Ltd (NYSE:CB), signaling confidence in the insurer despite challenges in the insurance market due to climate change. The $6.7-billion stake has made Chubb Berkshire\u2019s ninth-largest holding.\n\nDimon's Fiscal Warning\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), expressed concern over the national deficit, which reached $1.9 trillion in 2024, representing over 6% of GDP. Dimon emphasized the need for the government to address this issue to avoid potential economic instability, stressing the importance of balancing deficit reduction with sustainable growth.\n\nCybertruck Lags Rivals\n\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u2019s Cybertruck, launched in November 2023, trails behind Ford Motor Co.\u2018s (NYSE:F) F-150 Lightning in registrations, but surpasses Rivian Automotive Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:RIVN) R1T and General Motors Co.\u2018s (NYSE:GM) Silverado EV.

        "content": "Why Is Robinhood (HOOD) Stock Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) jumped 7.5% in the morning session after it received a double rating upgrade from Bank of America analyst. The analyst upgraded the stock's rating from Underperform (Sell) to Buy and raised the price target from $14 to $24. The new price target represents more than a 25% upside from where shares traded when the upgrade was announced. The analyst added, citing the reasons for the upgrade, \"We view the current entry point as the opposite of 2021 when we initiated at Underperform after its IPO given: (1) rising retail engagement and accelerating organic growth; (2) positive operating leverage after large expense reductions; (3) attractive valuation following increases in EBITDA/EPS.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy Robinhood? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nRobinhood's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 19 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago, when the company gained 9.9% as heavily shorted stocks (so-called meme stocks) continued to rally, with both AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) up more than 60%. On May 13, 2024, famous Wall Street Bets (Reddit stock trading forum) trader Keith Gill (known online as Roaring Kitty) returned to Twitter (also known as X) after three years, fueling a greater retail appetite for meme stocks. These moves could also drive volumes on trading platforms such as Robinhood as more retail investors jump on the bandwagon.\n\nRobinhood is up 61.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $19.93 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $20.13 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood's shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $572.66.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "title": "Wedbush Just Slashed Its Price Target on These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Widely known for its coverage of popular growth stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), much like the old E.F. Hutton slogan, when Wedbush Securities talks, people listen. As such, many in the market may take caution with the stocks with lowered price targets that the sell-side firm covers.\n\nBut much like how unthinkingly following sell-side ratings may not necessarily result in success in the market, you may not want to assume that a stock with a lowered price target is doomed to produce poor returns.\n\nInstead, factors like lowered price targets are among many criteria to consider before making an investment decision.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s look at three stocks that have recently received lowered price targets from Wedbush.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWedbush has maintained a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) since August 2023, when it raised its rating on the movie theater chain\u2019s shares from \u201cunderperform.\u201d\n\nOn May 9, however, the sell-side firm trimmed its price target on AMC stock from $4 to $3.50 per share. The trimming may slightly reduce, but this re-rating underscores Wedbush\u2019s view on AMC\u2019s underlying value. Arguably, one should take it as a sign to exercise caution following the recent wave of meme mania.\n\nThis speculative frenzy sent AMC from around $3 to as much as $11.88 per share this week. While the stock has since started crashing back down to prior price levels, more downside may lie ahead. Why? The market could bid AMC lower as it digests the company\u2019s decision to raise more capital through the dilutive issuance and sale of new shares.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another name on the list of stocks with lowered price targets from Wedbush. According to The Fly, right after the Facebook parent\u2019s latest quarterly earnings release last month, Wedbush maintained its \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the stock but lowered its price target from $570 to $480 per share.\n\nMETA stock has climbed back toward this revised price target following a post-earnings plunge. On one hand, Wedbush\u2019s target makes sense. Shares currently trade for around 24.1 times earnings, on par with similar \u201cMag 7\u201d stocks like Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nOn the other hand, if Meta continues to cut costs successfully and capitalize on generative AI, and if the digital ad market remains strong, it could hit the high end of earnings forecasts in 2025 ($26.50 per share). If this happens, shares could hit prices well above Wedbush\u2019s prior price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is another one of the stocks with lowered price targets from Wedbush following a quarterly earnings release. The online entertainment platform operator beat expectations with its latest numbers, but analysts and investors were very disappointed in its updates to guidance.\n\nWith Roblox guiding for much lower adjusted revenue through the rest of 2024, it\u2019s no surprise that RBLX stock fell 22% after the earnings release. It\u2019s also unsurprising that Wedbush slashed its price target from $56 to $46 per share. The analyst firm, however, does continue to give shares an \u201coutperform\u201d rating.\n\nIn my view, even with this target cut, Wedbush remains generous in its assessment of Roblox. With the company continuing to report net losses, its current market cap of around $20.3 billion appears excessive. Unless growth quickly picks back up, it\u2019s hard to see shares sustaining, much adding to this current valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures moved little in evening deals on Thursday, tracking a weak finish on Wall Street as several Federal Reserve officials warned that bets on interest rate cuts were potentially premature.\n\nSome softer-than-expected consumer inflation readings drove Wall Street to record highs on Wednesday and Thursday. But indexes failed to hold those highs after the Fed warnings, while traders also slightly trimmed their expectations for a September rate cut.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,320.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat at 18,653.0 points by 19:36 ET (23:36 GMT). Dow Jones Futures were flat at 40,017.0 points.\n\nA rebound in Treasury yields also weighed on stocks.\n\nFed officials warn more confidence needed to cut\n\nA slew of Fed officials warned on Wednesday and Thursday that the central bank still needed more confidence to cut interest rates, and that the timing of the move remained uncertain.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic welcomed the softer inflation data, but warned that one positive data point did not indicate a trend, and that no expectations for rate cuts were locked in by the central bank.\n\nBefore Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams said that while the development in consumer inflation was positive, it still did not warrant an immediate reduction in interest rates.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that the Fed needed to hold rates high for longer to bring inflation down, and that the central bank needed more evidence that price pressures were cooling.\n\nAll three Fed officials are voting members of the Fed's rate-setting committee.\n\nTheir comments saw investors second-guess expectations for rate cuts this year, with traders slightly paring bets on a 25 basis point reduction in September, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.\n\nWall St loses steam after record highs\n\nPersistent doubts over the rate cuts saw Wall Street close lower on Thursday after making record highs. The prospect of high for longer interest rates bodes poorly for stock valuations, especially in the technology sector.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,297.10 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 0.3% to 16,698.32 points on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 39,869.38 points.\n\nAftermarket movers: Reddit surges on OpenAI partnership\n\nAmong major after-hours movers, social media platform Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) jumped over 11% after it entered a partnership with artificial intelligence major OpenAI to add its content to the firm\u2019s AI products.\n\nTake-Two Interactive Software Inc (NASDAQ:TTWO) fell 2.6% after it issued disappointing annual earnings guidance, with the videogame publisher set to release its hotly awaited GTA VI title only in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nDXC Technology Co (NYSE:DXC) sank 20% after it also offered disappointing annual guidance.\n\nSo-called meme stocks GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) saw some relief in after-hours trade, rising 3.4% and 5.9%, respectively. The two plummeted between 15% and 30% on Thursday as a rebound rally ran dry.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS futures flat as Fed comments cool rate cut optimism\n\nEarnings call: Under Armour outlines turnaround strategy amid challenges\n\nEarnings call: Copa Holdings announced a net profit of $176.1 million\n\nView comments",

If you are one of these investors and want another way to play AMC stock in particular, you could invest in one of its largest landlords.\n\nEPR Properties\n\nEPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) is a leading owner and manager of experiential real estate. Its portfolio currently consists of 359 entertainment, recreation, education, and leisure properties, including movie theaters, golf ranges, waterparks, amusement parks, fitness centers, private schools, and early childhood education centers. Movie theaters make up 37% of its portfolio with tenants including AMC, Cinemark, Regal, and Alamo Drafthouse.\n\nIn the Spotlight:\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here's how you can collect passive rental income without being a landlord. Elon Musk, Ken Griffin and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nEPR Properties currently pays a monthly dividend of $0.285 per share, equating to an annualized dividend of $3.42 per share, which gives its stock a yield of about _% at the time of this writing..\n\nEPR had an impressive track record of dividend growth before it was forced to suspend its dividend as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, with operations back to normal, the company is on pace for 2024 to mark the third consecutive year in which it has raised its annual dividend payment, and this could be the start to a very long streak.\n\nEPR is a great way to play the success of AMC over the long term.\n\nMore to Read:\n\nPassive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup to generate monthly rental income without having to purchase their own property. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nImage Credit: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article This Is a Much Safer Way to Invest in the Success of AMC Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Here Are 2 ETFs To Ride The Latest Wave\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMeme stocks are, once again, taking center stage following the return of Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d to social media after a nearly three-year hiatus. Gill, a central figure in the meme stock phenomenon that rocked the market in early 2021, has reignited interest in these volatile yet potentially lucrative investments.\n\nGameStop Inc. (NASDAQ:GME), the struggling video game retailer at the heart of the meme stock frenzy, witnessed a staggering 60.1% gain on Tuesday, closing at $48.75 after hitting a high of $64.83 earlier in the day. This surge comes on the heels of Gill\u2019s recent social media post, which has garnered over 19 million views and sparked a viral reaction among investors.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), another prominent meme stock, also experienced significant gains, rising 31.98% on Tuesday. The renewed interest in meme stocks has investors wondering if this is the beginning of another wild ride.\n\nFor those looking to capitalize on the latest meme stock wave, two Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) stand out as potential vehicles:\n\nSchwab Crypto Thematic ETF (NYSE:STCE)\n\nThe Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF gained 3.96% on Tuesday, benefiting from its unique blend of investments in key cryptocurrency companies and meme-related stocks. By combining digital finance with viral market trends, this ETF offers exposure to the dynamic world of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nTop holdings in the fund include MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK), and Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA). GameStop also features in the fund\u2019s portfolio, with a weight of 1.96%.\n\nAmplify Video Game Tech ETF (NYSE:GAMR)\n\nThe Amplify Video Game Tech ETF, which gained 5.11% on Tuesday, is another option for investors seeking exposure to meme stocks. The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in companies primarily engaged in supporting or utilizing the video gaming industry.\n\nTop holdings include GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), Bilibili Inc (NASDAQ:BILI), and Embracer Group AB (EMBRACB SS). GameStop alone accounts for 5.29% of the fund\u2019s market value, making it a significant player in the ETF\u2019s performance.\n\nWhile meme stocks offer the potential for rapid gains, investors should be aware of the risks associated with these highly volatile investments. Unlike traditional stocks, which are influenced by fundamental analysis and corporate performance, meme stocks are often subject to rapid price changes driven by hype and mass trading actions.\n\nStory continues\n\nTargeting More Sustainable, Long-Term Gains\n\nFor those seeking more reliable long-term gains, an investment like Cityfunds may be a more suitable option. Cityfunds offers investors the opportunity to own fractional shares of high-quality homes in top-performing cities across the United States. By investing in a diversified portfolio of carefully selected properties, investors can benefit from the potential appreciation of the real estate market without the volatility associated with meme stocks.\n\nWith a low minimum investment of $500 and a user-friendly platform, Cityfunds makes it easy for investors to build wealth through real estate. The experienced team at Cityfunds handles all management aspects, allowing investors to enjoy passive income and long-term growth potential without the hassles of direct property ownership.\n\nClick here to explore the cities you can invest in through Cityfunds. \r\nAs the meme stock phenomenon reignites, investors must carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before diving in. While ETFs like STCE and GAMR offer exposure to this exciting market segment, more risk-averse investors may find greater peace of mind and stability in real estate investments like Cityfunds. Ultimately, a well-diversified portfolio that balances high-risk, high-reward investments with more stable, long-term growth opportunities may be the key to financial success in these unpredictable times.\n\nThis article Are Meme Stocks Ready To Rip Again?

        "content": "Donald Trump's Truth Social Shows 55% Increase In Site Traffic Since IPO As Stock Rockets 123% From Lows Amid Short Squeeze Speculation\n\nTruth Social, through its public entity Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT), has been on an incredibly volatile run since officially going public in March. Following its IPO, the company reached highs of $79.38 before going on a monthlong sell-off to $22.55. The stock has since rallied as much as 138% since its lows, closing at over $54 last Thursday before taking a breather down to $50.99 on Friday.\n\nThe volatility is attributed to two factors. The initial downfall was from an objectively overvalued valuation following its IPO. At its high, the company was valued at over $8 billion. Despite this, the company only had $751k in revenue for the quarter ending in December while sitting on a $9 million loss. The Axios estimates Truth Social has roughly five million monthly active users.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nStartup behind \u2018the #1 free contractor app' grows 162% YoY, opens its doors for investors at a $100 minimum. Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women\u2019s health problem at 80 cents per share.\n\nComparatively, Reddit Inc. (NYSE:RDDT) is also currently worth about $8 billion, but its recent quarter showed $249 million in revenue and $18.53 million in net income. Recent estimates put Reddit at 73 million monthly active users.\n\nBy several metrics, Truth Social is objectively overvalued hence the initial nearly 80% drop in the company. Like many initial public offerings, companies will rise fast as investors flock to acquire a stake in the company. This often creates an initial steep rise in the stock, which causes short-term investors to flood the stock hoping to make money on its way up, just as happened with DJT.\n\nAn inflated valuation coupled with those same short-term investors selling off caused the initial sell-off. Another huge factor was a swath of investors opening massive short positions on the company. An inflated valuation coupled with an army of political dissidents caused a swath of investors to line up and open massive short positions on the company.\n\nTrending: Invest like a millionaire. Exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire.\n\nWhen investors open short positions on a company, they sell the stock first causing the price to go down. As it drops, they make money when they buy the stock back. When a lot of investors short a stock, it will cause a short-term price decline, but those same investors eventually need to buy the stock back. If the stock doesn't decline, shorts can be open to unlimited liability as the price climbs, eventually resulting in the account being margin-called and the broker requires the account to purchase the stock back. This is what's called a \"short squeeze.'\n\nStory continues\n\nNotable names like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) were notably a part of short squeezes from early to mid-2021 causing their stock to rocket over 1500%.\n\nDJT has begun using these same tactics intentionally in an attempt to keep its stock price afloat and is likely a contributing factor in the recent climb from its yearly lows. DJT's CEO, Devin Nunes, has begun issuing statements blaming the decline on short selling, telling shareholders how to lock up their shares, sending letters to Congress calling for an investigation, and informing the Nasdaq of suspected stock manipulation from naked short selling.\n\nAccording to Webull, as of April 30, there were 5.35 million shares sold short and growing. At its current share price, that means $272 million in stock is currently being sold short and will eventually need to be bought back. The short interest has doubled since February and continuing to climb.\n\nAnother contributing factor could be the increased attention and underlying growth of the platform itself, however. In February, Truth Social had roughly five million website visits according to SimilarWeb. In March, the same month as the DJT's initial public offering, the company grew over 55% to 7.74 million visitors. In April, it declined to 6.5 million which is still a 30% growth from February. With more publicity from Trump's ongoing trial and the upcoming election, the platform could see a continued surge of users from the ongoing bouts of publicity.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.

        "content": "Robinhood (HOOD) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) jumped 9.9% in the morning session after heavily shorted stocks (so-called meme stocks) continued to rally, with both AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) up more than 60%. On May 13, 2024, famous Wall Street Bets (Reddit stock trading forum) trader Keith Gill (known online as Roaring Kitty) returned to Twitter (also known as X) after three years, fueling a greater retail appetite for meme stocks. These moves could also drive volumes on trading platforms such as Robinhood as more retail investors jump on the bandwagon.\n\nIs now the time to buy Robinhood? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nRobinhood's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 18 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 2 months ago, when the stock gained 13.3% after the company provided its February 2024 operating data reflecting strong asset growth and higher trading volumes. Although its funded customers were only up by 130k compared to the previous month (23.6 million total), its Assets Under Custody (AUC) rose to $118.7 billion, representing a 16% month-on-month increase. This was driven by growing momentum in the public markets, which led to higher stock and cryptocurrency prices, and new inflows from existing customers into Robinhood's retirement products, which are offering customers a 3% match on any contributions. As a result, it wasn't surprising that volumes were up across all asset classes compared to the previous month. Notably, equity trading volumes were $80.9 billion (up 36% m/m) while crypto trading volumes were $6.5 billion (up 10% m/m). Given the increased platform activities, Securities Lending Revenue also benefitted and came in at $13 million, up 8%. Overall, the data showed Robinhood is performing well in the near term.\n\nRobinhood is up 49.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $18.48 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $20.13 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood's shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $530.59.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Movie theaters are in trouble. With so many ways to consume entertainment content, the box office business model lost its appeal \u2014 which is bad news for Cinemark (NYSE:CNK). So, what\u2019s a speculator to do in this case? For CNK stock, it\u2019s time to hitch a ride on the resurgence of the meme stocks phenomenon.\n\nTo make a long story short, Keith Gill \u2013 who goes by the online moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d \u2013 returned to social media on Sunday, potentially revitalizing the meme movement that he kicked off. Several former trades associated with the phenomenon, particularly Cinemark competitor AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), skyrocketed on the development.\n\nObviously, the news is more pertinent to AMC. It closed the Monday session up more than 78%. CNK stock returned just under 5%. Still, it\u2019s possible that because AMC has ripped so high, so quickly, speculators could see better value with Cinemark.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPlus, as remarkable as a performance that AMC printed, it\u2019s wildly risky. Even with the stratospheric run, AMC is down 87% over the past 52 weeks. In contrast, CNK is up more than 6%. There\u2019s just more confidence associated with Cinemark, even if only on a relative scale.\n\nCinemark Could be a Short Squeeze Candidate\n\nEven though Cinemark beat Wall Street projections for the top and bottom lines for the first quarter, the downward trend is evident.\n\nIn Q1 of this year, revenue came in at $579 million. However, in the year-ago quarter, sales stood at $611 million. Now, it\u2019s true that the Hollywood writers\u2019 strike impacted the entertainment offerings. Further, industry insiders are looking forward to a more exciting slate in the second half of this year and beyond. Still, the fundamental data isn\u2019t encouraging. And moviegoers are turned off by rising ticket prices.\n\nInterestingly, though, the headwinds have contributed to a dour profile for CNK stock. Currently, short interest stands at a whopping 27.26% of the float. Further, the short ratio (or the time required to unwind all short positions based on average trading volume) clocks in at 13.05 days to cover.\n\nOrdinarily, that\u2019s bad news. However, if CNK stock rises unexpectedly, the bears will find themselves exposed to margin calls. The subsequent covering action could fuel an upside panic, which would be amazing for the bulls.\n\nTrade of the Day: Gamble on CNK Stock Call Options\n\nWith the context of the possible short squeeze, hardened gamblers may consider the trade of the day: Buying risky CNK stock call options. Specifically, I\u2019m looking at the 19 July 2024 $20 call.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart by Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace.com\n\nFrankly, with an ask price of 60 cents and a bid of 45 cents (with the midpoint coming in at 53 cents), the bid-ask spread is incredibly wide at 28.3%. You really have to have conviction that the short squeeze narrative will pan out for this trade to make sense. At the same time, human psychology is powerful, especially when dealing with meme stocks.\n\nOn the positive side, this July $20 call features relatively high volume and open interest compared to other derivative contracts. In addition, the implied volatility (IV) comes in at 40.5%, which is not far from the historical volatility (HV) of 32.62%. Given the limited spread between the IV and HV, it might make more sense to buy the option rather than to sell it.\n\nNevertheless, this is not a trade to hold onto for too long. If you make a profit from it, you might want to book it and leave.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Because the company's software products have higher profit margins than its hardware products, it missed Wall Street's estimates on nearly every profitability metric. The company also didn't provide any guidance and said it would not host a conference call to discuss the results, which raises an eyebrow. Overall, this was a bad quarter for GameStop.\n\nGameStop is up 82.7% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of GameStop's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,746.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "GameStop's Rally Resumes In May - What Sparked The Interest?\n\nGameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) stock soared in premarket trading on Monday amid possible retail investor interest following a social media post by Roaring Kitty.\n\nShares of struggling video game retailer GameStop surged around 60% in May from $10.91 on May 1 to $17.46 today but remain far from the peak of around $81.2 in 2021.\n\n\u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d a.k.a\u00a0Keith Gill, a social\u00a0media persona whose online posts reportedly sparked a trading frenzy in the so-called \u2018meme stock\u2019 in early 2021, returned on X.com (formerly Twitter) after three years.\n\nGameStop stock also gained on Friday on heavy volume as traders circulated a screenshot of The Roaring Kitty\u2019s X account showing the account liked a post from February,\u00a0referencing the\u00a0film,\u00a0\u201cRun, Lola, Run.\n\nOn Sunday, Gill\u00a0shared a drawing depicting a man leaning forward in a chair, a widely recognized meme among gamers signaling heightened intensity or seriousness.\n\nIt is his first post on X after being notably absent on social media platforms since mid-2021.\n\nIn March,\u00a0GameStop reported first-quarter earnings that came\u00a0below the consensus, sending the shares trade lower.\n\nGill\u2019s Reddit posts in the\u00a0Wallstreetbets group, boasting about his profits from investing in GameStop, ignited the meme stock frenzy of 2021.\n\nThe rally had spread to highly shorted stocks, including\u00a0AMC Entertainment Holdings\u00a0Inc (NYSE:AMC), as Reddit users banded together to squeeze hedge funds\u00a0who\u00a0had bet against GameStop and other firms.\n\nRoaring Kitty sparked a frenzy among day traders, who rallied to invest heavily in GameStop stocks and call options from 2020 to 2021.\n\nThis collective action caused a short squeeze, resulting in GameStop shares skyrocketing by 1,700%.\n\nThis movement targeted hedge fund\u00a0Melvin Capital, which was betting against GameStop and suffered significant losses.\n\nCitadel and Point72 injected nearly $3 billion to stabilize Melvin\u2019s finances.\n\nThe craze led to trading restrictions on platforms like\u00a0Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) due to clearinghouse margin issues, prompting a class-action lawsuit dismissed in August 2023.\n\nGill faced another lawsuit, accusing him of misrepresenting himself as a novice trader despite being a licensed professional.\n\nThe events of 2021 were later adapted into the movie\u00a0\u201cDumb Money,\u201d\u00a0with\u00a0Paul Dano portraying Gill.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as meme investing, shook Wall Street, and the Reddit group WallStreetBets introduced a novel approach to investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next: Reddit, Social Media Giant Behind GameStop Saga, Plans $10B March IPO.\n\nPrice Action: GME shares are up 45.10% at $25.34 during the premarket session at last check Monday.\n\nPhoto Courtesy 1take1shot On Shutterstock.com\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nGAMESTOP (GME): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article GameStop's Rally Resumes In May - What Sparked The Interest? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "3 Media Stocks to Buy While AMC Continues Falling",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret AMC (NYSE:AMC) stock is not doing well right now. It\u2019s down 47% year-to-date (YTD) and 93% in the last 12 months. Now, AMC is down 94% in the past five years. Its stock declined after Q1 results were released last week. This happened despite it exceeding consensus estimates for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS).\n\nNowadays, at-home streaming services offer blockbuster quality films. And major movie studios make their in-theater films available on streaming services much sooner. Plus, attending the movies has become far too expensive at a time when people are budget trimming.\n\nTherefore, plenty of opportunity is on the table for other media companies to benefit. So, instead of buying AMC stock, you should look at these three media stocks to buy instead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSony Group Corp (SONY) Sony logo on the side of a building at its offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis week\u2019s breaking news in media was Sony\u2019s (NYSE:SONY) announcement of its attempt to acquireParamount (NASDAQ:PARA). SONY, led by its bidding group Sony Pictures Entertainment and private equity firm Apollo, offered $26 billion in cash.\n\nParamount owns several well known channels including Nickelodeon, MTV, CBS and Paramount Pictures. But it has struggled to remain profitable thanks to the decline of cable TV and the underperformance of its streaming service. Sony\u2019s offer has strong support from many Paramount shareholders, who would prefer it to the alternative of a Skydance merger.\n\nWhile SONY is down both YTD and in the last 12 months, it is up 70% in the last five years. Considering Sony Group Corp. is involved in many media types like video game software, electronics manufacturing and music, it remains diversified. Thus, this could help protect its overall stock price against major changes in any one sector.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit (RDDT) paper logo lies with envelope full of dollar bills and smartphone. Reddit IPO\n\nSource: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor investors who want to take a little bit more of a risk, consider Reddit (NYSE:RDDT). On Monday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) raised its target price on Reddit from $45 to $50 per share, maintaining a neutral rating. Then, the company\u2019s debut earnings report came out on Tuesday, and the stock climbed 9% to $51.33.\n\nRevenue increased 48% to $243 million for the first quarter year-over-year (YOY). That beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 14%. Importantly, it reported an ad revenue increase of 39%. However, it showed an overall net loss of $575.1 million. Still, the number of average daily users was 8% higher than expected.\n\nCompare Reddit to the other social media stock that had an IPO this year, Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). It just had its accounting firm charged with massive fraud. Thus, RDDT definitely looks like a much stronger bet.\n\nStory continues\n\nIMAX Corp (IMAX) the exterior of an Imax theater\n\nSource: imageAllan / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive to suggest a movie-related media stock after lamenting the recent dramatic reduction in theater attendance. But IMAXCorp (NYSE:IMAX) may offer a unique way to see profits in this industry in the future.\n\nThe company collected $1.06 billion worldwide in 2023, the second-largest year in its history. Ticket sales were up 24% from 2022. Also, IMAX saw net income of $25 million in 2023, a turnaround from the previous year\u2019s loss of $23 million.\n\nMany people now view a trip to the movies as a special treat, with some choosing films in IMAX theaters to enhance viewer experience. For example, in 2023, IMAX was touted as the best way to watch Oppenheimer. The movie was IMAX\u2019s biggest earner in 2023, generating $183.2 million from IMAX screens. Also, it pushed the company to its highest-grossing summer ever in 54 countries, including the U.S. and China.\n\nIf IMAX can capture this enthusiasm and translate it into partnerships with more theaters and production companies, it could lead to a decidedly profitable future.\n\nWhile its stock has been down for the last five years, it is up 13% YTD. But considering four of those years were during the pandemic, that\u2019s not surprising.\u00a0Therefore, the future could be bright for the movie industry\u2019s brightest screens.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "content": "The stock market is off to a washing machine kind of start for 2024, with gains and lulls that keep investors guessing. In this type of market, it\u2019s equally important to identify not only the best stocks to buy, but F-rated stock picks to avoid a summer slump.\n\nThe benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average is up only 3% in 2024, while the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 are both doing better with 8% gains. So, there are plenty of stocks to choose from that would be solid picks for your portfolio.\n\nHowever, weakness in electric vehicles and some consumer sectors continue to plague the market. Meme stocks are wildly unpredictable but often lead to more pain than gain.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Portfolio Grader rates all stocks in the market on an \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d scale to help determine the best stocks to buy and the key stock picks to avoid.\n\nBy evaluating stocks based on earnings performance, growth, momentum and analyst sentiment, the Portfolio Grader allows you to quickly identify which stocks could create the most pain for your portfolio.\n\nThese names are all F-rated stock picks to avoid this month.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is a struggling electric vehicle manufacturer that was once seen to be a potential rival for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). But it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\n\nTesla is among the EV companies that are in a slump right now, as Tesla slashed the prices of its vehicles to make them more appealing to customers, but at the same time greatly reduced its profit margin and slowed profit growth.\n\nAnd Lucid hasn\u2019t been able to scale its business to be anything more than an afterthought in the EV world, delivering only 6,001 vehicles in all of 2023. Its velocity increased only slightly in the first quarter, when the company manufactured 1,728 vehicles and delivered 1,967.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter was $172.7 million, up from $149.4 million a year ago. But the company also lost $729 million in the quarter, which was similar to its $772 million loss in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company is making an effort \u2014 it secured an agreement with the Ayar Third Investment Company, which is an affiliate of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which is buying $1 billion in Lucid Group preferred shares.\n\nIt also has a new partnership with the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, which is a Saudi Arabian-based government organization that will work with Lucid on projects.\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough to move the needle \u2014 especially as Lucid continues to post massive quarterly losses. LCID stock is down 36% in 2024 and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) Image of the entrance of an AMC Entertainment (AMC) branded theater.\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) operates a chain of 900 movie theaters that provide a total of 10,000 screens.\n\nMeme stocks are essentially companies that are popular with retail investors and pushed by users on various social media platforms. Often meme stocks can be subject to short squeezes if a group of retail investors believe that hedge funds are trying to short a stock.\n\nBut the problem with many meme stocks is that the fundamentals and performance of the company doesn\u2019t match the valuation, and that\u2019s where AMC comes in.\n\nAMC has its supporters, despite a tough 2023 that saw a writers\u2019 strike in Hollywood that stopped production, as well as the continued rise in streaming services that make watching movies at home more appealing.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $951.4 million, down slightly from $954.4 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company also reported a net loss of $163.5 million and 62 cents per share, which was an improvement from a loss of $235.5 million and $1.71 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nAt best, AMC is a stagnant business. The stock is down 47% this year and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a play on clean energy. The company makes a battery that uses hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity. The only byproduct is water vapor.\n\nWhile Plug Power\u2019s battery is theoretically appealing for businesses and communities that want to lower their carbon footprints, the reality for investors is that Plug Power hasn\u2019t been able to make the business profitable.\n\nThose losses continued in the first quarter of 2024, in which Plug Power reported revenue of $68.2 million, down from $182 million a year ago. Losses grew to $159 million from $69.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nPLUG stock continues to lose ground. The stock is down 47% this year and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) logo in front of stock market price graph\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second and most infamous of the meme stocks on this list is GameStop (NYSE:GME).\n\nHedge funds famously shorted the retailer in 2021, but retail investors rescued the company with a memorable short squeeze.\n\nThe whole episode was the subject of a film, Dumb Money, in 2023. While the short squeeze is long over, GameStop carries on, giving back all the gains that it earned during those heady but illogical times.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter were $1.794 billion, down from $2.226 billion in the same quarter of 2022. Net income was up slightly, from $48.2 million to $63.1 million.\n\nGameStop stock is wildly unpredictable. Retail investors pushed the stock price up 50% last month for unspecified reasons, but the company is already starting to give back the gains. GME stock is still down 9% for the year and was down 42% before its most recent rally.\n\nI expect it to return to its moribund ways. GME stock gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG) is a California company that offers help to students, including homework assistance, textbook rentals (both physical copies and digitally) and online tutoring.\n\nBut Chegg is facing some critical problems right now due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which is progressing to the point that free generative AI platforms are able to help students \u2014 and even do the work for them \u2014 for free.\n\n\u201cWe question if Chegg can build an AI experience that is meaningfully better than free alternatives that students will be willing to pay for [\u2026] Chegg has historically always beaten free competitors in the marketplace, but we believe the AI wave presents a truly credible free product experience to Chegg\u2019s paid subscription,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a research note.\n\nChegg is also making some changes at the top of its org chart, with Nathan Schultz taking over as CEO to succeed Dan Rosenweig, who is now executive chairman of the board of directors.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $174.4 million, down 7% from a year ago. Subscription services fell 9% to $154.1 million.\n\nCHGG stock is down 56% this year, including 31% in the last month. It gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are a lot of people who can\u2019t get through the day without a cup of coffee \u2014 or a whole pot. And Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) changed the industry when the Seattle-based coffeehouse swept across the country in the 1990s.\n\nBut after Starbucks posted a revenue and EPS miss in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, is it fair to wonder if people are getting tired of high-priced coffee drinks?\n\nComparable store sales fell by 3% in the U.S. and North America, and by 6% in international locations in the quarter. Overall, Starbucks reported revenue of $8.53 billion, down nearly 2% from a year ago.\n\nA major challenge for Starbucks is its ambitions in China. Luckin Coffee (OTCMTKS:LKNCY) passed Starbucks as the top coffeehouse in China last year and maintains an aggressive pricing plan that undercuts Starbucks.\n\nNot surprisingly, Starbucks stock is down 23% this year with most of those losses coming after the company\u2019s Q2 earnings report. Starbucks has its work cut out for it, and there\u2019s no need for investors to hold on while hoping for a turnaround.\n\nSBUX stock gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt may be fair to say that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a victim of its own success. The company was wildly successful in the last few years as it was one of the first to create and market a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThat success brought in billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nBut because people aren\u2019t getting vaccinated against Covid-19 as often as they were a year or two ago, Pfizer is facing some extremely challenging comparable numbers as it reports earnings.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $14.8 billion, down from $18.4 billion a year ago. Pfizer reported income of $4.6 billion and 82 cents per share, but that wasn\u2019t as good as a year ago when it reported $7 billion in income and $1.23 per share.\n\nPfizer issued full-year guidance for revenue between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion, and adjusted EPS of $2.15 to $2.35. Pfizer says that it expects to get $8 billion in combined revenue this year from its Covid-19 vaccinations, with the majority of that coming in the second half of the year.\n\nPFE stock is one to watch for a turnaround, but we aren\u2019t there yet. The stock is down 2% in 2024 and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "You\u2019ll get no argument from me that GameStop (NYSE:GME) is one of the best meme stocks to sell. However, the video game retailer has been around a long time, suggesting it\u2019s not the worst of the meme stocks to sell.\n\nSo who is?\n\nQuiverQuant.com provides data on the top meme stocks in U.S. stock exchanges. One of its data points is the WallStreetBets score, based on the number of times a company is mentioned on the subreddit over the past week.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop has a 95 rating out of 100, which is quite high. Eight others have scores higher than 95. Those would be good candidates for meme stocks to sell.\n\nThere are other stocks with lower scores that I would sell in a heartbeat, such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which clocks in at 94. I won\u2019t select it because I\u2019m tired of getting emails from AMC bulls complaining about my lack of objectivity.

Many investors may not be familiar with it, but it has a $6.1 billion market capitalization.\n\n\u201cImmunityBio is a vertically integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases,\u201d states the company\u2019s investor relations site,\u201d the company\u2019s investor relations site states.\n\nDr. Patrick Soon-Shiong founded ImmunityBio in 2014. He is the Executive Chairman and owns nearly 83% of the company through various affiliated businesses. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he\u2019s worth $12.6 billion, up $2.1 billion in 2024.\n\nIf he\u2019s as good at running a biotech firm as a newspaper \u2014 he bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million \u2014 you don\u2019t want anything to do with ImmunityBio.\n\nOne benefit of owning the largest paper on the West Coast is that it gets to announce ImmunityBio news. On April 22, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved Antika, the company\u2019s treatment for bladder cancer. As a result, Antika\u2019s shares are up 70% over the past month.\n\nWhile good news, it will have to sell a lot of Antika to eliminate the nearly $3 billion accumulated deficit on its balance sheet.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has a WallStreetBets score of 96.\n\nThere was a time when I thought Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor\u2019s strategy of buying Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for his data analytics software business\u2019s balance sheet wasn\u2019t a terrible idea.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Saylor started buying BTC in August 2020, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Funds Effective Rate, or FRED, was 0.10%. Today, it\u2019s 5.33%. With cash balances delivering negligible income, it couldn\u2019t hurt to put excess cash into an appreciating asset. Bitcoin at the time was $11,670. Today, it\u2019s over $58,000.\n\nThe company reported its Q1 2024 results on April 29. They missed on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares fell nearly 10% on the news.\n\nIn February, I argued that MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t a good data analytics stock because Bitcoin obscured its operating business, which isn\u2019t a high-growth enterprise. Its software-related revenue fell 5.5% in the first quarter to $115.2 million.\n\nThe problem is that it went from an operating loss of $20.3 million in Q1 2023 to a $203.7 million loss in the latest quarter. This was because of Bitcoin losses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nUnlike Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), which provides investors with a lower-risk way of owning Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), MicroStrategy does not do the same for Bitcoin.\n\nIf you want to own the cryptocurrency, buy it directly or purchase one of the many Bitcoin trusts.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage. CFVI\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RMBL) has a WallStreetBets score of 63, well below GameStop\u2019s 95 score. I picked Rumble because it\u2019s another example of misguided loyalty to all things Donald Trump.\n\nThe good news if you bought RUM stock at the beginning of the year is that you\u2019re up more than 55% year-to-date. The bad news is this is about as good as it will get. The stock got as high as $18.52 in February 2022. It remains well down from its 2022 highs despite this year\u2019s gains.\n\nThe gains in 2024 are two-fold: First, the same people gobbling up Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) stock also buy Rumble because of its video partnership with Truth Social, TMTG\u2019s social media platform. Secondly, it signed a partnership with Barstool Sports that puts all of Barstool Sports\u2019 content on the Rumble platform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about Rumble\u2019s commitment to sports and broadening audiences,\u201d said Dave Portnoy, Founder of Barstool Sports. \u201cWith the power of Barstool Sports, we are going to help Rumble be the top player in the video, cloud, and livestreaming space.\u201d\n\nIt all sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t pay the bills.\n\nIn 2023, Rumble generated $81 million, which is a heck of a lot more than Trump Media, but it was flat quarter to quarter while losing nearly $136 million in the past year, or $1.68 per dollar of sales, up from 91 cents per dollar of sales in 2022.\n\nDon\u2019t waste your money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Growth stocks are amazing choices for investors who are willing to take a little bit of added risk in the hopes that an innovative company will achieve above-average growth in revenue and earnings. But equally important is to identify growth stocks to sell should the ones in your portfolio aren\u2019t pulling their weight.\n\nGrowth stocks are popular because they are expanding fast \u2014 at least, the good ones are \u2014 and plugging their profits into growing their businesses even more. That\u2019s why many growth stocks don\u2019t offer dividends or buy back stock, because they are too busy scaling their businesses or expanding via mergers and acquisitions.\n\nGrowth stocks are also often out of whack with their fundamentals \u2014 and that\u2019s something to consider. It\u2019s not entirely unusual to see a growth stock with a high price-to-sales ratio or a price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe other side of the coin to growth stocks are value stocks, which typically are solid, consistent performers that trade at a lower price relative to their fundamentals, and often reward shareholders with dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIf you\u2019re holding a growth stock that isn\u2019t growing as much as it should, then you\u2019ve probably got a growth stock to sell on your hands.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader can be an ideal tool to help you identify the underperformers as it evaluates stocks based on growth, earnings performance, momentum and other factors.\n\nToday we\u2019ll look at some growth stocks to sell. Some of them have strong grades in the Portfolio Grader for growth \u2014 but all of them are underperformers with an overall disappointing grade. Those are the ones that you want be the most cautious with when considering what kind of growth stocks you want to have in your holdings.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to really consider AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) a growth stock, but if it is, it\u2019s certainly among the growth stocks to sell. It\u2019s more of a meme stock to me because it was one of those that gained in popularity when retail investors decided to jump into it, GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a few others.\n\nOn top of that, this is a growth stock that\u2019s not growing. While revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, up from $990 million, AMC could not hold on to that momentum.\n\nPreliminary Q1 figures show that AMC plans to post revenue of $951.4 million, a drop from $954.4 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAMC is also expected to post a loss of $163.5 million and 62 cents per share, versus a loss of $235.5 million and $1.71 per share a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC has a debt problem of $4.6 billion that continues to weigh on the company. Some lenders are seeking an extension on that debt payment, but that\u2019s not enough to make me change my mind about AMC stock.\n\nAMC stock is down 51% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth but an \u201cF\u201d rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMagna International (MGA) A Magna International (MGA) sign is on the front of a Magna building in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMagna International (NYSE:MGA) can do it all with automobiles. The Canadian company can do bodywork, power train modules, electrical systems and interiors. It can even manufacture complete vehicles.\n\nThe company has a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) to develop a business-to-business platform called SDVerse that would serve as a matchmaking platform for buyers and sellers of embedded automotive software.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the downside. Magna also has a relationship with Fisker (OTCMKTS:FSRN), a struggling electric vehicle company that is just trying to stay out of bankruptcy at this point.\n\nEvercore ISI downgraded MGA stock specifically because of the threat that Fisker poses to Magna\u2019s bottom line.\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter were $10.4 billion, up from $9.5 billion a year ago. An EPS of 94 cents was better than the 33 cents per share that Magna earned in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile the earnings performance is OK, Fisker\u2019s threat appears to be priced in to the stock price these days. MGA stock is down 18% this year and it gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NASDAQ:BB) made its mark as a maker of smartphones \u2014 it was one of the first devices in which you could get your email, and it was known for having a full keyboard on the device itself \u2014 which made for very small buttons.\n\nBut as other smartphone companies came along with better products that offered customer-pleasing apps and touch screen input, BlackBerry moved away from smartphones and to a software and services company.\n\nIt currently provides mobile device management, cybersecurity and software for autonomous vehicles.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $173 million, down from $175 million a year ago. The company posted loss of $56 million and 10 cents per share for the quarter, which was an improvement from its loss of $495 million and 85 cents per share from the same quarter a year ago.\n\nBB stock is down 19% this year, which is why I see it as one of the growth stocks to sell. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBoeing (BA) Royal Air Force Boeing (BA) Chinook HC2A (352) [ZH895] lifting off from runway\n\nSource: InsectWorld / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat is there to say about Boeing (NYSE:BA)? There\u2019s not much positive to say for this blue-chip company that is having a horrendous year.\n\nThe maker of the Boeing 737 Max 9 passenger jet is under tremendous pressure ever since the rear door flue off a jet while in midflight.\n\nFederal investigators grounded the entire fleet for inspection and two airlines reported finding loose screws on their aircraft.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have both been critical of Boeing, and with good reason.\n\nSeveral online tools have popped up in response, showing passengers how to avoid getting on 737 Max when booking their flights.\n\nNone of this is publicity that will help Boeing or BA stock. Boeing is one of the worst performers this year in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe stock is down 32% this year and earns a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square (SQ) logo displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is a technology computer software company. Besides owning the hardware that allows people to process credit card transactions from a smartphone or tablet.\n\nBlock also operates the CashApp finance platform, which is used as an alternative to traditional banks.\n\nIn addition, Block has a significant investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD), owning over 8,000 of the digital currency.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin jumped 69% in 2024, Block realized $207 million in earnings from its Bitcoin holdings in the fourth quarter of 2023. That\u2019s a huge percentage of the company\u2019s overall $562 million in quarterly revenue.\n\nSo yes, Block is making money. But I\u2019m also concerned that it\u2019s overly reliant on the Bitcoin price to do so. Bitcoin is down 10% in the last month and that doesn\u2019t bode well for SQ earnings when it next reports.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise was the only reason Block registered a profit for the 2023 fiscal year. It needs to find another way to profit should Bitcoin continue to slide in 2024.\n\nSQ stock is down 11% in 2024. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too long ago that MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) carried an \u201cA\u201d grade in the Portfolio Grader, but time has not treated the e-commerce company favorably. This is a prime example of why it\u2019s important to review your portfolio regularly.\n\nMercadoLibre operates an e-commerce and digital marketplace. Not only does it handle over 21% of all e-commerce sales in Latin America, but it serves as a payment processor for people who don\u2019t want to use a traditional bank.\n\nHowever, MELI looks like it\u2019s turning things around. First-quarter earnings reported May 2 showed net revenues up 36% from a year ago, and net income up 90%.\n\nMELI stock is down 6% in 2024, though that may be changing as the stock is up 3.6% in after-hours trading after reporting earnings on Thursday afternoon. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall grade in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLamb Weston (LV) Louis Vuitton storefront featuring an LV handbag. LVMUY stock.\n\nSource: Vietnam stock photos / Shutterstock\n\nLamb Weston (NYSE:LW) is an Idaho-based food processor that specializes in potato products. Whether you\u2019re dealing with sweet potatoes, french fries, tater tots, mashed potatoes or shredded potatoes \u2014 Lamb Weston has you covered.\n\nThe company has been expanding its reach outside of the U.S. by expanding its capacity at plants in Argentina and the Netherlands and building another facility in China.\n\nAs a growth stock, I see the wisdom in plowing money back into the business to reach more customers.\n\nBut is this working? In North America, the company reported that sales volume was down by 8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 because of the transition to a new enterprise resources planning system that reduced the visibility of inventory at distribution centers \u2014 leaving the company unable to fulfill orders.\n\nThat\u2019s a painful problem because Lamb Western had the product but couldn\u2019t sell it \u2014 and it potentially hurt its relationships with those disappointed customers.\n\nLW stock is down 22% in 2024 and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall grade in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in\u00a0LW.

        "title": "Discount Alert! 7 Hot Stocks Heading for the Clearance Rack.",
        "content": "With the market encountering significant challenges, now may be the time to consider stocks on sale. While it\u2019s always a sweaty-palm affair to buy into the red ink, doing so may give the speculator significant upside.\n\nAs the adage goes, be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. The best part about getting hot stocks on discount is that they should still remain fundamentally sound. Basically, the only difference is the underlying market cycle.\n\nGranted, no guarantees exist \u2013 sometimes securities sell off for a good reason. Still, these intriguing ideas might be worth a second look. With that, here are some stocks on sale to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot too long ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nike (NYSE:NKE) CEO John Donahoe led a virtual all-hands meeting in late February. During the meeting, he announced that the athletic footwear and apparel giant wasn\u2019t performing to its lofty standards. Further, he held himself accountable. And by that, the message was that more than 1,600 employees would need to lose their jobs.\n\nNobody said the corporate world was easy or fair. Still, Nike now states that it\u2019s refocusing to once again deliver innovative footwear. To be blunt, corporate executives usually say the same thing when faced with challenges. Nevertheless, Nike has a massive advantage that other companies lack: global brand presence and power.\n\nIf Nike makes the tweaks, the moves should resonate with its customers. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that NKE is objectively undervalued. It does trade at 2.81X trailing-year sales, which is above the sector median 0.85X. Still, if management hits the right notes, the projected high-side revenue for fiscal 2025 \u2013 which stands at $54.5 billion \u2013 could arrive sooner than expected.\n\nComcast (CMCSA) Keeping NBC News on the Air Could Hamper Comcast Stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) represents a challenging idea among stocks on sale. Naturally, the entertainment landscape is a difficult one for all players. For example, cineplex operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has struggled for traction as it faces a declining box office.\n\nStill, Comcast also has the opportunity to focus on action-adventure blockbusters for major releases. Such films are usually best experienced on the big screen. Further, the company could also take advantage of the post-pandemic travel cycle with its theme parks. Sure, revenge travel may no longer be the phenomenon that it once was. However, travel prioritization remains a strong pull among consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne advantage that Comcast offers with its red-stained price tag is a more attractive valuation. Currently, shares trade at 9.07X forward earnings, below the sector median 13.59X. In fiscal 2024, analysts project Comcast\u2019s earnings per share to reach $4.22, above last year\u2019s print of $3.98. So, it makes an intriguing case for stocks on sale.\n\nGlobalFoundries (GFS) In this photo illustration GlobalFoundries (GFS) Inc. logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) is a powerfully relevant idea among stocks on sale. Per its public profile, GlobalFoundries manufactures integrated circuits (ICs) on wafers designed for various markets, including smart mobile devices, automotive, aerospace and defense, among many others.\n\nWith the memory of the Covid-19-related supply pressures still fresh, GlobalFoundries benefits from a strong narrative. However, the current economic headwinds pose obstacles for GFS stock. As such, the market isn\u2019t exactly enthused with the idea. However, this dynamic also means that shares are trading at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.67X. That\u2019s well lower than the sector median 1.6X.\n\nNow, part of the hesitation is that analysts on average are projecting fiscal 2024 sales to fall to $6.8 billion. Last year, the company posted sales of $7.39 billion. However, the optimistic target calls for $8.62 billion. And if the bulls win out, fiscal 2025 revenue could jump to $10.54 billion. For speculators, GFS could be one of the stocks on sale.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nWhile there\u2019s so much talk about artificial intelligence, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) hasn\u2019t been a beneficiary, far from it. BIDU\u2019s performances for the trailing year and year-to-date have been disappointing. At the same time, the skepticism is understandable. Baidu is based in China and the Chinese economy faces nagging questions concerning its viability.\n\nNevertheless, speculators who are seeking stocks on sale may want to keep BIDU on their radar. As Baidu\u2019s management team mentioned, it\u2019s gaining traction with its artificial intelligence (AI) business. Further, it\u2019s a consistently profitable enterprise with a robust net margin of 15.1%. Even so, shares trade at a lowly 9.95X forward earnings. Should China\u2019s economy show signs of gradual improvement, BIDU could be poised to recover\n\nWhat\u2019s really intriguing is that Baidu, currently trading at 1.89X trailing-year sales, could see its revenue jump to $21.13 billion in fiscal 2024. Also, the most optimistic projections call for sales of $23.51 billion in fiscal 2025. That would imply that BIDU may also be discounted relative to the top line.\n\nBritish American Tobacco (BTI) British American Tobacco logo on a building\n\nSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) might not seem like a natural candidate for hot stocks on sale. For one thing, its 52-week performance is anything but hot. As for the business, the idea that tobacco is cool faded a long time ago. Indeed, anti-tobacco advocates have done an excellent job of reducing the global smoking prevalence rate.\n\nSo, why bother with BTI? Fundamentally, the company offers a valuable product. Again, while smoking has lost much of its luster, it remains a popular activity. Plus, not all countries have seen a reduction in prevalence. More importantly to the bottom line, smokers have gravitated toward e-cigarettes and similar alternative products such as heat-not-burn devices.\n\nThis is where British American Tobacco can assert itself because traditional tobacco companies can better replicate the analog experience via the \u201cdigital\u201d format. Also, BTI brings great value, trading at a forward earnings multiple of 6.59X, lower than 90.91% of its peers. Combined with a forward dividend yield of 10.16%, it makes for an enticing idea.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nA dating app that aimed to change the way people think about relationships, Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) started off with much promise. Its selling point was that for traditionally oriented relationships, women had to make the first move. This directive was designed to implement parity in relational power structures. However, it also impacted Bumble\u2019s viability.\n\nWhat it basically boils down to is that male users must wait to be contacted. That could be very frustrating as such apps don\u2019t abide by a democratic process. In other words, a few \u201cprospects\u201d will get the lion\u2019s share of the attention. Everybody else will get the crumbs, if anything. And that\u2019s just going to cause male users to seek other platforms.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m somewhat optimistic about Bumble\u2019s new CEO, Lidiane Jones. With a few simple tweaks, BMBL could rise to the top by being more gentlemen friendly. Should the execution follow through, the company could potentially hit its high-end sales target of $1.16 billion. Therefore, it could be one of the stocks on sale.\n\nChewy (CHWY) The Chewy logo on a banner at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn online retailer of pet food and other pet-related products, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) appears to enjoy a double-pronged weapon. First, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales has been marching steadily higher since the second quarter of 2022. Notably, this trend materialized even with inflation and high borrowing costs impeding consumer sentiment.\n\nSecond, Americans love spending on their pets. In 2023, total pet industry expenditures in this country hit $147 billion. That\u2019s up noticeably from the prior year\u2019s print of $136.8 billion. Further, analysts still project growth, with this year\u2019s sales potentially reaching $150.6 billion. By logical deduction, Chewy should perform well.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s quite the opposite \u2013 CHWY is a big laggard. Still, with consumers demonstrating year after year that they prioritize the care of their furry friends, it may be time for a rethink. Analysts believe that the current fiscal year should see high-side revenue of $12.48 billion. That\u2019s very reasonable given the backdrop, making CHWY one of the stocks on sale.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most popular retail investor stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to how retail trading has changed over these past couple of years and some recent trends, then you can check out 5 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is quite different from the one present at the turn of the millennium. This is because the internet and consumer technology have made vast sums of information available to anyone willing to learn. As a result, more people are able to invest in the stock market, and this trend soared during the coronavirus pandemic. While the pandemic is known for the devastating disease and the lock downs, at the same time, it also put retail investors for the first time on Wall Street's map. This happened through the meme stock mania, which saw popular companies GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) soar on the stock market as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the shares in bulk.\n\nThe rise of retail investors has also introduced a new angle to investing. Professional investors, like hedge funds, only have one objective in mind when making their decisions. This is profit maximization, whether the shares are bought long, sold short, or held to force a change at the firm as is with activist investing. On the flip side, retail investors, while also naturally influenced by the profit motive, also invest in stocks that they like. For instance, hedge funds had sold GameStop short and negatively influenced its share price because they remained unconvinced about the traditional brick and mortar retailer's ability to compete in the digital new world dominated by virtual video game downloads offered by platforms run by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). The retail camp, on the other hand, had also invested in GameStop because of their attachment to the brand.\n\n2024 is seeing this bifurcation between retail and professional investors surface once again. One of the hottest, and most volatile, stocks this year has been Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT). Like GameStop before it, DJT's investors also have a personal motive for piling into the shares. Retail investors have invested in the stock because they trust the former US President, and have continued to hold the shares even though TMTG battles short sellers. TMTG is a social media company that operates Truth Social, a platform President Trump set up after he was banned from Twitter (now X) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Facebook. With the US Presidential race for 2024 having kicked off, investors are also battling it out on Wall Street as TMTG stock rises and falls. DJT - the stock - is quite fresh as it commenced trading just earlier this year. Before the merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) and TMTG, the shares had traded under DWAC and had become a proxy for the former President's daily affairs. Soon after its merger, TMTG shared with investors that it had earned $4 million in income from ads run on its platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock DJT is up 138% year to date, entering the year after TMTG sued press outlets for incorrectly interpreting its financial statements. The fireworks in its share price are also recent, as $DJT's predecessor stock, $DWAC, was flat throughout 2023. Like other special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), DWAC's stock also posted its strongest gains soon after the stock was listed for public trading. Back in October 2021, the stock stunned the market by soaring to $175 and settled to close at $94, the highest in its history. This marked a 1,500% price appreciation in the two trading days after news hit the wires that TMTG was merging with DWAC as the Trump team geared up to launch Truth Social. From its peak close of $94, the shares are down by 55%, after they narrowed the drop to 34% earlier this year after the merger and the ticker change to DJT.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most popular stocks among retail investors. A couple of notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024\n\nmichael-fortsch-SIz6izQKxzs-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most popular stocks among retail investors, we used data from the Robinhood Index, Fintel, and Vanda Research to make a list of all the stocks that ordinary traders can't get enough of.\n\nFor these popular retail investor stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "Most Entertainment Stocks Are Better Buys Than AMC: 3 Picks to Consider",
        "content": "Most entertainment stocks are considered better investments than AMC (NYSE:AMC)\u2014well, duh! We\u2019re talking about a stock that lost over 90% of its value last year and over 97% in the past decade. Additionally, it continues to deplete its cash reserves while grappling with a debt burden that pushes it close to bankruptcy. However, AMC is far from being an industry bellwether in 2024, with plenty of attractive picks in the entertainment sector.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting in the entertainment sector, though, with the rapid acceleration of streaming technologies impacting consumer preferences. Moreover, streaming has proved to be a remarkably resilient space despite inflation chipping away consumers\u2019 purchasing power. It is important, though, to separate the wheat from the chaff, making these entertainment stocks more attractive than others.\n\nEntertainment Stocks: Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s an excellent buy-the-dip opportunity in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u00a0stock at this time. Despite posting another handsome beat across both lines, streaming pioneer Netflix lost roughly 9% after earnings. The main reason for the drop is that Netflix will stop reporting subscriber numbers completely starting in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI feel as though the market is overreacting to the end of subscriber reporting and ignoring the bigger picture with Netflix. It added 9.33 million subscribers in Q1, taking its tally to 269.6 million subscribers, beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates by almost 48%. Moreover, sales were up 14.8% to $9.37 billion, while operating income shot up $2.6 billion, a\u00a053% jump from the prior-year period. On top of that, it expects to post 13% to 15% revenue growth in fiscal year 2024, with its management plans to continue increasing operating margins.\n\nOver the past year, the company has made notable strides through its belt-tightening measures and password-sharing crackdown. These measures have proven incredibly successful and will play a key role as Netflix sees its revenue evolving over the next few years.\n\nTKO Group Holdings (TKO) wwe stock WWE Monday Night Raw at 02 Arena. London\n\nSource: Tom Rose / Shutterstock.com\n\nTKO Group Holdings (NYSE:TKO) is arguably the hottest entertainment company\u00a0at this time. Surprisingly, TKO stock is outperforming the broader market, up almost 22% year-to-date (YTD) compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 20% gain.\u00a0This month, the discrepancy is more evident, where TKO is up 11% while the S&P 500\u2019s is in the negative.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has been on fire over the past few weeks following the colossal success of\u00a0WWE\u2019s\u00a0WrestleMania XL event, followed by UFC 300. Both events shattered multiple records, shedding light on the incredible combo of two of the largest entertainment intellectual properties in the WWE and UFC.\n\nThe combined entity will continue to reap the rewards through its diverse revenue streams, including media rights, event ticketing, and branded merchandise. Moreover, there are also plans to venture into new markets, such as online betting, positioning it for long-term growth. I believe TKO\u2019s media rights are still considerably undervalued and expected to increase significantly over time.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is another entertainment stock that blew it out of the park with its Q1 earnings print. It comfortably bested top-and-bottom-line estimates while reporting record profits. Its operational income of \u20ac168 million represented a 208% improvement from its prior loss of \u20ac156 million in Q1 2023. Moreover, its \u20ac3.64 billion sales were 20% higher than the figure it reported in the same period last year.\n\nThese stellar numbers indicate Spotify\u2019s pervasive influence in the music streaming\u00a0realm, boasting over 600 million monthly active users. Moreover, over the years, it has become a leading podcast platform, with partnerships with industry trailblazers such as Joe Rogan and investments in original content to enhance its user base. Another major factor in Spotify\u2019s success is that it continues to implement its \u201cefficiency\u201d strategy, which has significantly expanded its profitability in recent quarters. \u00a0That said, Spotify remains one of the best-streaming stocks in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Dump in April (Before They Become the Next AMC)",
        "content": "Volatility is rising in the stock market. Between the recent hot inflation data and mounting geopolitical tensions, investors are starting to reassess the broader economic environment.\n\nIt seems that the Federal Reserve might not come through with previously anticipated interest rate cuts. This, in turn, has the potential to greatly reduce the speculative juices in the stock market. Throw in some softness in leading AI stocks, and the market\u2019s red flags are mounting.\n\nInvestors should be repositioning their portfolios accordingly. Some of the companies at highest risk today are those that have weak fundamentals. Rather, their shares have found support primarily due to meme trading, short squeezes and other such exogenous factors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut the stock market\u2019s bull run is now in danger. It\u2019s time to throttle back risk exposure, making it an opportune moment to sell these three meme stocks before they utterly implode like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA) automobile dealership vending machine. Carvana is an online-only used car dealer.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarvana (NYSE:CVNA) has had a breathtaking run over the past year with this stock rising approximately 700%. Simply incredible stuff.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s scant little fundamental cause to justify a move of any such magnitude. Carvana, as a retailer with its unique car vending machines, has created a distinct marketplace for used cars. It also purchases used vehicles directly from individuals, sometimes at surprisingly high prices.\n\nIf operated judiciously, this business model might be a winner. But, the issue is that the firm is incredibly levered and barely profitable. In fact, it had to fight off bankruptcy concerns not too long ago. Carvana barely squeezed out a small profit last year despite an exceptionally favorable car market and elevated levels of consumer spending.\n\nGiven high interest rates and the potential for significantly declining consumer discretionary spending, it seems Carvana probably has already enjoyed the best market conditions it could hope for. If it couldn\u2019t squirrel away large profits when the sun was shining, a storm could devastate the firm. Things are likely to get worse from here, and analysts agree. They model Carvana falling back into loss-making territory this year. Furthermore, analysts expect Carvana to generate large losses in 2025 and 2026 as well.\n\nIn addition, the stock has been bolstered by a massive short squeeze. 32% of the float has been sold short and that\u2019s rocket fuel on the way up. But this factor could lead to an equally rapid descent when momentum runs in reverse.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American meat substitute company Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nYears ago, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) was a hot new IPO that sought to revolutionize the protein market. Many people thought plant-based burgers and sausages would be a serious competitive threat to traditional animal meats as time went on.\n\nThis is becoming increasingly less likely. Beyond Meat\u2019s partnerships with restaurants largely failed to move the needle. Sales at grocery stores have also declined as Beyond Meat has struggled to find traction outside of its dedicated, but small, vegan and vegetarian fanbase.\n\nSimply put, alternative proteins haven\u2019t found the right product, quality and price mix to garner significant market adoption from omnivores. Beyond Meat has always had massive overhead and low operating margins, resulting in the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars per year.\n\nThat was somewhat acceptable when revenues were rising and Beyond Meat could hope to reach operating scale and overcome its financial travails.\n\nNow, though, the bloom is off the rose. Beyond Meat\u2019s revenues plunged from $465 million in 2021 to just $343 million in 2023. Analysts expect another decline to $329 million in 2024.\n\nBYND stock soared on a short squeeze earlier this year, but it\u2019s already given back those gains, and there\u2019s little fundamental reason for optimism. Traders should look to exit this meme stock before it goes from bad to worse.\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) A Joby Aviation (JOBY Stock) air taxi on display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nJoby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) is a venture stage company attempting to commercialize electric vehicles for short range flights. The idea is that passengers can use Joby vehicles to get from an airport to a destination close to their house or office, for example.\n\nIn theory, this sort of electric vehicle could transform the urban taxi market, at least on certain popular high-volume routes. However, it remains to be seen if these sorts of vehicles will be more commercially viable than helicopters.\n\nNeedless to say, private helicopters services have existed for decades and remain a niche. It seems there simply aren\u2019t that many consumers that have the money or the willingness to pay for short range private flights.\n\nJoby and other eVTOL players are hoping that the electrification of the private aircraft will lead to adoption as it can address some noise and environmental concerns. But commercial proof of concept remains lacking. Additionally, short sellers have taken Joby to task citing concerns both on the cost of the vehicles and with eventual passenger demand.\n\nDespite having virtually no revenues and losing approximately $500 million per year, Joby retains a massive market capitalization. Simply put, a $3 billion market cap is a gigantic speculative bet on a company that may well not amount to much in the end. Put another way, traders should get out of JOBY stock before the broader economy turns downward and these sorts of highly speculative concept stocks totally implode.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "These stocks that are vulnerable to rate cuts won\u2019t be saved by a potential interest rate cut. Readers can take that statement one of two ways. It\u2019s either a reflection that rate cuts are now expected to occur later than previously expected, and that the firms will run out of time. Or, it implies that even if rate cuts are quickly enacted that it won\u2019t be enough to save these firms.\n\nI\u2019d suggest that in either case the firms discussed are not worthy of investment. Each stock has suffered in the face of continued quantitative tightening. However, each firm also has a unique variety of other factors which conspire to weaken their respective stocks.\n\nInvestors should not be lured in by suggestions of outsized gains on implied rebounds. Instead avoid these stocks that are vulnerable to rate cuts at all costs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC (NYSE:AMC) was one of the primary names during the Reddit meme stock era. That era is essentially over and what remains is the naked truth of its business.\n\nAMC operates movie theaters that are struggling to find their niche in the new digital era. people simply are not going out to the movies as often as they did in the past. The long-term trends continue to point to the continued emergence of other modes of watching movies.\n\nThe problem won\u2019t get any better for AMC in the immediate future. AMC posted $4.81 billion in sales during all of 2023. That figure is expected to shrink to $4.55 billion in 2024. Bullish investors could argue that AMC\u2019s EPS losses are narrowing over the same period in order to make an argument in favor of investing. However, AMC is expected to continue producing losses through at least 2026. It\u2019s all part and parcel of a larger narrative in which the movie theater industry continues to contract. That has been and will continue to be the primary reason to avoid AMC which is the largest theater chain in the U.S.\n\nMullen Automotive (MULN) In this photo illustration, the Mullen Technologies (MULN) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) continues to use naive investors to enrich its ownership. Those investors have become blind to the fact that the company has enacted three reverse stock splits over the last 12 months. They somehow continue to believe that the company will emerge as a legitimate EV truck and van manufacturer in the future.\n\nMullen shares themselves currently trade for approximately $4. However, that is simply a function of the arithmetic that governs stock splits. Most of the time investors understand that reverse stock splits are a desperate hail Mary to increase the value of share prices. The common result is that firms enacting reverse stock splits are usually punished. Yet, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with Mullen Automotive which should trade for mere pennies by now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral of my colleagues have noted that the company continues to enrich its ownership. This is happening despite the horrendous underlying business. Do not reward Mullen Automotive\u2019s ownership with your capital. It will not be utilized to enact a turnaround. Instead it will line the pockets of a CEO steering the company into oblivion.\n\nVornado Realty (VNO) Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room. commercial real estate\n\nSource: GaudiLab / Shutterstock\n\nVornado Realty (NYSE:VNO) is a large commercial real estate firm and precisely the kind of stock that suffers as interest rates rise.\n\nCommercial real estate continues to face severe headwinds due to the emergence of remote and hybrid work models. The problem is particularly acute for Vornado Realty which is focused on office properties.\n\nOccupancy rates have rebounded to a degree but remote work is here to stay. firms like tornado Realty cannot remain stuck in the past because that past doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\n\nThat\u2019s only one problem for the firm. Its holdings are concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. Cheaper options have emerged making New York City less attractive than it was before.\n\nThe company is also plagued by a troubled dividend that has shrunk by 19% annually over the past 5 years. Beyond that, the firm is also clearly in distress based on multiple metrics including its Altman-Z score which measures bankruptcy risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "12 Best All-Time Low Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best all time low stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news and what might happen later this year, then you can skip ahead and take a look at the 5 Best All-Time Stocks\u00a0 To Invest In.\n\nAfter a rather devastating 2022 that must have made countless hedge fund managers either lose their hair or see it turn gray, the stock market of Q2 2024 is a markedly different environment. 2022 was the year a significant paradigm shift took place. This came in the form of multiple 75 basis point interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve - a decision that pulled the rug out from below investors' feet even though the warning bells for a rate hike had been ringing since the previous year. Higher interest rates mean that hedge funds find it considerably difficult to raise capital for their risky bets, and high growth stocks also set new all time low records as the broader market becomes wary of their ability to raise capital for growth and fund their daily business operations.\n\nFor instance, while its shares didn't set an all time low as too much easy money had already flown into the stock market by then, 2022 was one of the worst years in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s history. Its shares dipped to below $91 in November 2022 as they effectively reversed all gains made since mid 2015. Similarly, the stock of Elon Musk's Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reversed all gains made since the firm had convinced investors that mass producing an electric vehicle was not simply a paper plan but could be grounded in reality.\n\nSince then, the market has changed. Mark Zuckerberg's net worth almost touched $187 billion in April 2024, making him richer than Musk as the stock market continues to reward Meta's stock for Zuckerberg's well-articulated plans for artificial intelligence, a surprise dividend, and robust earnings performance. Musk, on the other hand, has suffered from a worsening electric vehicle industry hampered by high inflation and a glut in the lithium industry, saw another hit to his net worth in April 2024 after a Reuters report claimed that Tesla had scrapped plans for its highly hyped low-cost EV. This report was also the perfect illustration of the fickle and fast paced nature of today's stock market, as while the stock tanked by 5% in the immediate aftermath of the report, it recovered nearly all these losses during the same trading day after Musk's denial.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile these big ticket names have not set new all time lows, there are some stocks that have touched these levels over the course of the last 12 months despite the market's AI euphoria. One such all time low stock that you might recognize belongs to the iconic American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC). AMC, for those unfortunate enough to be out of the loop, was a meme stock that soared by a whopping 490% between April and mid June 2021 in the midst of the meme stock mania of the coronavirus pandemic and is now down 51% year to date and a couple of cents above its all time low share price. Seems like Warren Buffett was right when he said to be fearful when others are greedy, and those who still believed in AMC at the turn of 2024 were surely in for a rude awakening.\n\nAnother all time low stock making the news these days is the premium electric vehicle manufacturer and designer Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID). Operating in the electric vehicle industry is not for the faint of heart right now, and the problems of high inflation, low demand, and a glut are multiplied tenfold for a firm that focuses exclusively on selling expensive and premium cars. Lucid's shares are down by 34.58% year to date, and here's what the firm's management had to say during its latest earnings call:\n\nIn 2023, we made headway with our cost optimization programs, the key strategic priority for the company. We found success in areas, including freight, logistics, overhead and bill of materials. For example, we activated logistics as a part of the Phase II build-out of our Arizona factory, AMP 1, allowing us to bring the vast majority of vehicle components under the same roof as general assembly.\n\nThis enabled us to realize savings from the reduction in overhead, transportation and complexity as well as better efficiency. From an inventory perspective, we drew down raw material inventory levels by high teens percent from the start of Q4 through material planning and inventory management improvements. Improvements in focus accuracy, in particular, allowed us to reduce inventory resulted in savings related to logistics and material handling labor, equipment rentals and storage cost. We also experienced a significant reduction in freight from more efficient transportation and storage planning. For vehicle direct costs, we implemented a number of initiatives that resulted in certain bill of materials cost savings, some of which is directly related to our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nWe have identified additional opportunities in cost of goods sold as well as operating expenses that we will look to operationalize over the course of 2024.\n\nSo, with these details in mind, we decided to take a look at some all time low stocks that hedge funds have bought. A couple of notable picks are Klaviyo, Inc. (NYSE:KVYO), Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAGE), and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC). 12 Best All-Time Low Stocks To Invest In\n\nA trader on the floor of a bustling stock exchange, surrounded by a sea of monitors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best all time low stocks, we ranked stocks whose shares are below 5.5% above their all time lows by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023. Only stocks with a market capitalization greater than $300 million were chosen.\n\nFor these best all time low stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best All-Time Low Stocks To Invest In\n\n12. VinFast Auto Ltd.

        "title": "7 Meme Stocks to Sell in April Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "There are seven meme stocks to sell in April before the worst comes to worst. Meme stocks are often driven by hype and social media frenzy rather than fundamental business factors, can be incredibly volatile and unpredictable. While the potential for big gains can be enticing, the risks involved shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nThese stocks can experience sudden and dramatic price swings, fueled by the whims of retail investors rather than the company\u2019s actual performance. This makes it extremely difficult to predict when the bubble might burst, leaving investors vulnerable to significant losses.\n\nHowever, not all meme stocks are created equal; some are more risky than others. Therefore, in order for investors to protect their portfolios against volatility, i\u2019ve selected seven meme stocks to sell for this article that one should carefully consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are seven meme stocks to sell before it\u2019s too late. Don\u2019t get caught up in the hype or Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) at the expense of your portfolio.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) has been a hallmark name in the meme stock frenzy. It minted millionaires, but many more have lost money buying 0DTE calls, trying to cash in on the apparent war against the hedge funds and other institutions.\n\nGranted, there has been some impressive growth in tangible book value and levered free cash flow over the past three years, but analysts also anticipate a revenue decrease of 11.8% year over year to $1.09 billion for the first quarter ending April 2024.\n\nFurthermore, GME\u2019s current ratio and quick ratio suggest a strong liquidity position, although its return on equity and assets indicates less favorable performance compared to industry standards\u200b.\n\nThe sell thesis for GME is this: The GME bandwagon has subsided considerably, as I believe that the reality of GME\u2019s continually shrinking main line of business is starting to hit home for many.\n\nGME\u2019s 30-day historical volatility has steadily decreased since its peak in 2021, which suggests a diminished risk appetite among retail investors who once pumped its high flucuations.\n\nFurthermore, GME\u2019s 30-day implied volatility peaked this year near the start of March, reaching levels unseen for many years.\n\nIt should be noted that during this spike of implied volatility, an influx of put options were purchased as well, with open interest reaching 0.93 on the put-call ratio.\n\nIn my view, it\u2019s hard to classify GME as having meme investors\u2019 backing when historical and especially implied volatility has been declining to a significant degree and consistently over time. If the options market (which includes bears) is pricing in lower future volatility over time, then it suggests a stabilization in expectations from both bulls and bears. This stabilization implies that the market forsees fewer extreme swings in GME\u2019s price, aligning more with fundamental trading than speculative bursts via social media trends or coordinated buying, which defines meme stock investing in the first place.\n\nStory continues\n\nI don\u2019t see a way forward for GME, so it\u2019s then one of those meme stocks to sell.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) experienced a notable decline from its peak stock price, facing challenges in ramping up production and maintaining investor enthusiasm.\n\nRIVN projected a production target of 57,000 vehicles for 2024, following its performance in the first quarter where it produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588. The company also reported a net loss of $5,432 million, an improvement from the previous year\u2019s $6,752 million. Its gross profit also saw improvement, with a loss of $2,030 million in 2023 compared to a loss of $3,123 million in 2022.\n\nHowever, despite these improvements, in the same year, it had capital expenditures of $1,026 million, and ongoing need for substantial investment to scale production capabilities and develop new models.\n\nI feel that the need for additional capital is a serious risk, as it could lead to share dilution for investors or substantially add to its financial risk via debt financing, which makes it one of those meme stocks to sell.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) In this photo illustration the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) is a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company that\u2019s seen significant interest from investors due to the cryptocurrency market\u2019s volatility and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will occur in under two weeks at the time of writing.\n\nI don\u2019t generally suggest that investors should buy Bitcoin mining company stocks as they are risky investments. As the blockchain reward halves for Bitcoin, companies like MARA are under increasing pressure to maintain their margins, which then puts pressure on Bitcoin to increase in price to maintain stability.\n\nAnalysts project a final loss in 2023 with positive profits of $61 million expected in 2024, underpinned by an estimated average annual growth rate of 119%.\n\nThe company specific-risk for MARA is that its strongly-invested in the Bitcoin mining industry and lacks diversification into other operating segments. It has one of the strongest hash rates in the industry at 24.7 in 2023, making it overly concentrated compared to its peers.\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO), a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, has faced corrections due to concerns over its operating losses and the sustainability of its vehicle delivery growth\u200b.\n\nAnalysts highlight concerns over declining electric vehicle deliveries and market share in China, pointing towards a challenging outlook for NIO. Furthermore, the company\u2019s Q4 results showed margin contraction and widening losses, indicating the hurdles it faces in maintaining its growth trajectory and achieving profitability.\n\nNIO is a meme stock that has also lost its appeal as the one to watch for the weak, and further risks of capital depreciation I feel are very real. It has already lost 47.96% of its value over the past year, and it seems likely that it will drop further due to the structural weaknesses in China and its shaky fundamentals. I therefore recommend that investors steer clear of NIO, and also designate it as one of those meme stocks to sell.\n\nPolestar Automotive (PSNY) A Polestar (PSNY) sign at the area at Polestar powerstop in Mj\u00f6lby.\n\nSource: Jeppe Gustafsson / Shutterstock.com\n\nPolestar Automotive (NASDAQ:PSNY) has drawn attention in the electric vehicle space but faces challenges in maintaining its stock value. Highlighting this, its share has dropped 83.09% in value over the past five years.\n\nPSNY recently secured $950 million in external funding, which marks a new phase for the company. This is expected to be more significant in the second half of the year as their SUVs reach full production and distribution.\n\nHowever, some cracks in the thesis start to appear when one examines PSNY\u2019s financials. For instance, it has almost three times as much debt as cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, and had a negative cash flow of $1.8 billion over the past twelve months. More funding is needed for it to continue its operations, and this could very well come as a mix of both an equity raise and a raise through additional debt, which puts even more stress on the company.\n\nLyft (LYFT) The Lyft (LYFT) logo on the side of a pink car parked on a street.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nLyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is adapting to a post-pandemic world, focusing on profitability. However, it remains to be seen if these efforts can sustain its meme stock status\u200b.\n\nThe company has had negative accounting profits over the last twelve months. However, in the future, it\u2019s expected to reach profitability, but this comes at a steep price. Its forward P/E ratio is 35 times earnings, which is much higher than the median of its peer companies that also operate in the ride hailing market.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, LYFT anticipates gross bookings of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion for Q1\u201924, with an Adjusted EBITDA of $50 million to $55 million. The full year\u2019s directional guidance suggests mid-teen year-over-year growth in rides.\n\nHowever, this does not change the fact that its shares could still be perceived as overvalued, especially when one considers that it\u2019s revenue is only expected to climb 12.33% next year and is already at 5.23 billion at the time of writing. It hasn\u2019t managed to grow its bottom line despite its robust revenue growth, and I\u2019m doubtful this will change in the foreseeable future.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Mobile phone with logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC). Pumping stock exchange prices by Reddit investors. Playing on market, manipulation. Losses, crisis.\n\nSource: Ira Lichi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) became synonymous with meme stock rallies during the pandemic. Those days are long over, and traders looking to pump enthusiasm into this stock will end up getting burned sooner or later.\n\nFor 2024, AMC is expected to see a revenue increase, going from $4.55 billion in 2023 to a projected $5.26 billion. This optimistic revenue forecast suggests a rebound, including a forecasted increase in EPS from -1.63 to -0.81, indicating an improvement in losses. Analyst consensus on AMC\u2019s stock leans towards a \u201cSell\u201d rating, and I think this should not be taken lightly.\n\nAMC\u2019s issues are the same as GME\u2019s; futile attempts at pivoting to a world and consumer preferences that no longer support its core business model. This kind of pessimism is well-deserved given its lack of a constructive track record, and is therefore one of those meme stocks to sell as well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "An underappreciated part of investing is knowing when to cut your losses. No one bats a thousand in this field; even the best investors make some bad picks and come up with ideas that don\u2019t pan out from time to time.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to get a pick wrong. It\u2019s quite another thing to stay wrong. Further to that, there\u2019s no reason to be loyal to a stock just because you already own it. In fact, investors should pay special attention to make sure they don\u2019t fall prey to sunk cost fallacy.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to dump a bad investment and reallocate the funds to a more promising opportunity. These are seven struggling stocks to avoid; investors should dump these companies now before things go from bad to worse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) was one of the most improbable stock market events of the past decade. Shares rose as much as 100-fold from the lows during its historic short squeeze. The event became so famous that a documentary was made about it. Several hedge funds lost large sums of money betting against the company, further adding to the drama.\n\nStripped of the magic, however, there is a little to recommend GameStop as an investment in the year 2024.\n\nThe company continues to post poor operating results. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising as more and more of the gaming industry goes to digital rather than physical distribution means. GameStop\u2019s other efforts such as selling collectibles and its prior cell phone venture also failed to turn around the firm\u2019s prospects. The future looks especially bleak as game developers increasingly stop selling games on physical discs altogether.\n\nGameStop shares have slumped in 2024 is it becomes increasingly clear that there will be no comeback for the firm\u2019s operating business. Traders should exit their GameStop shares before they lose what\u2019s left of the remaining value.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf GameStop was the original meme stock, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was not far behind. Traders piled into AMC shares back in 2021 in hopes of turning around the struggling movie theater chain. Advocates hoped to set off what they called the mother of all short squeezes.\n\nAnd credit where it\u2019s due, a huge short squeeze did occur. AMC rose from a (split-adjusted) low of $10 up to nearly $400 at its ultimate peak. But that period has long since passed, and shares are now down 99% from the highs.\n\nAMC leadership was not able to capitalize on the hype and interest around the company. The management team has made questionable decisions, such as investing in a gold mining company which had no apparent connection to AMC\u2019s core movie business.\n\nStory continues\n\nBox office attendance remains down versus pre-pandemic levels. And AMC doesn\u2019t have much time to turn things around. AMC\u2019s balance sheet is troubled, with the firm having a sharply negative book value per share. This indicates that the stock would be effectively worthless if the company wound down operations today.\n\nGiven its huge debt load and poor operating results, AMC seems likely to continue sinking further into penny stock territory.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBack during the 2021 SPAC boom, traders were willing to give almost anything a shot. Even some frankly out of this world ideas. That includes Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE).\n\nRichard Branson\u2019s company seeks to popularize a form of space tourism. We\u2019re not talking about going to Mars here, but rather reaching orbit just long enough to enjoy a brief zero gravity flight experience.\n\nIn theory, there may be demand for this sort of trip although short sellers have suggested otherwise. They claim the marketing and hype went well ahead of what potential customers could reasonably expect to receive on a Virgin Galactic voyage.\n\nIn any case, years after the business has tried to reach commercial stage, things are still not up and running to a meaningful degree. The company generated just $6.8 million of revenue in 2023. Analysts actually forecast that top-line number dropping to an even lower figure in 2024 and 2025.\n\nWithout any meaningful volume of revenue-paying customers, Virgin Galactic stock seems like it\u2019s going to get stuck on the launchpad.\n\nfuboTV (FUBO) FuboTV (FUBO) logo on iPhone display\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nfuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) is a streaming video business centered around live sports content. The idea is that a customer can subscribe to fuboTV and keep up with all their favorite sporting events in one place rather than having to deal with the hassle of various streaming subscription services.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s demand for product. Indeed, the company generated more than $1.3 billion of revenue last year, though competition is a concern. Rather, the big issue is that fuboTV has not found a path to profitability.\n\nThe company has to pay high prices for the licensing rights to those sporting events. It\u2019s such a problem that fuboTV has historically struggled to even generate a positive gross margin. That is to say fuboTV ends up paying almost as much to the sports events rightsholders as it brings in from subscribers, leaving virtually no profit whatsoever even before accounting for other business expenses.\n\nThere had been hopes that fuboTV could try to find other paths to monetization such as a live sports betting application. But these efforts have largely fizzled out. fuboTV still has a nearly half a billion dollar market cap. This seems excessive given the companies large and persistent operating losses and shaky balance sheet.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme. Illustrative photo for news about Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat substitutes. BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuite a few years ago, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) was a popular stock with traders. The company was one of the first to market with plant-based protein products. These appeared to be rapidly gaining appeal with health focused consumers.\n\nHowever, the landscape has dramatically changed over the past few years. Key partnerships with fast food restaurants failed to deliver the anticipated unit growth that Beyond Meat\u2019s investors had been banking on. In fact, plant protein products have lost so much steam that some formerly vegan restaurants are putting animal meat back on the menu.\n\nMeanwhile Beyond Meat\u2019s sales at grocery stores have slowed down amid rising competition. There are other plant-based food start-ups and also large package food companies such as Kellanova\u2019s (NYSE:K) Incogmeato product line which are pressuring Beyond Meat.\n\nBeyond Meat has struggled to generate positive gross margin on their products. This means it\u2019s costing them nearly as much simply to manufacture their plant-based food products as they resell for. After overhead, interest, taxes, and other such expenses Beyond Meat runs massive losses.\n\nThe company has a dramatically negative book value which implies that there is very little residual value for shareholders. With revenues slumping, and the company in debt and running large losses, BYND stock seems set to leave its investors with indigestion.\n\nOatly (OTLY) OTLY stock: Image of oat milk on a tray.\n\nSource: Katrinshine / Shutterstock.com\n\nOatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) is another alternative food company that finds itself in deep trouble.\n\nThe company rose the prominence thanks to its oat milk product which serves as an alternative to cow\u2019s milk.\n\nInvestors hoped that Oatly\u2019s partnerships with cafes and coffee shops could help give the brand a boost and drive consumer adoption more broadly. Unfortunately for Oatly, there\u2019s little evidence that the company has been able to become a powerful consumer brand.\n\nThe truth is that it hasn\u2019t been difficult for other producers to make their own versions or store brands of oat milk. Additionally, oat milk as a category hardly has a monopoly on the alternative dairy product space. There\u2019s soy milk, rice milk, almond milk, and it seems new types of\u00a0milk products arise almost every year.\n\nAs such, Oatly increasingly looks like a one trick pony whose trick wasn\u2019t that compelling. The company lost more than $400 million last year and analysts expect further large losses in 2024 and 2025. Given the company\u2019s poor balance sheet, it seems only a matter of time until Oatly runs into a liquidity squeeze.\n\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) movie playing during flight\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) is a discount airline focused on budget travelers. Instead of operating a traditional hub-and-spoke system, Spirit focuses on having a more specialized route network. It prioritizes routes which appeal to leisure travelers with ultra-low fares.\n\nLast year a rival airline, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), announced its intention to acquire Spirit. This caused SAVE shares to rally.\n\nHowever, the Department of Justice eventually blocked the merger on antitrust grounds, suggesting consumers would be harmed if the airlines merged.\n\nUnfortunately for Spirit, it finds itself in a weak position as an independent airline. The airline has been losing money, and it currently has significant capacity constraints due to engine defects that grounded a chunk of its fleet. In addition, the surging oil price will cause Spirit problems with jet fuel costs going forward.\n\nSome traders have rallied around Spirit Airlines, led by Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. These traders are hoping to turn Spirit into a meme stock.\n\nGiven the difficulties of the airline industry and Spirit\u2019s poor competitive positioning, however, traders should seek to get off this plane before it runs into further turbulence.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market seems to win even when it loses. Even as a strong jobs market report Friday hints that interest rate cuts are not coming in the next few months, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 gained several hundred points or about 1%.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s big comeback, many expected growth stocks to not power the indices higher again. But history shows stocks often have back-to-back strong performances after a down year. That\u2019s likely because bull markets tend to run for several years while bear markets usually last for less than 18 months.\n\nAlso, that accounts for Wall Street\u2019s bullish outlooks on most stocks. Only a relative handful of stocks are ever rated a sell. Analysts have an especially rosy outlook for the three companies below. They believe the stocks can run between 123% higher or more. Let\u2019s see whether Wall Street found a few growth stocks that are really hidden gems to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nHope springs eternal for movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which got decimated by the pandemic and has yet to recover. Its stock is doing even worse, losing 95% over its value from the 52-week high it hit last July. Analysts, though, still see the stock rising 137% in value over the coming year. Never mind the consensus sell rating on AMC stock. Even on the low side of estimates, there is hope for a 57% gain. What\u2019s going on here?\n\nB. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold has steadily lowered his price target on AMC Entertainment. It went from a high of $45 per share last September down to $8 a stub in March. All the while Wold remains neutral on its shares with a hold rating.\n\nTheStreet.com points out Wold highlighted AMC\u2019s better-than-expected earnings report due to distributing concert films from Taylor Swift and Beyonce. It suggests an avenue the theater owner can take in the future to boost revenue along with strong concession stand sales. Yet, delays in several anticipated movies this year were behind Wold\u2019s decision to cut his target price from $12 to $8 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is just wishful thinking. Theater attendance remains below pre-pandemic levels. Hollywood is not churning out many blockbuster films these days. The age of the super hero flick seems over and with more entertainment alternatives available, theaters will not recover the ground they lost. Wall Street might think AMC Entertainment stock can double or more from here. But investors would be better off avoiding it and looking elsewhere for opportunity.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) The logo for Archer Aviation (ACHR) displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWall Street also has high hopes for robotaxi stock Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR). Shares are down 30% in 2024 but over the past year they are up almost 60%. Analysts see the electrical vertical takeoff & landing (eVTOL) leader more than doubling in value. The median price target is $9.60 per share, or 123% of its current $4.30 price tag. Unlike AMC, Wall Street has a strong buy rating on the company.\n\nThere is good reason to be ebullient about Archer Aviation stock\u2019s potential. The eVTOL industry is being developed literally from the ground up. Archer and rivals like Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) and Lilium (NASDAQ:LILM) are creating something from nothing and are almost ready to launch commercial businesses.\n\nNormally, investing in such a situation would be high risk but the eVTOL industry really is on the brink of reality. Although ACHR is risky, the company benefits from support not only from airline and automotive industries but also the federal government. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been surprisingly supportive and accommodating to Archer, Joby and others. There is even cooperation from NASA and the Air Force.\n\nArcher has an order book for 700 aircraft once it receives FAA approval. And, the United Arab Emirates will permit it to immediately launch a robotaxi service when the FAA says \u201cgo.\u201d Wall Street might not have liked Archer\u2019s recent earnings report, but it\u2019s right in line with development-stage companies. Archer Aviation stock could be one the analysts are underselling.\n\nXpeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nWall Street sees Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) soaring over the coming year. Like the other stocks in this list, XPEV has fallen on hard times. Shares are down 50% in 2024 as EV sales growth stalls globally.\n\nAlthough the EV maker itself reported a 20% increase in deliveries in Q1, that\u2019s dramatically fewer deliveries than 171% increase reported in Q4 of 2023. And it\u2019s not alone in that regard. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and homegrown rival BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) also reported a significant dropoff in sales. So, it doesn\u2019t bode well for long-term growth.\n\nThat\u2019s why Wall Street\u2019s buy rating with a 140% gain for Xpeng stock is curious. At the high end of target price estimates, analysts see the EV stock soaring over 250% higher. It may be difficult to see that materializing.\n\nTo realize the 20% increase in deliveries this quarter, Xpeng had to double the incentives offered on its G9 model SUV and extend others. Even then, Xpeng was only able to cross over the lower end of its guidance for 21,000 to 22,500 deliveries in Q1. Ultimately, it had 21,821 for the period. That was just one-third of the 60,000 deliveries reported for Q4.\n\nWhile Xpeng stock might rise above its current $7.40 per share level, I don\u2019t see it doubling in value, let alone jumping 140% higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in KO and PG stock.

        "title": "Dow Knocking on the Door of 40,000",
        "content": "The stock market rang the doorbell of the New Year with a bang during the 1st quarter. The S&P 500 index built on last year's +24% gain with another +10% advance during the first three months of the year. And as a result of these increases, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index is knocking on the door of the 40,000 milestone more specifically, the Dow closed the month at 39,807 (see chart below). To put his into context, when I was born more than 50 years ago, the Dow was valued at less than 1,000 not a bad run. This is proof positive of what Einstein called the 8th Wonder of the World, compounding. At Sidoxia Capital Management, we view investing as a marathon, not a sprint. You cannot realize the benefits of compounding without having a long-term time horizon. The sooner you start saving and the more you save, the faster and larger your retirement nest egg will grow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with DJT. Dow Knocking on the Door of 40,000\n\nIf you are one of the people who thinks the stock market is too high, then you should definitely ignore Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), arguably the greatest investor of all-time. Buffett predicted the Dow will reach an astronomical level of one million (1,000,000) within the next 100 years. I'm not sure I will still be around to witness this momentous achievement, however, if history repeats itself, this targeted timeframe could prove conservative.\n\nDespite the magnitude and duration of this bull market, there is still a lot of angst and anxiety over the upcoming election. Nevertheless, investors are choosing instead to focus on the strong fundamentals of the economy. Just this last week, we saw the broadest measurement of economic activity, GDP (Gross Domestic Product), get revised higher to +3.4% growth during the 4th quarter of 2023 (see chart below). On the jobs front, the unemployment picture remains healthy (3.9%), near a generational low. Dow Knocking on the Door of 40,000\n\nSource: Trading Economics and Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd when it comes to the all-important inflation data, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, Core PCE index (Core Personal Consumption Expenditures), was also just released in-line with economists' projections at 2.5% (see chart below), very near the Fed's long-term 2.0% inflation target and well below the Core PCE's recent peak near 6%. Dow Knocking on the Door of 40,000\n\nSource: The Wall Street Journal and Commerce Department\n\nThis resilient economic data, when combined with the declining inflation figures, has resulted in the Federal Reserve sticking with its plan of cutting its Federal Funds interest rate target three times this year. If inflation reverses course or remains stubbornly high, then there is a higher likelihood that interest rate cuts will be delayed. On the flip side, if economic data slows significantly or the country goes into a recession, then the probability of sooner and/or more Fed interest-rate cuts will increase.\n\nIn other news, here are some of the other major financial headlines this month:\n\nFrancis Scott Key Baltimore Bridge Collapse: Six people died when a large container ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key bridge in the Port of Baltimore. An estimated 50 million tons of goods valued at $80 billion flows through this port, making this one of the top 10 ports in the country. The auto and coal industry supply chains will be disproportionately affected, but the good news is much of these goods will be diverted to other larger ports (e.g., Port of New York and Port of New Jersey). DJT Debut: A lot of hype surrounded the trading debut of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), which began trading last week under the initials of our country's former president, Donald J. Trump (Ticker: DJT). Despite only posting a few million in revenue and -$50 million in losses during the first nine months of 2023, the stock skyrocketed +65% in its first week of trading and attained a $9 billion valuation. Time will tell if Trump's Truth Social media platform will gain traction and justify the stock's price, or rather suffer the declining fate of other meme stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) or AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC). SBF Sentenced to 25 Years: The former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange company FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was sentenced to 25 years in prison due to his conviction on seven counts of fraud and what is believed to be $8 billion in stolen client funds. SBF didn't help his own cause by perjuring himself, tampering with witnesses, and showing a lack of remorse, according to the judge.\n\nWe are only 25% of the way through the year, but the Dow is knocking on the 40,000-milestone door.

        "content": "The stock formerly known as DWAC is now up nearly 520% from its public offering as a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company).\n\nIf there is a stock more overhyped than AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), my vote would be Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), the operators of a second-rate X, which itself has lost a lot of its shine since Elon Musk bought it.\n\nSince its launch in early 2021, the company has generated just $5.8 million in revenue, losing $32 million through the middle of 2023. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s doubled since then.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that their sales last year were less than $5 million, and they\u2019re losing significant money, it is hard to believe that the long-term economic value of this company could even be as high as $100 million,\u201d CBS reported comments from Harry Kraemer, a professor specializing in mergers and acquisitions at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. \u201cSo talking about billions is absolutely ridiculous from an economic standpoint.\u201d\n\nDarn straight. Don\u2019t waste your money on this speculative stock. Look at these three $50 to $60 stocks to buy over DWAC.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock closed the final day of March at $60.17, $1.79 below DJT. Of course, its market capitalization is $485 billion, significantly higher than Trump Media\u2019s purely speculative valuation of $8.4 billion.\n\nAnother striking difference between the two companies is that Walmart has directors who understand its business, unlike Trump Media\u2019s roster of Trump allies, Robert Lighthizer and Kash Patel. Among the seven directors, only Eric Swider has any tech experience while none of the seven, as far as I know, have ever worked in media.\n\nOf course, Walmart could buy Trump Media with its 2023 free cash flow of $12.2 billion.\n\nIn Nov. 2023, I recommended Walmart stock because of its use of AI to automate its supply chain and provide same-day delivery across the U.S. Given its size and scale; it will generate outsized profits in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump Media could only hope to generate this kind of revenue generation.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST)\u00a0 stock closed the final day of March at $59.28, $2.68 below DJT. Its market capitalization is $62 billion, significantly higher than that of Trump Media.\n\nOne thing Trump Media stock will never be able to do is match the energy drink maker\u2019s long-term performance. Over the past 30 years, no U.S.-listed stock has performed better. Between Feb. 14, 1994, and Feb. 14, 2024, it has appreciated by 200,000%, turning $1,000 into $2 million, a compound annual growth rate of nearly 29%.\n\n\u201cSome of it is clearly right place, right time,\u201d Stifel consumer and retail managing director Mark Astrachan told CNBC.  \u201cI think there\u2019s an element to it as well of being really good at what you can do, because you can\u2019t be as lucky as they\u2019ve been for as long as they\u2019ve been, without being really good at running a business.\u201d\n\nDelivering these kinds of returns over such a lengthy time frame is a tribute to a strong management team and founders, which Trump Media lacks.\n\nCarrier Global (CARR) Person holding mobile phone with webpage of US company Carrier Global Corporation (CARR) on screen in front of logo.

Its market cap is $52 billion, significantly higher than that of Trump Media.\n\nCarrier will gladly sell you one of their HVAC units if you live in a warm climate, which is most of the world due to global warming.\n\nCarrier recently was ranked 37th on Fortune\u2019s list of America\u2019s Innovative Companies.\n\n\u201cThrough rigorous innovation, Carrier is advancing its portfolio of solutions focused on efficiency and electrification, in support of the shift from fossil fuel to electric heating. Carrier has more than 6,000 engineers around the world focused every day on providing its customers with innovative and differentiated sustainable solutions,\u201d Carrier\u2019s March 26 press release stated.\n\nOn March 5, the company announced the sale of its Industrial Fire Business to Sentinel Capital Partners for $1.43 billion. It is selling the business to focus on its higher margin, growth climate, and energy solutions.\n\nThe net proceeds will pay down debt. Once it gets back to 2x leverage in 2024, it will resume share repurchases.\n\nNames like Carrier are iconic businesses worth owning for the long haul.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For the most part, Reddit\u2019s picks from 2021 haven\u2019t panned out well at all over the long term. You probably aren\u2019t going to find any standout stocks in the same place where you are finding fail videos and extremist political ramblings. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), for example, closed at $4.36 on March 1, versus its 2021 high of nearly $500, while GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), finished at $14.95 on March 1, down from its 2021 high of $120.75. Another Reddit favorite from a few years ago, Bed, Bath and Beyond, even went bankrupt, while headphone maker Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) tumbled from its 2021 high of $127 to $2.50.\n\nEven Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) which has been relatively successful amid the resilience of crypto prices, is still trading well below its 2021 high of $369. Those stocks\u2019 track records show that, over the longer term, powerful fundamentals and huge opportunities win out over bursts of popularity that are completely unjustified by fundamentals and reality-based outlooks. With that in mind, here are three stocks to buy that will indeed climb over the long term because their issuing firms have excellent businesses and great, easily converted opportunities.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

As a result, it\u2019s one of the best stocks to buy currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the firm\u2019s Watsonx AI platform is proving to be quite popular, with more than 150 enterprioses, including Citi (NYSE:C), NASA, and Samsung, using the system as of last July.\n\nFurthermore, IBM has since made the platform more appealing by partnering with Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit, AWS, to allow its customers \u201cto quickly and responsibly scale AI workloads by using a comprehensive stack of generative AI, which consists of Amazon Bedrock and IBM watsonx running on AWS Cloud and across hybrid cloud environments.\u00a0\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more organizations greatly increase their use of AI, the growth of the firm\u2019s Data & AI revenue will accelerate, Seeking Alpha columnist Uttam Dey recently predicted.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI.

GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had more than its share of skeptics in recent weeks, as bears have questioned whether the firm\u2019s search engine can withstand challenges from AI chatbots and the answers provided by its own AI to certain questions offended some users.\n\nHowever, old habits are hard to break, so I predict that most users will continue to rely on Google\u2019s search engine for many years to come. Furthermore, according to a majority of sources, Alphabet\u2019s underlying AI technology is actually very strong.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the tech giant, which had nearly $111 billion of cash as of the end of last quarter, can afford to make acquisitions and hire many experts to greatly improve the quality of its AI offerings over the longer term.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m confident that by 2030, Waymo will contribute considerable amounts to the firm\u2019s top and bottom lines.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nComputer network equipment maker Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 12, showing that it\u2019s benefiting meaningfully from the AI boom.\n\nThe firm\u2019s top line climbed by an impressive 21% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income rose to $513.6 million, up from $427.1 million in Q4 of 2022.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s most prolific customers are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), which are also two of the largest beneficiaries of the AI Revolution. As MSFT and Meta continue to get big boosts from their deployment of AI, Arista\u2019s financial results should continue to surge.\n\nAmong the 21 Wall Street analysts who cover the name, 13 rate it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and two have \u201cBuy\u201d ratings on it.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to advance to $7.59 this year and $8.56 next year from the $6.94 of EPS that it generated in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in COIN.

        "title": "13 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best short squeeze stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our primer on short squeezing, and some of the greatest short squeezes in history, then you can take a look at the\u00a05 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nShort selling is one of the most controversial aspects of the stock market. After all, investing is typically thought to be a 'value creating' endeavor, where both retail and professional players engage in trading to pick the right stock and make millions if not billions of dollars.\n\nOn the flip side, short selling comes with the aim of profiting from the drop in share price. Those who argue in its favor belief that it allows market players to exploit weaknesses and be rewarded for their actions. A rather controversial practice short sellers benefit when the shares of a firm, such as the well known U.S. green vehicle designer Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) or the Indian business conglomerate Adani Enterprises Limited (NSE:ADANIENT.NS), drop in value. Yet, this same drop harms existing investors as well, an occurrence that ensures that short selling will remain controversial as long as the stock markets continue to exist.\n\nWhile the profits of short selling stocks are lucrative, at the same time, betting against the wrong names can be disastrous and wipe out entire portfolios. While short sellers who target Nikola and Adani ended up being richer, the stock market is also filled with examples of stocks that ended up being short squeeze stocks. One source of controversy surrounding short selling surrounds the fact that bets against a stock are publicly visible. So, you can see what the short interest in a stock that trades on the NASDAQ exchange is simply by visiting the exchange's website. As a result, at least when it comes to the retail front, if a stock has a substantial amount of short interest, then investors looking to pick it as a long term, value creating investment will naturally wonder if there's something under the hood that's amiss.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, and particularly as events after the coronavirus pandemic have shown, short squeeze stocks can also change the fortunes of those lucky or wise enough to pick them. The pandemic, which saw populations all over the world sent indoors, also led to the two biggest short squeezes in history, the meme stocks GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC). GameStop's short squeeze dented Wall Street in ways previously unimaginable, and it even led to Senate hearings of Reddit forum members.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the all time legendary short squeeze stocks, while GameStop is well known, there are tons of others that have made even larger impacts. For instance, even as of 2021, when Insider Monkey took a look at 10 Biggest Short Squeezes of All Time, the biggest short squeeze after 13 years was Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY). The Volkswagen short squeeze cost short sellers more than three times in losses than GameStop, fueled by the fact that as Volkwagen's shares soared, it became the most valuable company in the world with a share price of \u20ac999.\n\nThe saga of Volkswagen's legendary short squeeze is more complex than the tale written by the GameStop traders. At its heart was the hedge fund industry, which sought to exploit the price differential between the firm's preferred and ordinary stock in the aftermath of legal developments in Germany that enabled a Volkswagen takeover through holding a 75% interest in the firm. Preferred stock, for those out of the loop, is a dividend paying security that does not offer its holder a stake in a publicly traded company's governance.\n\nWhen the difference in the prices between the two share classes started to grow, investors sold 12% of the ordinary shares short. But, they were caught with their pants down after Porsche revealed that it had quietly bought nearly 75% of Volkswagen's stock. This meant that as Porsche and a German State owned nearly 94% of the shares, half of those who had shorted the stock would be left without the ability to close their bets. Consequently, the mad scupper to buy Volkswagen shares ensured that Volkswagen became the world's most valuable company.

And for a billionaire's trysts with short selling, check out Stanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 Stocks.\n\nSo, are there any short squeeze stocks that might also surprise investors? While nobody can pick such stocks and the ones today could very well drop instead, we did try and the top names were Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH), Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA), and\u00a0Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA). 13 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA professional banker wearing a suit and tie, helping a customer deposit money.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best short squeeze stocks, we first made a list of stocks with 20% of their float sold short, price 10% above 200 day simple moving average, shortable options, and a relative volume greater than 25%. They were then ranked by the number of hedge fund investors that had invested in them as of Q4 2023 end.\n\nFor these short squeeze stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now\n\n13. Tango Therapeutics, Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at some of the least shorted stocks. To read the second part of this article, click 5 Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nIt's commonly said among investor circles that short selling is one of the most difficult strategies to make money in the stock market. The events of 2023 showed why. According to S3 Partners, short sellers lost about $178 billion in 2023 amid broader stock market rally driven by the AI boom. Most of these losses for short sellers came from Magnificent Seven stocks. A Yahoo Finance's analysis of S3 Partners' data showed that the biggest losses for short sellers came from Tesla, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta and Apple.\n\nIt seems short sellers are experiencing a squeeze from all sides as new regulations and a generally tough environment makes betting against stocks difficult by the day. Last year the SEC finalized new rules that would require hedge funds to tell the SEC which companies they sell short. Institutional money managers with large short positions will have to file forms with details of their short bets with the SEC. The new rules come two years after the 2021 short squeeze drama which saw Redditors band together to boost share prices of companies like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) that were heavily shorted by major hedge funds.\n\nShort selling remains an important trading activity that, in many cases, puts a much-needed check on companies and provides interesting data points and perspectives for the broader market. That's why it's important to keep an eye on short interest of stocks. Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com Methodology\n\nLast month, BofA published its Managers\u2019 Holdings Update report in which it listed stocks with the least short interest by hedge funds as a percentage of float. For this article we scanned BofA list of least shorted stocks and picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\n15. Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 53\n\nWater treatment services and solutions company Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL) ranks 15th in our list of the least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nOf the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, 53 hedge funds had stakes in Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL). The most notable stakeholder of Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL)\u00a0was Michael Larson's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust which owns an $884 million stake in Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL).\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLong-time ClearBridge holding\u00a0Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) stands out as a responsible steward of water resources and a company able to reduce impact from use of water across the economy. Ecolab offers water-saving solutions for laundries used by health care, hospitality and food and beverage industries. Products and services include industrial water pre-treatment systems, industrial water reuse, water-efficient conveyor lubrication systems and wastewater treatment. For a major hotel chain, Ecolab\u2019s chemical product delivery service replaces single-use drums of cleaning chemical, reducing waste and improving work safety, while its warewashing and housekeeping solutions reduce wash time, water usage and water temperature for food prep wares as well as plastic packaging used in housekeeping services. Ecolab estimates 57 million gallons of water savings as well as 1,400 metric tons of GHG emissions annually for the hotel chain as a result.\n\nEcolab has committed to helping its customers conserve 300 billion gallons of water a year, equivalent to the annual drinking water needs of 1 billion people by 2030, through reducing water withdrawal needs in customers\u2019 operations. Separately, Ecolab also has a target to restore >50% of its absolute water withdrawal at high-risk sites through collaboration with NGOs and local communities. Ecolab is also a co-founder of the Water Resilience Coalition, a CEO-led movement and part of the United Nations Global Compact aiming to preserve the world\u2019s freshwater resources through action in water-stressed basins.\u201d\n\n14. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nWith over six decades of dividend increases and a highly resilient business, Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) is one of the best least shorted stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO).\n\nUnlike AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), Coca-Cola does not have a history of attracting short sellers in the past.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US,\u00a0The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n13. Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 59\n\nMedical device company Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\u00a0shares have gained about 4.7% year to date in 2024 through February 6.\n\nOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 59 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT). The biggest stakeholder in Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\u00a0was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $477 million stake in Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT).\n\n12. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 62\n\nBofA's research shows Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\u00a0had just 0.54% short interest as a percentage of float, which makes it one of the least shorted stocks.\n\nOf the 62 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database that had stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\u00a0as of the end of the third quarter, Terry Smith's Fundsmith LLP had a $1.4 billion stake in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM).\n\n11. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nBofA's research shows that Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) is one of the least shorted stocks on the Wall Street, with just 0.64% short interest as a percentage of float. Last month, Piper Sandler added to the stock to its high conviction stocks list. Piper Sandler said the stock scores well on profitability, earnings growth and free cash flow generation.\n\nOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 65 hedge funds had stakes in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)\u00a0as of the end of the third quarter. The biggest stake in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)\u00a0is owned by Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group which owns a $1.1 billion stake.\n\nBaron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added to our position in\u00a0Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products used to treat atrial fibrillation, such as pulsed field ablation, among others. The company held an Investor Day in September at which management established financial targets for the 2024 to 2026 period calling for an organic sales CAGR of 8% to 10%, 150 basis points of margin expansion, and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improved free-cash-flow conversion. We think this growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.\u201d\n\n10. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the top least shorted stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Last month Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.19 meeting estimates. Revenue in the quarter jumped 1.4% year over year to $10.24 billion, surpassing estimates by $50 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, \u00a069 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). The biggest stakeholder of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\u00a0during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $939 million stake in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cHealth care facilities operator HCA Healthcare and medical device company\u00a0Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) were also among our bottom contributors. Abbott Labs was impacted by concerns about potential threats to its diabetes franchise from new drugs. A majority of Abbott\u2019s continuous glucose monitor (CGM) customers rely on insulin for their treatment, which means their disease will not respond to the newer medications. This concern negatively impacted investor sentiment and, in turn, Abbott\u2019s share price, leading to underperformance in the recent quarter.\u201d\n\n9. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 75\n\nConsumer goods giant Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\u00a0has a very low short interest as the Wall Street views it as a defensive and safe play to buy, thanks to its diversified business and over six decades of consistent dividend increases.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 75 hedge funds out of the 910 funds had stakes in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). The biggest stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\u00a0is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\nWhile AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) have a history of attracting short bets from hedge funds, it's a rarity to see money managers going against established giants like Procter & Gamble.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe sold The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). After two years of strong pricing growth, the company is facing slower market growth in both the US and Europe. China, the company\u2019s second largest individual market, is facing a protracted downturn with poor visibility on when fundamentals will improve.\u201d\n\n8. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 80\n\nWalmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is one of the top least shorted stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. As of the end of the September 2023 quarter, 80 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).\n\nCiti recently published its list of top large-cap stock recommendations. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u00a0made it to the list. Citi estimates EPS of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u00a0to come in at $7.32 this year while P/E is expected to be at 22.\n\n7. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 84\n\nWith decades of consistent dividend increases and strong fundamentals, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ranks seventh in our list of the best least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nLast month Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\u00a0posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.29, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the period jumped 73% year over year to $21.4 billion.\n\nOf the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, 84 hedge funds had stakes in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe health care space provided some opportunities in the quarter, as we increased our exposure to medical device company Becton, Dickinson as well as large cap pharmaceutical company\u00a0Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Johnson & Johnson recently spun out its consumer health care business, becoming a more focused yet broadly diversified pharmaceutical and medtech company.\u201d\n\n6. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 88\n\nDespite weak earnings posted in December 2023, Oracle is one of the least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 88 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported a disappointing second quarter due to supply constraints. Cloud revenue was below expectations as Oracle made planning decisions to accommodate some large-scale Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) clients that take longer to bring online. We continue to believe that Oracle has a unique position in Generative AI workloads and continue to like its position and strategy.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now 13 Best Grocery Stocks To Buy Now 15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a015 Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "It\u2019s Time! 7 Lackluster Meme Stocks to Sell in February",
        "content": "Savvy investors are shifting their focus towards meme stocks to sell, adapting to the stock market\u2019s changing trends where meme stocks have fallen out of favor. The trend, fueled by social media, morphed low-quality stocks into overnight sensations, spurring short-lived surges in value as online communities banded together. However, the excitement surrounding these stocks often masks the risks involved with such investments, making it imperative to scrutinize these volatile assets.\n\nAs the allure of meme stocks wanes, those that once dominated headlines now flounder, shedding most of their gains. Driven more by hype than solid fundamentals, these stocks present mostly perilous ventures. Therefore, investors need to be cautious and prioritize long-term stability over the fleeting gains of meme stocks. With that said, here are seven unattractive meme stocks bets likely to erode shareholder value further.\n\nMeme Stocks to Sell: AMC Entertainment (AMC) In this photo illustration the stock market information of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. displays on a smartphone while the logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. APE stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRenowned movie theatre chain, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), faces an uphill battle. Over the past year, its shares plummeted by roughly 90%. Moreover, this downturn is further exacerbated by a massive debt load of $9.32 billion. Adding to AMC\u2019s predicament, external challenges such as the Hollywood writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes have pushed project timelines further out, casting a shadow over AMC\u2019s prospects for 2024 and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the market responded unfavorably to AMC\u2019s strategic moves, evidenced by a 30% stock price drop following the announcement to sell up to 40 million new shares in September 2023. Additionally, AMC\u2019s efforts to reduce these challenges and its debt through debt-for-equity swaps have resulted in more shareholder dilution, increasing analyst skepticism over its future. Consequently, Quant analysts assign a \u2018strong sell,\u2019 rating to AMC stock, underscoring its challenging recovery path.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME), a top retailer in video games and gear, is navigating a rough terrain. Its share price is down more than 34.6% in the past year, a worrying drop in value. The company\u2019s challenges are amplified by market volatility, tied to speculative trading on online platforms and social media. Such exposure has caused its stock price to fluctuate wildly, largely driven by conversations on forums such as Reddit.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, GameStop\u2019s revenue fell to $1.08 billion, a 9.11% drop, missing expectations by $103.92 million. This downturn is part of a broader trend, with total assets decreasing by 5.29% and free cash plummeting by 99.24%, underscoring the company\u2019s financial distress.\n\nFurthermore, TipRanks analysts aren\u2019t optimistic, assigning GME stock a \u2018moderate sell\u2019 rating and forecasting a potential downside of 57.51%. Hence, this grim outlook and the company\u2019s current market position suggest a bleak future for investors.\n\nMullen Automotive (MULN) Mullen Automotive offers superior, technologically advanced electric vehicles. Their premium quality EVs pioneer a sustainable, eco-friendly future. MULN stock\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN), an electric vehicle maker, reported a staggering $1 billion loss last year, with its stock plummeting 99.8%.\n\nDespite delivering 231 vehicles worth $11.9 million in the fourth quarter, Mullen hasn\u2019t recognized any revenue. Moreover, the company is struggling to build momentum as it continues to burn cash at an alarming pace each quarter. Its return on common equity at a negative 960% is indicative of its financial woes, likely to weigh down its future prospects.\n\nWith the CEO announcing in December 2023 the need to raise capital in 2024 to fund operations until becoming cash flow positive, Mullen\u2019s future looks bleak. Given the abundance of better investment opportunities in the EV sphere, it\u2019s best to steer clear of this stock at this time.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Gaithersburg MD June 26, 2021 Carvana (CVNA) Auto Dealership\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarvana (NYSE:CVNA), once celebrated as a pandemic success, is now in a major spot of bother, with its stock still more than 85% below its peak despite a 380.6% rally over the past year. This stark contrast underscores the auto retailer\u2019s rollercoaster journey, now plagued by consecutive unprofitable quarters.\n\nThe excitement of being initially hailed as a tech titan has dwindled as reality sets in, with revenue growth plunging to negative 23% year-over-year (YOY), starkly underperforming the sector\u2019s median at 5.2%. Moreover, CVNA\u2019s future appears bleak, with forward revenue growth projected at negative 4% amidst a broader market slowdown. Its latest quarterly earnings reflects this downturn, where revenue fell 18.10% YOY to $2.77 billion.\n\nCompounding Carvana\u2019s woes is the declining auto market, particularly for used cars, where prices and demand are dwindling at a worrying pace. This trend will likely further impact Carvana\u2019s top and bottom-line results, suggesting that the road ahead is fraught with challenges.\n\nMeme stocks to sell: Nikola Corp (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nNikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) is now grappling with a stark downturn. The company\u2019s struggle to maintain its stock above the critical $1 threshold has led to another NASDAQ warning, hinting at a possible delisting. This decline is closely tied to the fall of its founder, Trevor Milton, who faces significant legal challenges, including securities and wire fraud charges.\n\nThe firm\u2019s woes deepened last year when it halted the production of its Tre battery-electric trucks due to fire risk in the battery packs, indicating severe operational setbacks. This stoppage, expected to extend into this year, underscores the severity of Nikola\u2019s challenges.\n\nAmid these struggles, Nikola\u2019s market position has rapidly deteriorated, with its stock plummeting 70% over the past year. A disappointing third-quarter report deepens the concern, showing a Non-GAAP earnings-per-share (EPS) loss of 30 cents, 16 cents below expectations, and a negative $1.73 million revenue shortfall. These figures highlight the grim reality facing Nikola as it navigates through a turbulent period.\n\nFaze Holdings (FAZE) Counter Strike: Global Offensive esports event. Main stage with a big screen and team FAZE clan logo.\n\nSource: Roman Kosolapov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFaze Holdings (NASDAQ:FAZE) is a popular esports business that has witnessed significant volatility, with its stock plummeting more than 72.5% over the past year. The firm\u2019s struggles stem from a misalignment between its business management and the ethos that originally fueled its fame. It lead to key members departing to become individual influencers, eroding its market value. Compounding these challenges, allegations of involvement in crypto scandals have further dented FAZE\u2019s credibility.\n\nFinancial indicators reflect FAZE\u2019s diminishing position, with YOY sales growth down by 10.7% and gross profit plunging by 84.8%. Additionally, net income dropped a staggering 94.5%, underscoring its precarious financial position. The combination of internal misalignments, controversy, and stark financial downturns underscores a period of major uncertainty for the company. With such instability, the company\u2019s path forward appears fraught with challenges, signaling caution for investors.\n\nBlackberry (BB)\n\nSource: BlackBerry\n\nTransitioning from a phone manufacturer to a cybersecurity and IoT firm did little to prevent BlackBerry\u2019s (NYSE:BB) decline. Its share price went down 45.21% over the past year. The drop was driven not just by a decrease in market interest in risky investments but also by the company\u2019s financial setbacks, including missing revenue targets by $5.8 million and a quarterly net loss that ballooned by 425%.\n\nThe company is struggling to turn around its fortunes, pushing towards positive cash flow through cost-cutting and margin expansion efforts. Despite these initiatives and reducing its debt by more than 40%, it\u2019s under major duress with regard to financial visibility and ability to secure financing. Additionally, BlackBerry\u2019s aggressive downsizing, including laying off employees and exiting global office locations, reflects its desperate measures to stabilize finances.\n\nFurthermore, Quant analysts have cast a pall over BB\u2019s prospects, tagging it with a \u2018strong sell\u2019 rating. The convergence of disappointing financial performance and investor skepticism paints a grim future for BlackBerry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

These ideas may be odd but they may offer the right balance of novelty and competitive fuel to jump ahead.\n\nIt\u2019s just like running plays in (American) football. In many, if not most situations, you want to run derivations of the classic I-formation. It gives you the flexibility to run the ball or throw the occasional pass. But now and then, you want to use some misdirection, a bootleg, some razzle dazzle \u2013 anything to keep the opposing defense honest.\n\nThat\u2019s what maverick stocks do for you. With so many eyeballs trained on the conventional names, the upside potential may be limited. However, throw a play-action pass at the right moment and you can pick more than the first-down marker.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to walk the path least traveled, check out these maverick stocks to buy.\n\nCorsair Gaming (CRSR) corsair keyboard zoomed in on the logo\n\nA computer peripherals and hardware company, Corsair Gaming (NASDAQ:CRSR) designs and sells a range of computer products. These include high-speed DRAM modules, power supplies, USB flash drives and processor and case cooling solutions. For the uninitiated, these products may seem like overkill. However, video games have evolved into far more than a niche hobby. Instead, it\u2019s very much a viable industry.\n\nStill, it hasn\u2019t been an easy ride. According to investment data aggregator Gurufocus, Corsair features a negative three-year revenue growth rate. Admittedly, that sounds terrible. In 2022, revenue slipped to about $1.4 billion following sales of over $1.9 billion in 2021. However, last year, the company managed to improve annual revenue to $1.46 billion.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to exercise patience, CRSR could be one of the compelling maverick stocks to buy. With the latest jobs reports showing more people with more money, discretionary pursuits like gaming may blossom. In turn, this dynamic could boost Corsair\u2019s market value.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $15.50. Further, the high-side target lands at a robust $18.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nA video game developer, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) makes for an intriguing idea among maverick stocks. First, RBLX\u2019s soft market performance suggests that it could represent a discount over the long run. Since about March of 2022, Roblox shares have generally gone flat. At the same time, over the past six months, the bulls appear to be cooking up something special.\n\nSecond, the company enjoys strong fundamental relevance. According to Precedence Research, the global video game market size reached an estimated valuation of $224.9 billion in 2022. Experts project that by 2032, the segment could hit around $610.6 billion. If so, that would imply a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5%.\n\nAdditionally, Roblox distinguishes itself from the crowd by encouraging gamers to develop their own digital worlds. Best of all, people can share their creation within the Roblox community. It\u2019s been disappointing since its public market debut but RBLX could make a comeback. At least, that\u2019s what analysts think with a moderate buy view with a $49.79 price target.\n\nVeolia (VEOEF) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.\n\nSource: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com\n\nA name that\u2019s perfect for maverick stocks because you don\u2019t really hear it often, Veolia (OTCMKTS:VEOEF) nevertheless deserves to be on your radar. A French transnational company, Veolia engages in three main service and utility areas: water management, waste management and energy services. All three obviously command significant relevance. However, the water management component truly intrigues.\n\nSpecifically, the company offers a key solution in the fight against water scarcity through desalination. This process involves converting salt water into potable (drinking) water. And while early technologies suffered from economic viability issues, improvements in the area could make the innovation work.\n\nFurther, Straits Research points out that the global water desalination market reached a valuation of $19.22 billion in 2022. By 2031, the segment could hit just over $43 billion, representing a CAGR of 9.12%. Adding to the pot, VEOEF trades at only 13.7X forward earnings, well below the sector median of 23.63X.\n\nAnalysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with a $38.86 price target. That\u2019s hardly a surprise given the importance of its mission.\n\nMarcus (MCS) An empty movie theater.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to investing in cineplex operators, there appears to be only one name: AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). To be sure, AMC symbolized one of the top maverick stocks during the pandemic. However, since its glory days of 2021, AMC has stumbled badly. Nevertheless, if you still want to participate in this sector, you ought to consider Marcus (NYSE:MCS).\n\nPer its public profile, the company operates two principal divisions: Marcus Hotels and Resorts and Marcus Theatres. I\u2019m going to focus on the latter category. One key advantage that MCS offers over the competition is location. Generally speaking, Marcus Theatres are located in more Midwestern states like Ohio and Nebraska. Fundamentally, that\u2019s a huge potential catalyst because these are the states millennials are moving to.\n\nFurther, if working from home continues to become the established norm, it doesn\u2019t really make much sense for folks to insist on living in overpriced metropolitan areas. Therefore, Marcus is situated where the money will be. Since September of last year, analysts have been bullish on MCS.\n\nPetco (WOOF) The front of a Petco (WOOF) store in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSource: Walter Cicchetti / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile not exactly one of the maverick stocks from a narrative standpoint, Petco (NASDAQ:WOOF) can only attract a certain type of bold investor at the moment. That\u2019s because the pet retailer and services specialist lost a heavy amount of equity value in the past 52 weeks. Over the past five years, the print is even worse, warranting serious anxieties.\n\nStill, the speculation is that the downside moves it incurred in late January is the bottom. If so, WOOF could see tremendous upside in a recovery run. It\u2019s not an inconceivable concept. According to the American Pet Products Association, projected 2023 sales of the U.S. pet market come in at $143.6 billion. That would be a noticeable improvement over the $136.8 billion in sales generated in 2022.\n\nEven better, if these projected numbers hold up, it would mean that American pet owners continued to spend on their furry friends despite onerous pressure from high inflation and high borrowing costs. It\u2019s not wonder, then, that analysts still peg WOOF as a consensus moderate buy with a $3.82 price target.\n\nSturm Ruger (RGR) An LCP Custom handgun manufactured by Sturm Ruger (RGR).\n\nSource: Susan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com\n\nI guess we can\u2019t have a discussion about maverick stocks without diving into some controversy. Fundamentally, one of my ideas for investments that don\u2019t align with the mainstream crowd is Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR). It\u2019s a firearms manufacturer so it\u2019s not going to get much love. Frankly, I don\u2019t really recall a time that the industry ever received outstanding support given the rise in gun violence.\n\nWithout getting bogged down into a political discussion, let me just focus on the economics. According to the Pew Research Center in 2017, three-in-ten American adults stated that they currently own a gun. Another 11% reported that while they don\u2019t own a firearm, they live with someone that does. Moreover, this statistic surely skyrocketed following the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPut another way, it will be ideologically difficult to isolate gun owners in America. There are just so many of them. And the industry itself could enjoy a cynical rally if President Joe Biden wins a second term.\n\nAnalysts aren\u2019t exactly weighing in on RGR. But back in November, Lake Street pegged shares a \u201cbuy\u201d with a $64 target.\n\nFunko (FNKO) A stack of Funko Pop! boxes from Funko .\n\nSource: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps the quirkiest idea among maverick stocks to buy, Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) manufactures licensed and limited pop culture collectibles. It\u2019s best known for its licensed vinyl figurines and bobbleheads. Personally, I found the concept ridiculous at first. However, through friends and colleagues, I discovered that there\u2019s serious demand for Funko figurines \u2013 especially certain collectable versions.\n\nOn the financial front, circumstances present a mixed bag. For example, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 7.1%, beating out 68% of its peers. On the other hand, revenue has been fading in recent quarters. It also suffers from a low cash level relative to debt. Therefore, a lot rides on pop-culture relevance and the brand\u2019s popularity with young consumers.\n\nStill, with a booming jobs market, it\u2019s possible that Funko could get out of its funk over the past year. Analysts anticipate that shares will hit $8.50 over the next 12 months. At the high side, FNKO may shoot up to $10.50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Unconventional Investments to Shake Up Your Portfolio",
        "content": "While crowd mass can be comforting, venturing out into the wilderness of unconventional investments can also be rewarding. For one thing, investors can enjoy personal satisfaction for a pioneering endeavor. And because few people are so bold, the returns could be better than expected.\n\nAdditionally, unconventional investments offer portfolio diversification. As we recently saw with the market falloff \u2013 a result of hotter-than-anticipated inflation numbers \u2013 putting your eggs in similar baskets could lead to unmitigated red ink in your holdings. Instead, going the oddball direction can be weird enough to protect you from too much exposure to one particular sector.\n\nFinally, certain investments that seem peculiar now could be labeled astute down the line. With economic conditions still fragile in some respects, these are the unconventional investments to target.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOutfront Media (OUT) man in suit holding a tablet with graphic above showing oversold stocks to buy\n\nSource: undefined undefined / Getty Images\n\nLet\u2019s start this discussion of unconventional investments with Outfront Media (NYSE:OUT), perhaps the most oddball entity on this list. One of the largest outdoor advertisement companies, Outfront operates primarily in the U.S. and Canada. If you\u2019ve seen a billboard driving down the freeway or watched one of the adverts on public transportation vehicles, you\u2019re probably familiar with the company\u2019s work.\n\nAt first glance, you might be concerned about relevance. People are working from home. And if they\u2019re outside, folks are glued to their smart devices. Therefore, billboards and related advertising media don\u2019t seem to resonate with the modern audience. However, Polaris Market Research has some intriguing data: the global outdoor advertising sector could hit a valuation of $40.49 billion by 2032.\n\nGranted, the domestic market may be a different animal. However, with more companies pushing for in-person collaboration, a return to the old normal could shockingly boost demand. To be fair, only a sole analyst covers OUT and it\u2019s a pensive hold. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time unconventional investments have shook up Wall Street.\n\nStory continues\n\nService Corp (SCI) people in suits carry a casket at a funeral\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConfession time: Service Corp (NYSE:SCI) ranks among the unconventional investments because no one really wants to talk about their mortality. I know some morticians on social media push the idea of focusing on the importance of final services. But allow me to be honest \u2013 it\u2019s just an icky topic. Still, on a very cynical level, it\u2019s an incredibly relevant market idea.\n\nBasically, the total addressable market for Service Corp is \u201cinfinite.\u201d Well, maybe not literally. According to the laws of physics, mass cannot be created nor destroyed. So, at some point, Service will run out of space if it doesn\u2019t expand. But here\u2019s a fun fact for you. Approximately, we have 332 million people in the U.S. and they\u2019re all going to pass away.\n\nRemember, this is physics. Society must do something with the leftover mass after your soul retires (if you believe in that sort of thing). Unsurprisingly, analysts peg shares a unanimous strong buy with a $73.67 price target.\n\nPublic Storage (PSA) a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildings\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a business, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) represents a common one. Every household eventually finds value in storage space, even if they never fork over the money to get it. However, PSA and its ilk don\u2019t typically stand among popular investment ideas. Indeed, they would be considered unconventional investments. However, the unique dynamics tied to the Covid-19 aftershock should make PSA very intriguing.\n\nAs you know, inflation skyrocketed following the pandemic, with the most conspicuous effect stemming from the housing market. With so many people priced out of real estate \u2013 and subsequently rentals \u2013 little recourse existed other than to downsize. And that\u2019s where a company like Public Storage could benefit as one of the unconventional investments to consider. It makes the process of downsizing much more palatable.\n\nIn addition, you have elements such as baby boomers retiring. They don\u2019t need expansive real estate so they\u2019ll downsize too, storing bulky heirlooms in storage units. Analysts rate PSA a moderate buy, likely based on the forward relevance.\n\nDeere (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn agricultural play, Deere (NYSE:DE) may not get as much love as the industrial equipment manufacturer Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). So, it might be one of the unconventional investments in that regard. Still, Deere is vitally important. Focused on manufacturing agricultural machinery, heavy equipment and forestry machinery among others, Deere helps keep this nation running.\n\nA pleasant irony is that Deere is unconventional in its embrace of advanced technologies. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2022, Deere revealed a fully autonomous tractor ready for large-scale production. Combining traditional tractor machinery with a GPS guidance system and new advanced technologies \u2013 including a neural network that can detect obstructions \u2013 Deere is not afraid of change.\n\nTo be fair, DE is off to a slow start this year. However, in the past five years, it\u2019s up almost 139%. That\u2019s because it never really gave up its post-Covid gains. Analysts peg DE a moderate buy with a $428.11 price target, implying 13% upside potential.\n\nMarcus (MCS) An empty movie theater.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTo be sure, betting on movie theaters doesn\u2019t rank among unconventional investments. Much of the early days of Covid featured speculation on AMC Theatres (NYSE:AMC). However, Marcus (NYSE:MCS) is a relative oddball. Featuring two principal divisions, one of them happens to be as a movie theater operator. However, the main difference here \u2013 the reason why MCS is compelling \u2013 centers on geography.\n\nAccording to its website, Marcus Theatres owns 79 locations. They\u2019re located in states such as Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, and Virginia. As well, it features locations in some western-ish states such as Colorado and Texas. Now, why does that matter? As stated earlier, many people found themselves priced out of the housing market. To get a home, you can either downsize or move to a cheaper state.\n\nWith remote work still a thing \u2013 though that could change \u2013 more people may choose to migrate to areas which Marcus serves. Since September of last year, three analysts love this math, rating shares a buy. The most recent price target stands at $19, implying almost 34% growth.\n\nGoodyear Tire (GT) Sign for Goodyear (GT) tire shop. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is an American tire manufacturing company.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany years ago in the financial publication space, I remember pitching Goodyear Tire (NASDAQ:GT) to incredulous laughter. Editors couldn\u2019t believe that I seriously brought up GT stock as a viable equity idea. That provides a small anecdote as to why Goodyear is one of the unconventional investments. Yes, people need tires for their vehicles. But do they need rubber in their portfolio?\n\nTo be upfront, GT just tanked, with the underlying enterprise reporting disappointing financial results. While the company beat on earnings, its tire sales fell by about 3.8% last year. Also, management anticipates global tire volume to slip about 2% in the current quarter. Subsequently, GT stock hemorrhaged 15% of equity value.\n\nAlthough the print didn\u2019t match expectations, Goodyear also anticipates raw material costs to come down on a year-over-year basis. Plus, we should remember that we\u2019re dealing with a permanently relevant idea. Good economy or bad, people need to replace their tires when the time comes. Analysts are looking at the big picture, pegging GT a strong buy with a $17.95 average price target.\n\nEZCorp (EZPW) Man buying gold jewellry, pawn shop and us dollar banknotes\n\nSource: Miriam Doerr Martin Frommherz via Shutterstock\n\nWhen you think about pawn shops, you think about certain reality television programs, not a publicly traded company. But that\u2019s exactly what EZCorp (NASDAQ:EZPW) is, a Nasdaq-listed pawn shop operator based in Austin, Texas. It also holds the distinction as the second-largest pawn shop operator in the U.S., per its public profile.\n\nEZCorp qualifies as one of the unconventional investments because arguably most people regard the underlying business as a novelty retailer. Further, people usually turn to banks or financial technology (fintech) solutions for loans. However, Statista points out that pawn shops enjoy surprisingly robust demand. About 30 million Americans use such establishments to secure loans. In exchange, they offer their personal property as collateral.\n\nNotably, the industry has over $14 billion in revenue. Now, should the economy experience trouble, EZPW stock could cynically benefit. Naturally, financial woes tend to incentivize lending services. Currently, Canaccord Genuity\u2019s Brian McNamara rates shares a \u201cbuy\u201d with a $17 target, implying over 63% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Buy on the Dip: February 2024",
        "content": "In the beginning, meme stocks to buy pitted the bulls against the bears. The market was without form and void of the knowledge of social media. That is until the hedge funds fooled around and found out.\n\nHowever, those days seem to be long gone. Sure, you will always find people willing to speculate on popular, social-media-driven enterprises. But the zenith of the wild movement appears to be firmly in the rearview mirror. Still, that\u2019s not going to stop folks from trying to get something going.\n\nIf I\u2019ve learned from my interactions with ardent proponents of meme stocks, it\u2019s this: appealing to reason isn\u2019t usually the most productive endeavor. It comes down to the reality that people want what they want. So, if you want meme stocks, let\u2019s have at it with the true classics.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it may be sexy to go contrarian with meme stocks, when analysts tell you to run from an enterprise, you probably should. That\u2019s the case with cineplex operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). While I benefited in the past from AMC stock, I no longer own any shares. Frankly, I\u2019m glad that I got out of it given the severe deterioration of market value. Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped the speculation.\n\nSo, could AMC make another magical run higher? First, I believe we must acknowledge the ardent support that the cineplex specialist attracts. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything like it so you can\u2019t count it out. Second, the bears appear to be betting against the enterprise, which theoretically could spark a short squeeze. For example, AMC\u2019s short interest comes in at 9.62% of its float, which is elevated.\n\nHowever, the bigger catalyst may come from the derivatives market. Fintel\u2019s options flow shows heavy volume of sold calls. At face value, these are bets that the underlying security won\u2019t rise above the listed strike price.\n\nFurther, some of these short calls \u2013 such as the Feb. 6 transaction for the Feb 23 \u201924 4.50 Call \u2013 show huge discrepancies between high volume and relatively low open interest. That could mean an aggressively bearish (perhaps naked?) short call. If so, it\u2019s off to the races but this is also an extremely risky bet.\n\nStory continues\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) A photo of Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson\n\nSource: Brian Friedman / Shutterstock.com\n\nWithin the past six months, spaceflight specialist Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) has been all over the map. From August through late October, SPCE tumbled badly. However, from October to late December, SPCE managed to close near the $3 level. That signaled that the bulls have taken control of the market. Alas, it was a trap. Since the beginning of the new year, SPCE cratered, down about 26%.\n\nFundamentally, though, Virgin Galactic \u2013 all other things being equal \u2013 enjoys a burgeoning total addressable market. For instance, Spherical Insights reports that the global space exploration market size reached a valuation of $486 billion in 2022. By 2032, the sector could hit nearly $1.88 trillion. If so, that would translate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.21%.\n\nAnd that adds some \u201ccredibility\u201d if you will to SPCE\u2019s short-squeeze prospects. Right now, its short interest as a percentage of float stands at 22.18%. Also, its short interest ratio lands at 11.72 days to cover. On the options flow side, bears have placed both short and long-expiry sold calls and bought puts.\n\nTo be blunt, I\u2019m not a big fan of SPCE\u2019s wildness. Still, if you have the nerve, it could be one of the meme stocks to buy.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) logo in front of stock market price graph\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is the one that started it all and coincidentally one of the few meme stocks to buy that I have in my portfolio. At first, GameStop (NYSE:GME) was like any other brick-and-mortar retailer fading away in the swamp of American open-air shopping centers. However, with competition moving in via e-commerce outlets combined with gaming console manufacturers facilitating direct-buy opportunities, GameStop days appeared to be numbered.\n\nStill, that was before short squeezes became part of the mainstream lexicon. I suppose that\u2019s the enduring legacy of GME. We as a financial publication industry routinely cover short squeezes. Heck, I even use short squeezes in my personal options trading. And the phenomenon is so powerful \u2013 that is forcing the bears to cover their positions \u2013 that even when you make an administrative mistake, the squeeze can potentially bail you out.\n\nCan the same happen again for GME? I wouldn\u2019t count it out. Fintel shows that its short interest as a percentage of float clocks in at 22.49%. Also, its short interest ratio stand at 22.17 days to cover. Recently, bearish traders have sold GME calls that expire on Feb. 16.\n\nGiven that there\u2019s shorting activities going on in both the open and derivatives markets, all it takes is a push in the \u201cright\u201d direction. Is it one of the meme stocks to buy? Ya know, it very well could be.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in GME. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
