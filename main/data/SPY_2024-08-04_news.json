More alarmingly, the unemployment rate increased from 4.1% to 4.3%.\n\nAs a result, market-implied probabilities over a 50-basis-point cut in September have spiked to 73%, according to CME Group FedWatch tool.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has entered a correction phase after surpassing a 10% drawdown since its July peak. Mega-cap, high-quality tech stocks offered no refuge to investors, as the Magnificent Seven giants all suffered losses except for Apple Inc., buoyed by an upbeat earnings report. Collectively, the Magnificent Seven lost over $300 billion in market value on Friday alone.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), popularly known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, surged over 30% to reach the high-20 levels.\n\nSmall caps were again the weakest segment of the market, given their heightened sensitivity to economic fundamentals. The Russell 2000 tumbled over 3%, extending declines after a 3.4% loss on Thursday.\n\nConsumer discretionary and technology were the worst-performing sectors, while semiconductors led the selloff among industries. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) plummeted over 5%, marking a double-digit loss in the last two sessions, its worst performance since March 2020.\n\nNvidia Corp. fell an additional 3.4% following a 6.7% decline on Thursday, as the chipmaker came under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for potential antitrust violations.\n\nTreasuries were the biggest gainers among major assets, reflecting a broad-based flight-to-quality sentiment. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rallied 2.9%, its strongest performance since the U.S. regional bank crisis in March 2023.\n\nThe Japanese yen also gained significantly, with the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXY) up 1.8%.\n\nGold edged down slightly by 0.6%, while oil prices fell more than 4% for the day, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude retreating to $72 a barrel.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell over 3%.\n\nFriday\u2019s Performance In US Major Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day Chg % Dow Jones 39,492.36 -2.1% S&P 500 5,321.21 -2.3% Nasdaq 100 18,355.31 -2.8% Russell 2000 2,110.14 -3.4%\n\nUpdated at 1:05 p.m. ET\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 2.2% lower to $531.13.

This broad tech rally was propelled by a sharp rebound in chipmakers, buoyed by robust corporate earnings and easing concerns over chip export restrictions to China.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at 5.25-5.50%, but market attention is fixed on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET, for any hints of a potential rate cut in September, which market participants have fully priced in.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 surged 2.7%, with 87 of its constituents in positive territory, led by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), which jumped 11%. The tech-heavy index hasn\u2019t experienced such a rally since February 2024.\n\nThe Biden administration is planning to introduce new regulations next month to restrict the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese chipmakers, with key allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea being exempt, according to Reuters.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) soared over 5%, also marking its strongest session since late February 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 also posted solid gains, rising 1.6%. Small caps, tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), increased by 1.1%, eyeing their highest close since January 2022. Blue chips climbed 0.7%.\n\nThe dollar eased 0.2%, weighed down by a disappointing July private employment report released earlier by the ADP. The Japanese yen, tracked by the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXE), rallied 1.4% following an overnight rate hike by the Bank of Japan.\n\nIn commodities, gold rose 0.7%, surpassing $2,400 per ounce, and silver climbed 1.4%.

It expects to ship chips for over 100 million AI PCs by 2025, including over 40 million in 2024.\n\nIn the\u00a0second quarter of 2024, DNB Asset Management, with AUM of $88 billion, more than doubled its investment in Intel.\n\nIntel stock lost 8% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).\n\nIntel Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nIntel\u2019s revenue growth in FY23 was -14.0%, reflecting the influence of various factors including the macroeconomic environment, demand for its products and services, and its position relative to competitors. This growth is a critical indicator for investors assessing the company\u2019s future prospects.\n\nSome macro factors that could impact the company's performance in the next year include higher interest rates, progress on reeling in inflation and labor market strength. The Fed's benchmark rate is currently at 5.33%, while PPI recently came in at 0.2%, growing 2.6% from last year. The unemployment rate was most recently reported as 4.1%.\n\nAn investor should pay attention to economic conditions to decide whether they think the macro environment is positive or negative for Intel stock.

        "content": "You Could Have Turned $500 Into More Than $50,000 In One Day As Market Got Clobbered: Here's How\n\nWednesday was the worst day for the overall market in 2024, with the SPDR S&P 500 Index (NYSE:SPY) trading down more than 2% and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NYSE:QQQ) trading down more than 3.5% late in the session.\r\n\r\nMany mega-cap tech names that have driven much of the last year's rally sold off significantly on the day, with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) each trading down more than 5%.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nHere\u2019s how much you should have invested in Nvidia in 2022 to become a millionaire today. This platform is offering 8.1% APY on idle cash and up to 15 FREE Stocks with qualified deposits for a limited time.\n\nBut, even when the market gets hammered, there are ways to make money. Short-dated options contracts are a risky way to play the market, but when they go right, they can be a vehicle to make large gains very quickly.\n\nOn Tuesday, put contracts on the QQQs with a strike price of $469 that expired Wednesday afternoon closed at $.05 a contract, according to Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD). At the time, the QQQs were trading at more than $480 a share, making it very unlikely that the index would trade below the strike price.\n\nAt their highs on Wednesday, those same contracts that would have cost $5 on Tuesday, were worth more than $510 a pop. This means that 100 contracts of those specific puts could have been purchased for $500 on Tuesday, and sold for more than $50,000 on Wednesday, good for a gain of more than 9,900%.\n\nTrending:\n\nEnjoy freedom to trade from market hours with this revolutionary platform allowing 24-hour trading access. Tauted as being one of the most budget-friendly premium options tradings, it now offers zero contract fees on equity options and a bonus of 5 free stocks\n\nPut contracts give the buyer the right to sell the underlying equity (in this case 100 shares of the QQQs) at the predetermined strike price, regardless of where the stock is trading, up until the expiration date. With Wednesday's wicked red day, well outside the standard deviation move of the overall market, those put contracts exploded in price.\n\nTypically, the $SPY or $QQQs don't move more than 2% in a single day. But, because Tuesday afternoon featured earnings reports from two of the biggest holdings in each index (Tesla and Google) there was an extra catalyst, making the market prime for a larger-than-expected move.\n\nNot to mention the fact that the rapid rise of volatility on Wednesday also increased the value of the contracts. When the VIX (an indicator of market volatility) goes higher, so does the underlying value of options contracts. This is because the increased volatility makes it more likely that a stock could hit the strike price associated with the options contract.\r\n\r\nRead Next:\n\nStory continues\n\nHere\u2019s how much you should have invested in Nvidia in 2022 to become a millionaire today.

Reports indicated Nvidia collaborating with Inspur, a key distribution partner in China, to introduce and distribute the new chip, tentatively named \"B20,\" which is part of Nvidia's \"Blackwell\" series.\n\nThe chip stocks also got a boost from China, which lowered key interest rates. China is a key AI chip market. However, it faces several economic challenges, including weak growth in the second quarter and looming deflation.\n\nOn Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced that it would cut the seven-day reverse repo rate to 1.7% from 1.8% and reduce the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.35% from 3.45%. Additionally, Reuters reports that China lowered the five-year LPR to 3.85% from 3.95%.\n\nPrice Actions: At the last check on Monday, NVDA was up 1.76% at $120 premarket.

The Russell 2000 Index, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), has had its best week of the year, gaining over 6%.\n\nEach of the eleven S&P 500 sectors showed a gain Friday, with the index of the 500 largest U.S. corporations rising 0.9%. For the S&P 500, this marks the tenth positive week out of the last twelve.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 also showed a solid rebound, rising by 1% after a 2.2% selloff the previous day.\n\nOn the macro front, producer inflation rose more than expected in June. However, this did not affect expectations for rate cuts, with traders firmly anticipating a cut in September, assigning it a near-certain probability.\n\nThe consumer sentiment index measured by the University of Michigan continues to show signs of weakness in July, though it also indicates a decrease in future inflation expectations.\n\nMajor banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings, yet market reactions were negative, particularly for Wells Fargo amid a weakening outlook on net interest income.\n\nTreasury yields were steady, with the 10-year yield hovering at 4.20%, on track for the lowest close since late March.

These reactions suggest that market participants had likely already priced in rate cut expectations into tech stock valuations and are now rotating from top-performing sectors to laggards.\n\nThe outperformance of the S&P 500 real estate sector over tech by more than 5 percentage points marked the largest one-day relative change in over four years, indicating a potential sectoral shift.\n\nOther assets making significant moves included small caps, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) up 3.3%, its strongest one-day return since mid-December 2023; gold, up 1.7%; and long-dated Treasury bonds, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rallying 1.5%.\n\nEquity industries showing notable growth were those positively impacted by the prospects of lower interest rates. Homebuilders, tracked by the SPDR Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB), were up 6.7% for the day, their strongest one-day performance since mid-December 2023.

        "content": "Nvidia Could Generate $12B In China With New AI Chips That Comply With US Restrictions: Report (CORRECTED)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The headline and third paragraph of this story has been updated to more accurately depict the nature of Nvidia\u2019s sales of AI chips in China to comply with US export controls.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on track to sell $12 billion of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite the U.S. export controls, the Financial Times reports.\n\nAccording to analyst forecasts, the company will deliver more than 1 million new H20 chips, designed to comply with U.S. restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers.\n\nThat figure is nearly double what Huawei is expected to sell for its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, the FT cites SemiAnalysis, chip consultancy estimates.\n\nEach H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting Nvidia could generate over $12 billion in sales, surpassing the $10.3 billion revenue from its entire China business in the previous financial year.\n\nColette Kress, Nvidia\u2019s finance chief, noted a significant decline in revenue from its data center segment in China following the imposition of new export controls in October.\n\nBefore U.S. export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia\u2019s total revenues. Even if the H20 chip meets analysts\u2019 expectations, China may account for about 10% of sales this year.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis report that the H20 chip is now shipping in volume and is popular among Chinese customers despite its lower performance than Nvidia\u2019s US-sold chips.\n\nMost Chinese AI companies have built their AI models on Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem, making a switch to Huawei\u2019s infrastructure time-consuming and costly.\n\nDespite the restrictions, Nvidia\u2019s overall revenues from China, including Hong Kong, grew more than 50% year-on-year to $2.5 billion in the most recent quarter.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is under scrutiny because of reports of its advanced AI chips being smuggled into China.\n\nAround 12,500 AI chips are estimated to be smuggled annually, while Nvidia sold over 2.6 million A100 and H100 chips globally last year.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 203% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to Nvidia through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA shares were trading lower by 0.76% at $127.40 premarket at the last check on Friday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Nvidia Could Generate $12B In China With New AI Chips That Comply With US Restrictions: Report (CORRECTED) originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

What's Going On?\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on track to sell $12 billion of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite the U.S. export controls, the Financial Times reports.\n\nAccording to analyst forecasts, the company will deliver more than 1 million new H20 chips, designed to circumvent U.S. restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers.\n\nThat figure is nearly double what Huawei is expected to sell for its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, the FT cites SemiAnalysis, chip consultancy estimates.\n\nEach H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting Nvidia could generate over $12 billion in sales, surpassing the $10.3 billion revenue from its entire China business in the previous financial year.\n\nColette Kress, Nvidia\u2019s finance chief, noted a significant decline in revenue from its data center segment in China following the imposition of new export controls in October.\n\nBefore U.S. export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia\u2019s total revenues. Even if the H20 chip meets analysts\u2019 expectations, China may account for about 10% of sales this year.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis report that the H20 chip is now shipping in volume and is popular among Chinese customers despite its lower performance than Nvidia\u2019s US-sold chips.\n\nMost Chinese AI companies have built their AI models on Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem, making a switch to Huawei\u2019s infrastructure time-consuming and costly.\n\nDespite the restrictions, Nvidia\u2019s overall revenues from China, including Hong Kong, grew more than 50% year-on-year to $2.5 billion in the most recent quarter.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is under scrutiny because of reports of its advanced AI chips being smuggled into China.\n\nAround 12,500 AI chips are estimated to be smuggled annually, while Nvidia sold over 2.6 million A100 and H100 chips globally last year.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 203% in the last 12 months.

The iShares Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) fell by 1.3%.\n\nSemiconductors are set to experience their second consecutive week of losses, while regional banks shine, with the SPDRS&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) potentially marking its best weekly performance since the beginning of the year.\n\nMajor commodities are little changed, with gold flat and oil down by 0.5%.

        "content": "Wall Street Wavers, Nvidia Resumes Losses, Tesla Eyes 4-Month High Close, Amazon Hits $2 Trillion Value: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nWall Street experienced a mixed session on Wednesday, as investors adopted a cautious stance following Tuesday\u2019s gains while awaiting key economic data releases later this week, including the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation report due on Friday.\n\nAt noon in New York, major U.S. averages traded flat, showing a lack of direction. Notably, 10 out of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were in the red, with consumer discretionary being the only sector to post gains. Small caps fell by 0.3%, while blue chips edged up by 0.1%.\n\nThe semiconductor industry failed to continue its rebound, as the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) dropped 1%, with Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) down 2%.\n\nTreasury yields rose, particularly at the long end of the curve, with both 10-year and 30-year yields increasing by 5-6 basis points, as traders slightly trimmed bets on a September rate cut.\n\nThe dollar gained further traction against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. dollar index (DXY) eyeing its highest close since April 30.\n\nNotably, the dollar-yen pair rose past 160, marking the weakest level for the Japanese currency since December 1987, as traders continued to test Bank of Japan\u2019s policies.\n\nCommodities were softer overall, with gold retracing 0.9% amid higher yields and a stronger greenback, natural gas dropping 2.7%, while oil prices edged up by only 0.2%.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was 1% lower at $61,150, failing to sustain Tuesday\u2019s 2.5% rise.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance In US Major Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Dow Jones 39,157.26 0.1% S&P 500 5,469.79 0.0% Nasdaq 100 19,702.27 0.0% Russell 2000 2,019.85 -0.4%\n\nUpdated at 1:10 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to\u00a0Benzinga Pro\u00a0data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was flat at $544.86. The\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA)\u00a0was 0.1% higher to $391.47. The tech-heavy\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust (ARCA:\u00a0QQQ) was 0.1% higher to $479.66. Sector-wise, the\u00a0Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY)\u00a0outperformed, up by 1.4%, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) lagged, falling 0.9%.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 3.8% eyeing the highest close since March 1. Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro initiated coverage on Tesla late Tuesday with a Buy rating, setting a price target of $265. Amazon.com Inc. also rallied 3.8% to $220, reaching the $2 trillion market valuation mark. Bank of America raised price target on the retail giant from $210 to $220. Rivian Automotive Inc.

        "content": "5 Charts Expose Troubling Weaknesses In Record-High Stock Market: 'This Is Not Normal'\n\nAs the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices continue to notch new all-time highs, it\u2019s clear that the rising tide has not lifted all boats.\n\nSharp-eyed analysts and investors have noted some discordant features in a stock market at its peak, raising questions about the euphoria that currently reigns supreme on Wall Street.\n\nMega-Cap Dominance Unprecedented Since Late 2008\n\nThe dominance of mega-cap stocks hasn\u2019t been this pronounced in nearly sixteen years.\n\nThe top 100 U.S. stocks by market capitalization, monitored through the iShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE:OEF), have never been stronger against the Russell 1000 Index, as tracked by the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (NYSE:IWB), since December 2008-.\n\nDavid Morrison, senior market Analyst at Trade Nation, commented, \u201cThere are concerns about the US market's lack of breadth with so much of the overall performance concentrated in the stock price of a few corporations. In fact, the five biggest companies by market capitalization in the S&P 500 account for nearly 30% of its value. The size and outperformance of this select group is reflected in its valuation, which is way above that of the rest of the constituents.\u201d\n\nPoor Participation In Market Rally\n\nThe current bull market rally lacks broad participation, with only a few companies driving the major indices higher.\n\nThe cap-weighted S&P 500 Index, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), has surged to levels last seen in November 2008 when compared to its equally-weighted counterpart, represented by the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP).\n\n\u201cWe haven't had a four-week span where the US stock market has gone up so much with so many stocks within the market going down, based on data going back to 2002,\u201d said Luke Kawa, markets editor at Sherwood.\n\nSentimenTrader in a post on social media X, indicates that while the Nasdaq 100 continues to achieve record highs, many of its constituent stocks are underperforming, dropping to monthly, quarterly, or even yearly lows and falling below their 10-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages.\n\n\u201cThis is not normal. In fact, it\u2019s never happened before to this degree. There is a possibility that the average stock will catch up to the index, that is not how things usually pan out. Almost never, in fact. Risk is high in that index,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 continues to notch record high after record high. Many of its stocks are not only lagging, but they're falling to monthly, quarterly, or even yearly lows and below their 10-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages.\r\n\r\nThis is not normal. In fact, it's never happened before... pic.twitter.com/gopsw8WUJn\n\n\u2014 SentimenTrader (@sentimentrader) June 17, 2024\n\nTech Supremacy Surpassing Historical Extremes\n\nThe tech sector has been the primary driver of the extreme relative valuations among major U.S. stock indices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nasdaq 100, when compared to both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000, is at historic highs, surpassing previous peaks seen during the dot-com bubble and in December 2021 at the end of the ultra-low interest rate era.\n\nRead now: US Budget Crunch: CBO Warns Federal Interest Costs Now Higher Than Defense Spending, Deficits To Remain Above 5.5% Until 2034\n\nImage created using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article 5 Charts Expose Troubling Weaknesses In Record-High Stock Market: 'This Is Not Normal' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 Dip From Record Highs As Investors Take Chipmaker Profits; Energy Sector Rebounds, Yields Rise: What's Driving Markets Thursday?\n\nAfter the Juneteenth holiday break, Wall Street reopened with a cautious tone, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices declined after hitting all-time highs around midday trading in New York. This decline was driven by profit-taking in chipmaker stocks and rising Treasury yields, which dampened risk sentiment.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) fell by 2.4%, marking its worst session since May 1, after reaching technically \u201coverbought\u201d levels earlier in the week.\n\nOil prices surged above $81 a barrel, aiming for the highest close since late April. This was spurred by larger-than-expected drops in U.S. inventories last week, fueling a rally in oil-related companies.\n\nSmall caps also softened, whereas blue chips saw a rebound, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperforming other major indices with a 0.4% gain.\n\nLong-dated Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield up by 5 basis points to 4.27%, following mixed economic data released earlier in the day. Jobless claims slightly increased more than expected last week, and a manufacturing activity gauge in the Philadelphia region fell short of estimates, reaching its lowest level in five months.\n\nAdditionally, housing data showed sharp declines in both housing starts and building permits, reigniting concerns about a tight real estate market.\n\nBonds fell, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) down 0.9%. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) rose 0.4%, with the greenback gaining ground against all major currencies.\n\nThe Bank of England kept its key policy rate unchanged at 5.25%, as expected, while the Swiss National Bank cut rates by 0.25 percentage points to 1.25%. Consequently, the British pound and the Swiss franc fell by 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively, against the dollar.\n\nGold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), rose by 1.1%, while Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) remained flat below $65,000.\n\nMonday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Dow Jones 38,982.71 0.4% S&P 500 5,477.61 -0.2% Russell 2000 2,020.24 -0.3% Nasdaq 100 19,793.76 -0.6%\n\nUpdated at 12:55 pm ET\n\nAccording to\u00a0Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 0.3% lower to $547.24. The\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA)\u00a0was 0.4% higher to $390.90. The tech-heavy\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust (ARCA:\u00a0QQQ) was 0.6% lower to $482.43. Sector-wise, the\u00a0Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE)\u00a0outperformed, up by 1.8%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) lagged, falling 0.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest company Nvidia Corp. witnessed a 2% decline, while Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) and Wolfspeed Inc. (NASDAQ:WOLF) all tumbled by over 5%. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) surged nearly 4%, outperforming all other chipmakers. This rise followed the announcement that Sun Singapore Systems, the largest parking solutions provider in Singapore, has selected AMD to power its AI-based parking management platform. Solar-related stocks experienced sharp declines after JPMorgan reduced price targets on Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) from $128 to $124 and on SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) from $73 to $59. Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) soared over 8% after the company announced that a twice-yearly antiviral injection had successfully prevented HIV in all test subjects during a trial involving thousands of women and girls in South Africa and Uganda. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) rose over 6%, despite missing both revenue and earnings estimate last quarter.

        "content": "Jobless Claims Exceed Estimates, Philly Fed Index Declines, Housing Starts And Permits Fall Sharply: Thursday's Economic Digest\n\nEconomic data released Thursday morning revealed slightly higher-than-expected weekly unemployment claims, sharp contractions in housing starts and building permits, and a drop in a business outlook survey within the Philadelphia Federal Reserve District.\n\nThursday\u2019s Economic Releases: Key Highlights\n\nThe number of people filing for jobless claims in the U.S. fell by 5,000 to 238,000 in the week ending June 15, slightly exceeding market expectations of 235,000 as tracked by Econoday. The four-week moving average for initial claims, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, increased from 227,250 to 232,750, marking the highest level since September 2023. In May 2024, housing starts saw a significant decline, dropping 5.5% month-over-month to an annualized rate of 1.27 million. This was a decrease from a revised 1.352 million in April and fell short of the 1.37 million forecast. Single-family housing starts decreased by 5.2% to 982,000, while starts for buildings with five or more units were at 278,000. Building permits also dropped by 3.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.386 million in May 2024, down from 1.44 million in April, the lowest level since June 2020 and below the expected 1.45 million. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's general activity index fell by 3 points to 1.3 in June, the lowest since January 2024 and below the forecast of 5.2. The current shipments index decreased by 6 points to -7.2, its lowest since December. The new orders index, while still negative, improved from -7.9 in May to -2.2 in June. The employment index rose but remained negative for the eight straight month, indicating a continued overall decline in employment levels. Regarding prices, both price indexes suggested ongoing overall price increases. The prices paid index rose 4 points to 22.5, while the current prices received index soared 7 points to 13.7. Most future activity indicators stayed positive but pointed to less widespread expectations for growth over the next six months.\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nTreasury yields witnessed a slight uptick following the releases, with the 10-year yield rising from 4.23% to 4.26%.\n\nThe rate-sensitive 2-year yield, meanwhile, held steady at 4.73%.\n\nThe greenback held session gains, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), as tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), up 0.3% for the day.\n\nFutures on major U.S. equity indices traded higher during the premarket trading on Thursday. Contracts on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were 0.3% and 0.4% higher, respectively, yet they marginally trimmed gains following the data.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Tuesday, both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), closed at record highs, driven by outperformance of the technology sector.\n\nRead Next:Wall Street On Track To Resume Meteoric Climb, Nvidia Builds On Gains: Analyst Says \u2018Now Until Later In The Month Is...Seasonally Worst Times\u2019\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Jobless Claims Exceed Estimates, Philly Fed Index Declines, Housing Starts And Permits Fall Sharply: Thursday's Economic Digest originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The declining short interest in SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to successive record lows has been supporting US equities and reducing volatility over the past year, thus serving as an implicit short volatility (vol) trade, JPMorgan strategists said in a Thursday note.\n\nSPY and QQQ, major vehicles for placing index-level positions on US equities, have seen their declining short interest bolster US equity indices as investors gradually covered their short positions.\n\n\u201cIn turn this steady flow support from the gradual covering of short positions has suppressed realized vol, creating additional space to take bigger equity positions in notional terms,\u201d strategists noted.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the declining short interest over the past year in these two major ETFs has become the equivalent of an implicit short vol trade,\u201d they added.\n\nHowever, with short interest at historically low levels, this extended implicit short vol trade poses a vulnerability to US equities if negative news reverses the decline in short interest, they added.\n\nThe declining short interest at the index level poses a question of whether this trend corresponds to rising short interest in individual stocks. However, data does not support this hypothesis, JPMorgan highlights.\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis indicates no significant increase in short interest over the past year for individual stocks, whether examining the largest tech companies or the broader S&P 500 universe.\n\n\u201cThe declining short in SPY and QQQ ETFs does not only reflect a net increase in US equity exposure by hedge funds over the past year, but also a shrinkage of short sellers,\u201d strategists continued.\n\nThey believe this shrinkage is driven by difficulties in maintaining short positions in a rising market, regulatory transparency increasing shorting costs, and active retail investor engagement deterring short sellers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJPM: Record low short interest in SPY, QQQ may expose US equities to vulnerability\n\nHoneywell to buy aerospace and defense firm CAES Systems for $1.9 billion\n\nVanda rejects Future Pak and Cycle Pharma's takeover offers\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Sizzling Moment For Stocks? S&P 500's Path To 5,600 'Achievable During Summer Rally,' Says Wall Street Analyst\n\nAs summer heats up, so does the stock market. The S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), has an intriguing historical seasonality pattern during presidential election years.\n\nLooking back to 1928, an analysis conducted by Bank of America shows that the S&P 500 often kicks off summer with a solid performance in early June, which sets a bullish tone that tends to carry through the summer months.\n\n\u201cA late June lull could set up an early July rally,\u201d says Stephen Suttmeier, CFA, CMT, an analyst at Bank of America.\n\nHistorical data underscores this trend: the last 10 sessions of June have shown uninspiring results, with the S&P 500 up only 48% of the time and an average return of just 0.02% (-0.19% median).\n\nThis means that during the final days of June, the market\u2019s performance has historically been lackluster, with nearly half the days seeing slight losses. But this pause can be the calm before the storm, setting the stage for the strongest 10-day period of the year in early July.\n\nBut this pause can be a prelude to a significant upswing, setting the stage for the strongest 10-day period of the year in early July.\n\nDuring this period, the S&P 500 has seen average returns of 1.54% and median returns of 1.91%. In simpler terms, early July has historically been a very good time for the stock market.\n\nJuly and August: The Summer Rally Peaks\n\nWhen it comes to presidential election years, the market\u2019s behavior is even more pronounced as July and August typically yield positive returns.\n\nThe first 10 days of August are particularly strong, with the S&P 500 averaging a 1.53% gain. This is only slightly less than the 1.59% gain recorded in the first 10 days of June \u2014 historically the best window in election years.\n\n\u201cThe SPX has continued to new all-time highs into mid-June, with the next major technical milestone being the 2022-2023 bullish cup and handle count in the 5600s, achievable during a summer rally,\u201d Suttmeier wrote.\n\nA \u201cbullish cup and handle\u201d is a technical chart pattern that suggests a potential for further gains.\n\nIt looks like a teacup on a chart, with a rounded bottom (the cup) and a slight downward drift (the handle). If this pattern holds, the S&P 500 could reach new highs in the 5600 range, indicating a strong summer rally.\n\nS&P 500 Summer Seasonality: All Years\n\n10-day Window Month Average Return Median Return Percentage of \r\npositive returns First 10 days June 0.67% 1.03% 60% Last 10 days June 0.02% -0.19% 48% First 10 days July 1.54% 1.91% 69% Last 10 days July 0.08% 0.40% 60% First 10 days August 0.23% 0.03% 51% Last 10 days August 0.10% 0.17% 52% First 10 days September -0.36% -0.19% 44% Last 10 days September -1.13% -0.69% 40%\n\nS&P 500 Summer Seasonality: Presidential Election Years\n\n10-day Window Month Average Return Median Return Percentage of \r\npositive returns First 10 days June 1.59% 1.47% 64% Last 10 days June -0.38% 0.52% 54% First 10 days July 0.93% 0.84% 54% Last 10 days July 0.82% 0.37% 63% First 10 days August 1.53% 0.87% 63% Last 10 days August 0.81% -0.01% 50% First 10 days September -0.42% -0.38% 46% Last 10 days September -0.05% -0.05% 46%\n\nMega Caps Lead\n\nAnother key trend highlighted by Bank of America is the overperformance of mega caps relative to large caps.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe S&P 100, which includes the U.S. 100 largest companies and tracked by the iShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE:OEF), rallied 20% year to date, topping the S&P 500\u2019s performance by 4 percentage points and matching that of the Nasdaq 100.\n\nAccording to Suttmeier this is a bullish pattern, suggesting a potential late \u201c1990s-style leadership melt-up\u201d for mega caps compared to large caps. A \u201cmelt-up\u201d refers to a strong market rally driven by a sudden surge in buying, rather than improving fundamentals.\n\nChart: Mega Caps Have Sharply Rallied Versus Large Caps (OEF/SPY Ratio)\n\nRead Now: Google, OpenAI And Other US Tech Giants Tighten Employee Screening Amid Rising Chinese Espionage Fears: Report\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Sizzling Moment For Stocks?

        "content": "Fed Chair Powell Tempers Market Excitement: 'We Want To Gain Further Confidence' On Inflation\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated during his June press conference that policymakers \u201cwant to gain further confidence\u201d on inflation before considering interest rate cuts, slightly dampening market enthusiasm fueled by a lower-than-expected inflation report released earlier Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, the data has not given us that greater confidence. The inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat,\u201d Powell stated.\n\nPowell welcomed today\u2019s reading but warned that upcoming inflation data may be \u201cgood but not [as] great\u201d as the last one, given unfavorable base effects from the second half of 2023 which is likely to affect annual readings.\n\nPowell somehow cooled investor excitement over today\u2019s reading: \u201cThat\u2019s a step in the right direction. But one reading is only one reading.\u201d\n\nRead also: Fed Holds Rates Steady: Projections Show Fewer Rate Cuts, Higher Inflation Outlook\n\nMay Inflation Report Hasn\u2019t Altered Fed\u2019s New Inflation Outlook\n\nPowell explained that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members had the opportunity to update their inflation forecasts in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following the new inflation data for May that was released this morning. However, the outcome of the SEP likely indicates that the majority of members generally left their opinions unchanged.\n\nThe projected median total Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation for this year has risen to 2.6%, an increase from 2.4% in March. Next year\u2019s projection has also risen, now estimated at 2.3%, up from 2.2% in March. The projection for 2026 remains unchanged at 2.0%.\n\nAccording to Powell, conditions in the labor market have returned into better balance, about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, \u201crelatively tight but not overheated.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether a September rate cut is feasible given the prospect of just one rate cut in 2024 (as indicated in the SEP), Powell stressed that any decision will be data-dependent, as the Fed does not make decisions about future meetings until they have all the necessary information.\n\nPowell reiterated: \u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves having the confidence that would warrant loosening policy,\u201d stressing the need to witness further positive inflation data in the coming months.\n\nThe Fed Chair also hinted that an \u201cunexpected weakening in the labor market\u201d would also encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait things to break and then fix them,\u201d Powell said, indicating that the Fed will be highly attentive in monitoring the evolution of labor market data.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nStocks slightly trimmed their session gains, while Treasury yields recovered from the sharp declines experienced earlier in the day, triggered by the May inflation report.\n\nMarket-implied expectations for a September rate cut slightly eased from about 70% to 63%. Traders continue to expect two fully priced rate cuts by December 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.8% higher at 3:30 p.m. ET, easing after hitting all-time highs earlier in the day.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 1.1% higher, cutting gains after it was 1.9% higher at 3:15 p.m. ET.\n\nThe yield on a 2-year Treasury bond traded at 4.76%, rebounding after hitting an intraday level as low as 4.67%.\n\nThe yield on a 10-year Treasury bond was 4.32%, bouncing off an intraday low of 4.25%.\n\nGold, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), erased all session gains, trading flat for the day.\n\nRead now: How May\u2019s Inflation Slowdown Could Influence Fed\u2019s Next Move: Insights From 6 Economists\n\nPhoto: Fed\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Fed Chair Powell Tempers Market Excitement: 'We Want To Gain Further Confidence' On Inflation originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Bulls Push Wall Street To Record Highs On Declining Inflation; Tech, Real Estate, Small Caps Surge Ahead Of Fed Meeting: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nA lower-than-expected inflation report for May ignited a bullish frenzy on Wall Street, with investors increasing their bets on rate cuts, bolstered by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will ease its policy stance later this year as price pressures trend towards the 2% target.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed cooler-than-anticipated monthly and annual inflation rates for both headline and core items.\n\nThis report arrives just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will commence at 2:00 p.m. ET today.\n\nThe implied probability of a rate cut by September has surged to 72%, up from 54% before the inflation report. Fed futures now indicate a 55 basis points reduction (equivalent to two rate cuts) by year-end.\n\nIn response to rising expectations for rate cuts, traders quickly pivoted to riskier assets.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4% to over 19,400 points, setting new record highs. The S&P 500 Index increased by 1.1% to surpass 5,400 points, also achieving fresh all-time highs.\n\nBlue-chip stocks saw a modest rise of 0.2%, but the standout performance came from small caps. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) surged 2.7%, marking its best session since mid-December 2023.\n\nTreasury yields plummeted across the board, with the 2-year yield dropping 15 basis points to 4.68%. Long-dated yields also declined by approximately 10 basis points, propelling the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) up by 1.6%, its strongest one-day performance since early February 2024.\n\nIndustries sensitive to interest rates saw significant gains. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB) and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) soared 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nPrecious metals also rallied on the back of lower yields and a weakening dollar, with gold rising 0.8% and silver surging 2.8%.\n\nCryptocurrencies experienced sharp rallies driven by the risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped 3.6% to $69,800, while the more speculative Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) surged over 8% on the day.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,072.95 2.6% Nasdaq 100 19,471.20 1.4% S&P 500 5,435.07 1.1% Dow Jones 38,819.58 0.2%\n\nUpdated at 12:15 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 1.1% higher to $542.76.

        "content": "What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday?\n\nNvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged to record highs on Wednesday, valuing the company at over $3 trillion and making it the world\u2019s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nNvidia plans a ten-for-one stock split on June 7 to attract more individual investors.\n\nNvidia\u2019s valuation has soared 147% in 2024 due to strong demand for AI processors from companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization, more than the entire value of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Reuters reports.\n\nJake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, remarked, \u201cNvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI.\u201d\n\nNvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang received widespread media coverage at Computex in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple faces weak iPhone demand and stiff competition in China.\n\nAccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices, five companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), account for about 60% of the S&P 500\u2019s total return of over 12% this year. Nvidia alone has contributed roughly a third of this gain, following a 147% surge in 2024.\n\nAngelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, highlighted potential market vulnerability if these key stocks falter and the rest of the market does not provide support.\n\nTajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, expects the earnings gap between the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies and the rest of the S&P 500 to narrow as 2024 progresses.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is preparing to ramp up investments in Taiwan, with plans to build its second supercomputer there. This underscores the importance of crucial supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nNvidia has already tapped Samsung Electronics Co for the supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and is now eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier to overcome the supply chain constraints.\n\nAnalysts reaffirmed Nvidia as the\u00a0lead AI beneficiary\u00a0after the recent Taiwan event, citing opportunities with its Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 217% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA shares traded lower by 0.83% at $1,214.17 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Got Idle Cash Lying Around? These Passive ETFs Could Be The Place To Park It\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFinding a safe, but profitable place for your idle cash can be challenging. \"The market is going to remain choppy,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, \"There are questions as to: Where are we headed? Where's the economy headed?\"\n\nAmid surging economic headwinds and mounting international tensions, investing in passive ETFs that replicate the performance of indexes can be as safe of an investment as there is. In an era where market unpredictability is the norm, passive ETFs offer a stable, low-cost way to grow wealth.\n\nUnlike actively managed funds, which rely on the expertise of a fund manager to select stocks, passive ETFs simply aim to replicate the holdings of their benchmark index. This results in relatively lower fees as well as surmounting diversification benefits.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is one of the most well-known and widely held ETFs in the market. The ETF replicates the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 Index, which tracks the performance of the 500 largest companies in the U.S.\n\nInterestingly, SPY was the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the United States back in 1993, revolutionizing the investment landscape. As of May 30, 2024, the fund's top holdings include some of the most influential and robust companies in the market. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is its largest holding,\u00a0 accounting for 7% of the ETF's portfolio. Other large holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL, accounting for 6.31% of the fund's total portfolio, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), with a 6.20% weightage.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust boasts impressive returns as well. The ETF's year-to-date return stands at 10.3%, slightly higher than the benchmark index's 9.4% returns. Over the past year, SPY has returned 24%, beating the underlying index's 21.8% returns.\n\nShelton NASDAQ-100 Index Investor\n\nThe Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index Investor (NASDAQ:NASDX), named in the Forbes Advisor's 10 best mutual funds for 2024, is a promising passive ETF investment option. With $1.66 billion in total assets under management, the ETF aims to replicate the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, thereby benefiting from the market movements of tech giants and other key players that are at the forefront of innovation and the U.S. economy.\n\nThe fund invests in tech giants and other influential non-financial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, providing investors with a stake in major market players. Interestingly, the Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index adheres to a policy of investing at least 80% of its total assets in stocks that are constituents of the Nasdaq-100 Index.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF's year-to-date return stands at 10.24%, while its one-year return is over 21%. The strong tech sector performance has propelled the Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index's returns over this period, outperforming the overall stock market returns tracked by the S&P 500 index.\n\nVanguard Russell 2000 ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:VTWO) targets the Russell 2000 Index, which consists of 2,000 small-cap companies. This ETF is ideal for investors looking to capitalize on the growth potential of smaller, potentially more agile companies.\n\nThe Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has approximately $9.35 billion in total assets under management. The fund's largest holdings include Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX).\n\nThe Russell 2000 Index is widely regarded as a barometer for small-cap stocks, known for their potential for high growth. Over the past year, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has gained 13.5%, while the benchmark Russell 2000's returns stand at 13.3%.\n\nItching for Higher Returns? Check This out\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks or ETFs... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments. With a low minimum investment of just $1,000, Basecamp Alpine Notes makes it easier than ever to start building a high-yield portfolio.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

The Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP) rose 0.5%, marking its strongest day in a month.\n\nRising yields and a stronger dollar pressured commodities, with gold prices down 1%, oil down 1.3%, and natural gas down 5%.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) dropped 1.5%, echoing Tuesday\u2019s decline.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %Chg  Nasdaq 100 18,812.28 -0.3% S&P 500 5,281.15 -0.5% Dow Jones 38,512.75 -0.9% Russell 2000 2,040.63 -1.2%\n\nUpdated at 12:35 p.m. EDT\n\nAccording to\u00a0Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.6% lower to $526.92 The\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.9% to $385.15 The tech-heavy\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was down by 0.4% to $457.81 The Communication ServicesSelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) minimized losses, down by 0.2%.

        "content": "Magnificent 7 Becomes 'The Magnificent One': Wall Street Guru Hails Single Tech Stock As Market Leader\n\nSeasoned Wall Street investor Ed Yardeni, founder and CEO of Yardeni Research, has boldly rebranded the Magnificent Seven giants as the \u201cMagnificent One,\u201d referring only to Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the key driver of this year\u2019s market gains.\n\nYardeni noted that the semiconductor giant has rallied by 115% year-to-date, more than three times as much as MetaPlatforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) \u2013 the top performer among the \u201cMagnificent Six\u201d \u2013 and more than 10 times as much as the broader S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).\n\n\u201cNvidia is the only clear beneficiary of the AI boom currently because everyone who wants to play has to pay for the company\u2019s expensive GPU chips,\u201d Yardeni said.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the heavy capital expenditures could affect the profitability of Nvidia\u2019s clients, who may not all emerge as winners in the AI competition.\n\nRead also: AI-Driven Rally Set To Expand To Power, Commodities, Utilities: \u2018It\u2019s Not Just About Nvidia Anymore\u2019\n\nChart: Nvidia Plays Its Own League In The Year-To-Date Ranking\n\nEconomic Implications Of The AI Expansion: The Roaring 2020s\n\n\u201cIn our Roaring 2020s scenario, the technology boom should continue to shrug off the Fed and power productivity, economic growth, and the stock market higher.\u201d\n\nYardeni explained that the Fed's monetary policy is only one of several economic drivers, and they won't need to reduce rates to support economic growth if productivity increases.\n\nNvidia recently reported an \u201cincredible earnings report,\u201d with quarterly net income surging from $2.0 billion in the previous year to $14.9 billion.\n\n\u201cThat further confirms our thesis\u201d of a Roaring 2020s scenario, Yardeni said.\n\nThe Wall Street veteran believes the market began to reflect the Roaring 2020s scenario on Nov. 30, 2022, with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Since then, Nvidia has propelled the S&P 500\u2019s semiconductor indexes to new heights.\n\nYardeni assigns a 60% chance to the Roaring 2020s scenario, contrasting with a 20% probability of a \u201c1990s market meltup\u201d and another 20% of a \u201c1970s repeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Roaring 2020s scenario is right on track,\u201d he said.\n\nYardeni\u2019s Roaring 2020s scenario anticipates above-average growth in S&P 500 earnings, GDP, and productivity. Increased productivity is expected to reduce unit labor costs and inflation, continuing a trend that started last year. This ongoing trend, as forecasted, should elevate profit margins to unprecedented levels.\n\nLast week, the veteran investor forecasted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach 60,000 points and the S&P 500 would climb to 8,000 by the decade\u2019s end, assuming the Roaring 2020s scenario materializes.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead now: Dow To Reach 60,000, S&P 500 To Hit 8,000 By 2030 In Wall Street Veteran\u2019s \u2018Roaring 2020s Scenario\u2019\n\nPhoto gguy/Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Magnificent 7 Becomes 'The Magnificent One': Wall Street Guru Hails Single Tech Stock As Market Leader originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "VIX Spikes, Dow Sinks As Inflation Jitters Slaughter Fed Easing Hopes: Traders Now Price In Only One Rate Cut In 2024\n\nMarkets experienced a sharp downturn Thursday afternoon following an initial surge to historic highs in technology-heavy stock indices, driven by Nvidia Corp.\u2018s (NASDAQ:NVDA) spectacular AI-driven earnings report.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the market fear index, surged over 7% after hitting its lowest level since November 2019 earlier in the session.\n\nBlue-chip stocks were particularly affected in a broad sector selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, tracked by the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), was down 1.5% at 3:00 p.m. in New York, on track for its worst performance since March 2023.\n\nBoth the S&P 500, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), and the Nasdaq 100, monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), fell 0.9%.\n\nChipmakers were the only industry in the green, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) up 0.8%, thanks to Nvidia\u2019s 8.7% rally.\n\nChart: Dow Eyes Worst Day In Over A Year\n\nWhat Happened: Sentiment took a hit after S&P Global released its May private sector activity surveys. The Composite PMI Index, a gauge of overall business health, showed the highest expansion rate in two years.\n\nThis might seem like good news, but the devil is in the details.\n\n\u201cInput prices continued to rise sharply in May, with the rate of inflation accelerating to register the second-largest monthly increase seen over the past eight months,\u201d S&P Global reported.\n\nIn particular, manufacturers experienced a steep increase, facing the largest cost rise in a year and a half. This was attributed to higher supplier prices for a wide variety of inputs, including metals, chemicals, plastics, and timber-based products, as well as higher energy and labor costs.\n\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, indicated that selling price inflation has increased, continuing to signal modestly above-target inflation.\n\nHe highlighted that the primary inflationary pressure now originates from manufacturing rather than services. This shift has resulted in elevated rates of inflation for both costs and selling prices compared to pre-pandemic standards, implying that reaching the \u201cFed\u2019s 2% target still seems elusive\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters: Stronger-than-expected business sentiment growth and renewed inflationary concerns pushed Treasury yields up across the board, leading investors to reassess the likelihood of Fed interest rate cuts.\n\nNotably, there has been a significant shift in rate cut expectations. Fed futures are currently pricing in only 34 basis points of rate cuts by year-end, translating to just one rate cut.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile investors had anticipated a rate cut by September as of Wednesday, this expectation has now been postponed to November, according to the CME Group Fed Watch Tool.\n\nThe rate-sensitive two-year Treasury yield leaped by 6 basis points to 4.93%, eyeing the highest close since May 1.\n\nThe dollar was the only gainer among major asset classes, with the Invesco DB USD Bullish Index Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), up 0.2%.\n\nNow Read:Boeing Stock Falls As CFO Forecasts Negative Cash Flow, Delivery Delays Amid Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article VIX Spikes, Dow Sinks As Inflation Jitters Slaughter Fed Easing Hopes: Traders Now Price In Only One Rate Cut In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Black Swan Fund Warns Not To Be Excited For Fed Rate Cuts Since It'll Be When \"The Greatest Credit Bubble In Human History\" Pops\n\nFor investors excited about eventual rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, thinking they'll provide a tail wind for risk assets, a 16 billion dollar hedge fund warns to be mindful of their wish.\n\nMark Spitznagel is the CIO and founder of the hedge fund Universa, which focuses on risk mitigation in the face of a \u2018black swan' event. In an interview with Reuters, Spitznagel calls hopes for a rate cut \"a case of be careful what you wish for.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban, opens a round for regular investors at $250. Startup behind \u2018the #1 free contractor app' grows 162% YoY, opens its doors for investors at a $100 minimum.\n\nNassim Nicholas Taleb, who wrote a book on the topic of black swans right before the 2008 financial crisis and is an advisor to the Universa fund, defines a black swan event as being \"so rare that even the possibility that it might occur is unknown,\" while having \"a catastrophic impact when it does occur\" that can be \"explained in hindsight as if it were actually predictable.\"\n\nPart of Mr. Spitznagel's fears stem from how the economy has been conditioned over so many years, benefiting from massive amounts of debt taken out when interest rates were low. He argues that \"this economy is built on low interest rates,\" with \"lag effects when you reset interest rates like we had.\"\n\nWhile investors who have held on to risk assets have benefited from the massive 27% rise in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) since its October 2023 lows, Mark Spitznagel warns that it could reverse quickly, saying \"the fastest, greatest tightening ever, by some regards, into the greatest credit bubble in human history\" is inevitable and that \"when things are going to be really bad [it'll probably be] too late to get out.\"\n\nTrending: Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women\u2019s health problem at 80 cents per share.\n\nMr. \u200b\u200bSpitznagel isn't alone in his concerns about a market getting ahead of itself.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, market strategists at Stifel Investment Bank predict \"a middle quarters correction for equities\" of 10% due to Fed cuts pushed back even further than expected in the face of continued higher-than-expected inflation.\n\nEven Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) has been a net seller of stocks of late as they've gone up, predicting at Berkshire's most recent shareholder meeting that Berkshire's cash position will \"probably be at about $200 billion at the end of this quarter\" due to \"only swing[ing] at pitches we like.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, just because a black swan fund founder sounds the alarm doesn't necessarily mean he's saying to sell everything. Instead, he's warning to be mindful of purchasing portfolio \"insurance,\" such as his fund offers. Mr. Spitznagel assures: \"I\u2019m not a permabear. I\u2019ve been as positive on this market as I could possibly have been in the last year and a half.\"\n\nMr. Spitznagel has said that his strategy of tail-risk hedging is misunderstood, and that \"the entire point of it is that [clients] can be longer\" on their stock positions to benefit from potential price appreciation while remaining protected from extreme downside.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nA groundbreaking energy company plugs into the $400 billion EV industry and is seeking investors.

        "content": "'Big Short' Investor Michael Burry Bets Heavy On Gold, Renewable Energy Stocks, Exits Amazon, Alphabet\n\nMichael Burry, the legendary investor who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis, has once again made headlines with his latest 13F filing for his hedge fund Scion Asset Management LLC.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 reveals a strategic recalibration towards physical commodities and renewable energy, while Burry shifted away from some tech giants.\n\nThe total market value of Scion's 13F securities increased from $94.6 million to $103.49 million. The fund\u2019s activity included five new purchases, additions to 11 existing positions, and complete sell-offs of 14 stocks.\n\nTop 5 Buys: A Golden Bet On Gold And Clean Energy\n\nBurry's top buys for Q1 2024 reveal a clear pivot towards physical precious metals and clean energy, underscoring his anticipation of rising value in these sectors.\n\nLeading the charge is the Sprott Physical Gold Trust ETV (NYSE:PHYS), with Scion increasing its position by $7.62 million, marking a 7.37% change in the portfolio. This substantial investment highlights Burry's confidence in gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty. The aforementioned gold fund has delivered a 16% return year to date, outperforming the broader stock market, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which rose by 12%.\n\nNext in line is Cigna Holding Co (NYSE:CL), where Scion increased its stake by $7.26 million, representing a 7.02% portfolio change. This move reflects Burry's continued belief in the resilience and growth potential of the healthcare sector.\n\nReflecting confidence in the energy sector, Burry added $6.59 million worth of BP Plc ADR (NYSE:BP), translating to a 6.37% portfolio change. This investment signifies Burry\u2019s recognition of BP\u2019s strong position in the global energy market, especially amid BP\u2019s transition to cleaner energy sources.\n\nLast week, the British energy company\u2019s electric vehicle charging unit announced plans to acquire Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) supercharging sites in the US as part of its expansion efforts.\n\nBurry's commitment to renewable energy is further emphasized by a $5.06 million increase in First Solar Inc. (NYSE:FSLR), representing a 4.89% change in the portfolio. This move aligns with the global shift towards sustainable energy solutions, showcasing Burry's foresight in capitalizing on this growing trend.\n\nRounding out the top five buys is Baidu Inc ADR (NASDAQ:BIDU), with a $4.38 million addition, marking a 4.07% portfolio change. This investment underscores Burry\u2019s confidence in the long-term potential of Chinese technology companies.\n\nIn his Q4 2023 13F filing, Burry increased stakes in two major Chinese retail giants, JD.com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba Group Holdings (NASDAQ:BABA).\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of the first quarter 2024, Burry further increased his stakes in these two giants, purchasing an additional 160,000 shares of JD.com and 50,000 shares of Alibaba.\n\nTop 5 Portfolio Divestments: Burry Trims Tech Giants\n\nBurry made notable divestments in several high-profile tech stocks during the first quart.\n\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ:ORCL) tops the list, with Scion decreasing its holdings by $5.77 million, a 5.57% change in the portfolio.\n\nCVS Health Corp (CVS) followed closely, with a $5.62 million reduction, a 5.43% change in the portfolio. This move might reflect concerns over potential challenges in the healthcare sector.\n\nNexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) ranked third in terms of largest sales, with Burry reducing the stake by $5.57 million (5.39% change).\n\nNotably, Burry opted to completely exit his positions in two major U.S. tech giants, suggesting a reevaluation of their growth prospects following a strong rally.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a full divestment, with Burry selling $5.35 million worth of shares (a 5.17% change).\n\nSimilarly,\u00a0Amazon.com\u00a0Inc. (AMZN) experienced a complete exit, with a $4.99 million reduction, representing a 4.82% portfolio change. This move highlights Burry's cautious stance on the future performance of one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms.\n\nPortfolio Summary\n\nThe top five holdings by weight in the Scion Asset Management LLC\u2019s portfolio by the end of the Q1 2024 are:\n\nJD.com Inc: 9.53%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd: by 8.74%. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA): 8.06%. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C): 7.64%.

Cumulatively, traders are now fully pricing in two rate cuts of 25 basis points by year end.\n\nThe rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields tumbled to 4.75%, down by 7 basis points, marking a notable break below its 200-day moving average.\n\nThe U.S. dollar fell across the board vis-\u00e0-vis other major currencies, with the greenback losing as much as 1% against the low-yielding Japanese yen.\n\nAmong sectors, both tech and real estate rallied the most, given their high sensitivity to interest rates. Top industry performers were homebuilders, as tracked by the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE:ITB), up 3.2%. Chipmakers, as tracked by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) followed suit, up 2.2%.\n\nSmall caps, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), also rallied, up by 1%.\n\nMeme-tied stocks, such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Inc. (NYSE:GME), plummeted 23% and 31%, respectively.

        "content": "Fed Chair Powell Signals Patience In Rate Policy, Labels Producer Inflation Data As 'Mixed'\n\nDuring a discussion with Dutch Central Bank President Klaas Knot in Amsterdam, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reinforced his stance that U.S. monetary policy will likely maintain its current rate for a more extended period than previously anticipated, aiming to further reduce inflation towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\nLikewise, Powell dismissed the risks of new rate hikes, echoing his remarks from the May Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference.\n\nResponding to an audience question about the likelihood of future rate hikes, Powell suggested, based on current data, \u201cthe next move that we make would be more likely to hold the policy rate where it is,\u201d rather than increasing it.\n\nLabor Market Is Still Very Strong\n\nPowell praised the recent performance of the U.S. economy, noting, \u201cThe U.S. economy has been performing very well lately.\u201d He attributed this strength to a robust labor market characterized by rising employment and wages, leading to increased consumer spending.\n\n\u201cHouseholds are in good shape financially,\u201d he observed, emphasizing they are not overly leveraged, which supports continued economic health.\n\nThe Fed Chair also highlighted the significant role of immigration in bolstering the economy over the past few years, adding to the overall positive outlook. Business investment has been another area of strength, with companies capitalizing on opportunities to expand.\n\nReflecting on the labor market, Powell described it as \u201cvery, very strong,\u201d noting that it had cooled from its overheated state a few years ago to a more balanced condition. \u201cThe labor market is about as tight as it was before the pandemic in 2019,\u201d he stated, highlighting that real wages are now positive and unemployment has remained below 4% for 27 consecutive months \u2014 a rare occurrence over the past half-century.\n\nInflation Still Requires Caution, PPI \u201cMixed\u201d\n\nDespite the strong labor market, Powell acknowledged the path to lowering inflation was not smooth.\n\n\u201cWe had higher readings in the first quarter and higher than we expected,\u201d he admitted. This situation underscored the need for patience, allowing the restrictive monetary policy to take effect gradually.\n\nPowell remarked on the significant progress made in combating inflation: \u201cWe\u2019ve made real progress on inflation. We\u2019re far lower than we were.\u201d He initially feared reducing the high inflation rates could lead to a significant decline in employment and economic weakening, which, fortunately, did not occur.\n\nDespite these improvements, Powell recognized the public\u2019s discontent, primarily because \u201cprices are high\u201d when shopping, which impacts the overall sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe described the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) as \u201cmixed,\u201d with higher headline numbers but also some backward revisions that require careful analysis.\n\nPowell noted businesses still report labor shortages, which are now being addressed, but may take time to reflect in broader economic indicators and inflation metrics. He expressed confidence that inflation would eventually stabilize at the 2% target, emphasizing, \u201cI am confident that we will get inflation down to 2%.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think by many, many measures the policy rate is restrictive. The question is it sufficiently restrictive and I think that\u2019s going to be a question that time will have to tell,\u201d he stated.\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, experienced volatile trading during Powell\u2019s press remarks. Initially, the broader stock market fell due to expectations that interest rates would remain higher for an extended period. However, it later rebounded after Powell dismissed the possibility of new interest rate hikes.\n\nThe Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), which follows the U.S. Dollar Index, did not manage to rebound from its decline following the mixed Producer Price Index (PPI) report. Treasury yields softened throughout the day, with the 10-year yield decreasing to 4.47%.\n\nThe SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), which tracks the price of gold, maintained its gains for the session, with an ounce of the precious metal changing hands at $2,350 per ounce, marking a 0.7% increase for the day.\n\nRead Now:US Consumers Brace For Higher Inflation, Home Price Surge: New York Fed Survey\n\nThis image was created by artificial intelligence MidJourney\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Fed Chair Powell Signals Patience In Rate Policy, Labels Producer Inflation Data As 'Mixed' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Warren Buffett Believes In S&P 500 Index Funds - But Are They Really Worth It?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWarren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.\n\nThough Buffett\u2019s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha only has 41 stocks in his portfolio, out of which two are S&P 500 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He holds nearly 40,000 shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), valued at approximately $18.73 million. He has also maintained a stake in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), holding 43,000 shares valued at $18.78 million.\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett had once said. \"The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,\" he further added.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here's how you can collect passive rental income without being a landlord. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.\n\nWhy Does Buffett Like Index ETFs So Much?\n\nBuffett\u2019s rationale behind endorsing S&P 500 index funds is rooted in their simplicity and effectiveness. He argues that attempting to outperform the market is futile for most investors, and instead, they should seek exposure to the broad U.S. stock market through low-cost index funds.\n\n\"The record shows that the unmanaged index fund is going to do quite well over time and active investment as a group can't beat it,\" Buffett once said.\n\nDespite the macroeconomic headwinds, Buffett believes the U.S. economy will bounce back over the long run.\n\n\"The temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something. Just keep buying,\" Buffett said during the 2017 annual shareholders meeting. \"American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett\u2019s investment philosophy, characterized by simplicity and discipline, has yielded remarkable results over the years. Despite his exceptional ability to select winning stocks, he emphasizes the value of a diversified investment portfolio, warning against unnecessary risks. His recommendation to consistently invest in low-cost index funds, especially during market volatility, resonates with investors of all levels of experience.\n\nAre Index ETFs Worth It?\n\nETFs like S&P 500 index funds have gained popularity among investors due to their cost-effectiveness and liquidity. They offer diversification at a fraction of the cost of actively managed funds, making them an attractive option for those seeking steady wealth accumulation.\n\nDespite the allure, Buffett highlighted the importance of keeping the total cost of investment low so as not to eat away at gains. The expense ratio, which denotes the cost of managing the fund, is a crucial factor.\n\nFor instance,\u00a0 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust comes with an expense ratio of 0.095%, while Vanguard S&P 500 ETF charges 0.03%. Over the long term, these seemingly small fees can significantly impact investors\u2019 overall returns.\n\n\"Costs really matter in investments,\" Buffett said, \"If returns are going to be seven or eight percent and you're paying one percent for fees, that makes an enormous difference in how much money you're going to have in retirement.\"\n\nBeyond Stocks and Bonds: Preparing for Uncertain Times\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about a market downturn in the near future, with many experts warning that the stock market is in for a rough ride. Warren Buffett has even begun taking defensive measures by increasing Berkshire Hathaway's cash position as the economy becomes more unpredictable.\n\nPhysical assets, such as real estate, are well-regarded as a strong hedge against recession. Real estate has the ability to provide consistent cash flow, ensuring your portfolio continues to produce returns. One of the most stable types of real estate is single-family rentals. No matter what's happening in the market, people need a place to live and will always prioritize paying rent.\n\nArrived, an investment platform backed by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, allows individual investors to own shares of rental properties that pay out monthly cash dividends. Investors can become fractional owners in properties they choose while Arrived handles the management responsibilities.\n\nThe platform has already funded more than 370 homes and paid out nearly $6 million in dividends to investors. It takes about 10 minutes to get set up, and the minimum investment is only $100, meaning you could own a cash-flowing rental property today.\n\nClick here to browse properties currently available.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here\u2019s how to invest in the city\u2019s growth before he floods it with new tech workers. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nWarren Buffett | Photo by Fortune Live Media on Flickr\n\nThis article Warren Buffett Believes In S&P 500 Index Funds - But Are They Really Worth It? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

(CORRECTED)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to correct an error in the price action of Charter Communications stock.\n\nA worse-than-expected University of Michigan May consumer report halted stock gains on Friday, sparking worries about a potential decline in consumer health amid perceived rising price pressures.\n\nThe report disclosed that both near-term and long-term inflation expectations have surged beyond projections this month, causing the broader consumer gauge to hit its lowest levels in six months.\n\n\u201cIf spending slows down and inflation increases, we'll get the opposite of the Goldilocks scenario that many were hoping for, and the Fed will be in an especially difficult position of choosing between accommodating a slowing economy and fighting increasing inflation expectations,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\nEchoing this view, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, sees rising risks of stagflation, a concern that could unsettle markets.\n\nAt 12:05 p.m. trading in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.1% lower, but it was firmly up by 1.6% for the week, poised to secure a third consecutive week of gains after three of losses.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was a tad higher, battling to secure the eight straight session of gains, the longest positive streak since December 2023. Tech stocks were flat. Small caps were the underperformers, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) down 0.9%.\n\nThe rising inflation perceptions in the consumer survey rescued the dollar, which eyes a positive weekly close, after two negative ones.\n\nTreasury yields also inched higher by about 4 basis points across all maturities. The 10-year benchmark hit 4.5%.\n\nGold surged to $2,385/oz, with the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) up 0.8%.\n\nThe dismal consumer sentiment data sharply weighed on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) with the largest cryptocurrency dropping over 4% from $63,000 to below $60,500 following the report.\n\nChart of The Day: Michigan Consumer Sentiment Data Dings Bitcoin\n\nFriday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Dow Jones 39,411.32 0.1 % Nasdaq 100 18,108.22 0.0% S&P 500 5,209.09 -0.1 % Russell 2000 204.04 -0.9%\n\nUpdated at 1:05 p.m.\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was unchanged at $520.20, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.2% to $394.65 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was up 0.1% to $441.38, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the Financials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) outperformed, up 0.5%.

The pharmaceutical company reported a lower than expected loss last quarter, but missed revenue estimates. MacroGenics Inc. (NASDAQ:MGNX) tumbled by 77% following an interim update on a mid-stage study of a cancer drug candidate, which reported the unfortunate deaths of several study participants. Furthermore, the results for the quarter fell short of expectations. Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) rose 4.6% after the company started a tender offer to buy back senior secured notes due 2025 for up to $1.7 billion in cash. Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) dropped by 4% after the company announced that the FDA won\u2019t finish its review of MRNA\u2019s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine by the scheduled action date of May 12 due to administrative constraints.

        "content": "Consumer Sentiment Falls In May, Inflation Expectations Strongly Exceed Fed's 2% Goal: 'They Now Perceive Negative Developments'\n\nThe latest University of Michigan report shows a troubling drop in U.S. consumer confidence, signaling potential weakness in household finances alongside a worrying increase in consumer inflation expectations.\n\n\u201cConsumer sentiment retreated about 13% this May following three consecutive months of very little change. This 10 index-point decline is statistically significant and brings sentiment to its lowest reading in about six months,\u201d Surveys of Consumers Director\u00a0Joanne Hsu, said.\n\nUMich Consumer Sentiment Report For May: Key Highlights\n\nThe University of Michigan consumer sentiment index eased from 77.9 in April to 66.5 in May, missing expectations of 76, according to preliminary data. It marks the lowest level in consumer sentiment since November 2023. The sub-index for consumer expectations tumbled from 76 to 66.5, well below the expected 75. The sub-index for current conditions fell from 79 to 68.8, hitting a 6-month low, missing the predicted 79. The year-ahead inflation expectations rose further from 3.2% to 3.5%, topping the 3.2% expected. Long-term inflation expectations rose from 3.1%.\n\nEconomist Takeaways\n\nAccording to Hsu, \u201cConsumers in western states exhibited a particularly steep drop. While consumers had been reserving judgment for the past few months, they now perceive negative developments on a number of dimensions.\u201d\n\nShe emphasized that consumers are expressing concerns about the possibility of inflation, unemployment, and interest rates all trending unfavorably in the upcoming year.\n\n\u201cYear-ahead inflation expectations rose from 3.2% last month to 3.5% this month, remaining above the 2.3-3.0% range seen in the two years prior to the pandemic. Long-run inflation expectations remain elevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic,\u201d she added.\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nStocks slightly trimmed daily gains following the release of the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment report.\n\nThe S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), was 0.3% higher at 10:08 a.m. in New York, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, as monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), rose 0.5%.\n\nThe dollar saw a marginal uptick, aided by the hotter-than-forecasted consumer expectations data. Treasury yields were slightly higher on Friday, sending bond-related ETFs, such as the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT), lower.\n\nRead now: US Ready To Impose New Tariffs On China\u2019s EV, Solar Sectors: \u2018Could Cause More Severe Damage\u2019 Than Last Trade War\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Consumer Sentiment Falls In May, Inflation Expectations Strongly Exceed Fed's 2% Goal: 'They Now Perceive Negative Developments' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Investors Flock To Lower-Cost Vanguard S&P 500 ETF: Is It Time To Switch From SPY To VOO?\n\nA seismic shift is currently underway among the world\u2019s largest exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which could redefine the landscape of the ETF universe.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the largest ETF globally with over $500 billion in assets under management, experienced significant outflows since the beginning of the year.\n\nIn contrast, its lower-cost peers, especially the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), saw an influx of investments.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving this trend?\n\nOutflows From SPY ETF On The Rise\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust witnessed outflows totaling $28 billion since the year\u2019s start, according to data from Vettafi.\n\nThis shift is notable because it occurs against a backdrop where the U.S. stock market has been on the rise, indicating that the performance of the underlying investments isn\u2019t the cause of the outflows.\n\nThe primary driver behind this shift appeared to be the cost associated with managing these funds, rather than their performance.\n\nSPY has an expense ratio of 0.09%, significantly higher than some of its direct competitors. Even a few basis points can make a considerable difference in investor returns over time, especially for institutional or very large individual investors.\n\nChart: SPY ETF Witnesses $28 Billion In Outflows Year-To-Date\n\nInflows In Lower-Cost Peers\n\nWhile SPY has been seeing outflows, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF welcomed inflows of $33 billion during the same period. Another competitor, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV), attracted $14.53 billion.\n\nThese ETFs track the same index as SPY and have nearly identical portfolios.\n\nThe distinguishing factor is their expense ratios: the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF charge just 0.03%, compared to SPY's 0.09%.\n\nChart: VOO ETF Sees Over $33 Billion In Inflows Year-To-Date\n\nRead Also: 5 Things You Need To Know About Vanguard ETFs: Why There\u2019s No Bitcoin ETF In Their Lineup?\n\nShould You Switch From SPY to VOO?\n\nAlthough a difference of 0.06% in expense ratios might seem negligible, it becomes significant with larger investments or over extended periods.\n\nFor instance, on a $10,000 investment, choosing VOO over SPY saves an investor $6 annually. However, for a $10 million investment, the annual savings jump to $6,000.\n\nTo illustrate the long-term impact, consider an investor who starts with a $100,000 investment in an S&P 500 fund. Assuming an average annual return of 7%, after 20 years, this investment would grow to $384,803 with VOO, compared to $380,509 with SPY, due to the difference in expense ratios.\n\nOver time, these seemingly small differences can result in substantial divergences in end wealth, due to the effect of compounding returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, for individual investors, particularly those with substantial amounts or long investment horizons, the cost savings from ETFs associated with lower expense ratios should not be overlooked.\n\nIf a person was considering a switch from SPY to VOO, it\u2019s essential to weigh these factors along with any potential tax implications or transaction costs associated with such a move.\n\nFor many, the long-term savings on fees could justify the switch, enhancing overall returns while keeping the same portfolio structure.\n\nYet, if a person had significant holdings in the SPY, they need to consider the tax costs associated with selling their shares. To avoid these potential tax liabilities, maintain the investment in SPY and start diverting new funds into a more cost-effective ETF, such as the VOO or the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV).\n\nTable Comparison: SPY vs. VOO vs. IVV\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) Issuer State Street Global Advisor Vanguard iShares \u2013 BlackRock Inc.

        "content": "Unemployment Claims Surge More Than Expected, Hit 8-Month Peak: Dollar Falls As Traders Bet On Rate Cuts\n\nThe number of individuals filing for unemployment benefits soared more than predicted last week, suggesting emerging weaknesses in the labor market.\n\nJobless claims rose from 209,000 to 231,000 for the week that ended on May 4, marking the highest level since August of the previous year, according to data released by the Department of Labor. This rise ended a sequence of four weeks when the figures were consistently below expectations, and it was higher than the anticipated 210,000 print.\n\nThe four-week moving average of initial claims, which reduces the volatility of weekly data, increased by 4,750, reaching 215,000. On an unadjusted basis, the claims went up by 19,690 to 209,324, with notable increases in several states: New York saw an increase of 10,248, California 4,198, Indiana 2,439, and Illinois 2,003.\n\nThese figures strengthen the perception that the U.S. labor market\u2019s momentum is diminishing, as highlighted by the recent employment report, which indicated a slower-than-expected growth in nonfarm employment and a surprising increase in the unemployment rate.\n\nRead also:Jobs Growth Slows, Unemployment Ticks Up, Wage Increase Cools: \u2018The Market Should Love This Report\u2019\n\nMarket reactions\n\nFollowing the release of the unemployment claims data, the U.S. Dollar saw a significant drop.

However, small-cap stocks were the laggards of the day, with the Russell 2000 Index declining by 0.9%.\n\nIn the commodities market, the Energy Information Administration\u2019s report of a decline in crude oil inventories last week led to a modest 0.6% increase in West Texas Intermediate prices.

Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women\u2019s health problem at 80 cents per share.\n\nAfter successfully calling for the 2022 market selloff during market euphoria in September 2021, Wilson announced he would no longer make index-level calls, attributing his mistakes as being in \"a humbling business\" and that he now spends more time looking at specific companies.\n\nPopular financial X user Barchart mocked Wilson's failed market forecasts, recently posting \"after being wrong about everything over the last 18 months, Wilson has decided to no longer make bold predictions about the S&P 500.\"\n\nWhile he retains his CIO position, Morgan Stanley said in an internal memo in February that Wilson would be leaving the firm's Global Investment Committee.Chief Operating Officer Jed Finn said Wilson would \"focus on serving his key institutional clients, where the demand for generating tactical alpha is intensifying.\"\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Wealth Management division has recently brought negative attention to the firm. It is the target of a multiagency probe that includes the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other Treasury Department offices.\n\nThe investigation stems from concerns that Morgan Stantley's know your client (KYC) procedures may be inadequate. Wilson was hired as CIO of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division in 2012.\n\nWhile some investors and traders can be keen to follow Wall Street's short-term predictions, it may be worth remembering the famous quote by Fisher Investments Chairman Kenneth Fisher, who said, \"Time in the market beats timing the market.\"\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index, is up about 72% over the past five years and over 1,000% since 1993.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for investors in the upcoming series.

        "content": "US Stocks Eye Fourth Positive Session Despite Hawkish Fed Remarks; Disney, Palantir Tumble; Treasury Yields Fall: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?\n\nWall Street experienced a quiet session during morning trading on Tuesday, influenced by a lack of significant economic data and minimal updates on earnings from major large-cap companies.\n\nTraders largely disregarded the latest hawkish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who noted progress on inflation seen in the latter half of 2023 had stalled and mentioned the Federal Reserve might raise rates if inflation becomes persistent.\n\nKashkari also revealed he initially predicted two rate cuts for the year, but now anticipated possibly maintaining two, or reducing to one or none by the June Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nThe S&P 500 saw a modest increase of 0.2% around midday in New York, with similar gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the Dow Jones, all of which are poised for their fourth consecutive session of gains. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), representing small caps, performed notably well, rising 0.8%.\n\nTreasury yields declined slightly by about 6 basis points across various maturities from 5 to 30 years, with the 10-year benchmark decreasing to 4.4%, marking a fifth consecutive day of declines. This led to a continued rally in bonds, exemplified by a 1.1% increase in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT).\n\nIn corporate news, chipmaker Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) saw its shares drop over 13% following weaker-than-expected guidance.

        "content": "Sell In May And Go Away: Does The Trading Strategy Hold Up In Election Years?\n\nAs we enter May, the old Wall Street adage \u201csell in May and go away\u201d is finding its way back into the conversations of traders and investors.\n\nThe strategy suggests the stock market tends to underperform from May through October compared to the November through April period.\n\nA deeper dive into historical data and market trends suggests the trade may not always be the wisest course of action.\n\nSell In May And Go Away: Historical Performance\n\nThe sell in May and go away strategy is rooted in historical stock market patterns.\n\nGeorge Smith, a portfolio strategist at LPL Financials, highlights that since 1950, the May-October period has been the weakest six-month cycle in the stock market. In contrast, the November-April period sees far stronger stock returns.\n\n\u201cUnless investors can seek superior returns in other asset classes, being out of the equity market may not have been the best strategy,\u201d Smith says.\n\nThe expert remarks that average returns for the S&P 500 index during the May-October months have remained positive, recording 1.8% gains since 1950 and approximately 4.4% over the last five and 10 years.\n\nThe\u00a0S&P 500 Index\u00a0has recorded a cumulative six-month average gain of 6.7% in the period between November to April, the Corporate Finance Institute (CFI) finds.\n\nAndrew Loo, vice president of Capital Markets at CFI, highlights that the May to October interval generally sees subdued market optimism. This downturn follows the conclusion of first-quarter results and coincides with a seasonal decline in market attention as individuals take summer vacations.\n\nAdditionally, Loo says that during election years, the stock market often experiences a slump in September and October, primarily due to the uncertainties surrounding election outcomes.\n\nSell In May And Go Away In Elections Years: Myth Debunked\n\nContrary to popular belief, presidential election years do not necessarily equate to increased market volatility.\n\nRocky White, senior quantitative analyst at Schaeffer\u2019s Research, says the six-month returns leading to November presidential election have been rather positive.\n\nDuring presidential election years, the average return for the S&P 500 index is notably higher at 4.67%, compared to only 0.95% in midterm election years and 2.14% in non-election years.\n\nPresidential election years have the highest rate of positive returns at 89%, significantly higher than the 63% seen in both midterm and non-election years.\n\nThis suggests that the May-October window in a presidential election year tends to be more favorable for the stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\nS&P 500 Returns From Early May To Early November\n\nCategory Presidential Election* Mid-Term Election Non-Election Years No. of Returns 19 19 38 Average Return 4.67% 0.95% 2.14% Median Return 4.29% 2.38% 2.22% Percent Positive 89% 63% 63% Avg.

Deviation 9.77% 9.92% 7.92%\n\nData source: Schaeffer\u2019s Research\n\n6-Month S&P 500 Returns Are Even Better With Incumbent President In The Race\n\nWhite also notes that during presidential election years with an incumbent candidate, the S&P 500 has performed exceptionally well in the six months leading up to the ballots.\n\nSince 1948, the index has averaged returns of 7.57%, with 91% of returns being positive. In stark contrast, years without an incumbent have barely broken even, with the 2008 financial crisis heavily skewing the averages.\n\nS&P 500 Returns In 6 Months Leading Up To US Presidential Election\n\nCategory Incumbent Running No Incumbent No. of Returns 11 8 Average Return 7.57% 0.69% Median Return 6.43% 3.58% Percent Positive 91% 88% Avg. Positive 8.42% 4.76% Avg. Negative -0.87% -27.78% Std. Deviation 7.05% 11.95%\n\nSource: Schaeffer\u2019s Research\n\nIn the last U.S. presidential election, the S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), rallied by over 20% in the six months leading up to the Nov. 3, 2020 vote. In that case, the incumbent running was Donald Trump.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take: Several studies suggests the decision to \u201csell in May and go away\u201d may be overly simplistic and potentially disadvantageous for investors.\n\nWith historical data showing positive average returns even during the traditionally weaker months, and election years not necessarily exacerbating market volatility, a blanket strategy of exiting the stock market right away may not be prudent.\n\nRead now: Federal Reserve Takes Cautious Stand On Inflation, Powell Signals Preference For Rate Cuts Over Hikes\n\nIllustration created using Shutterstock photos and artificial intelligence via MidJourney.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Sell In May And Go Away: Does The Trading Strategy Hold Up In Election Years? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Buffett Believes The Greatest Investment Moves Are Met With Yawns - How Index Funds Really Can Build Wealth\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWarren Buffett, arguably one of the most successful investors of the 21st century, has amassed a wealth of $131 billion, making him the seventh richest person on this planet as of April 30.\n\nBuffett\u2019s Sage Advice: Don\u2019t Take Unnecessary Risk\n\nDuring the annual shareholders meeting in 2017, Buffett reiterated his long-standing belief in the simplicity of investing, stating, \u201cIf they told everybody what a simple game [investing] was, 90% of the income of the people that were speaking would disappear.\u201d Despite his vast success in owning businesses, Buffett has consistently emphasized the value of a diversified investment portfolio, advising against unnecessary risks.\n\nBuffett\u2019s philosophy underscores the significance of consistently investing in low-cost index funds, especially during market volatility. His recommendation to \u201cconsistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund\u201d has resonated with both seasoned investors and beginners alike.\n\n\u201cKeep buying it through thick and thin and especially through thin,\u201d Buffett emphasized in 2017, highlighting the importance of discipline and perseverance in wealth accumulation. \u201cI think it\u2019s the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time,\u201d Buffett added.\n\nETFs: The Simple Passive Investment Tool\n\nInvesting in S&P 500 index funds like SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is one of the easiest and most effective strategies. It allows investors to benefit from the soaring stock market while remaining shielded from the unnecessary risk that mid- and small-cap companies are typically exposed to.\n\n\u201cThe trick is not to pick the right company, the trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,\u201d Buffett stated.\n\nExchange-traded funds have become popular among investors, largely due to their cost-effectiveness. ETFs typically have lower expense ratios, making them an attractive option for cost-conscious investors. These funds are designed to track the performance of a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, offering diversification at a fraction of the cost of actively managed funds.\n\nThe appeal of ETFs is further enhanced by their liquidity, as they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices, providing investors with flexibility and accessibility. Buffett\u2019s endorsement of index funds as the holy grail in this era of uncertainty reflects his belief in their long-term potential to generate wealth steadily.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cCosts really matter in investments,\u201d Buffett added. \u201cIf returns are going to be seven or eight percent and you\u2019re paying one percent for fees, that makes an enormous difference in how much money you\u2019re going to have in retirement.\u201d\n\nAmidst fluctuating market conditions and economic uncertainties, Buffett\u2019s advice serves as a beacon of stability for investors seeking to navigate the complexities of the financial landscape.\n\n\u201cThe temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something. Just keep buying,\u201d Buffett said further during the 2017 annual shareholders meeting. \u201cAmerican business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.\u201d\n\nA New Approach To The Index Fund Model\n\nCityfunds offers a unique twist on the traditional index fund model by focusing on real estate investments in specific markets. Each Cityfund is a diversified portfolio of Home Equity Investments (HEIs) in a particular city, allowing investors to gain exposure to that market\u2019s growth potential.\n\nAs the value of the properties within a Cityfund appreciates, so should the value of the fund\u2019s shares. This innovative approach unlocks the $32.6 trillion home equity market, which has grown by an impressive 211% since 2013, making it accessible to individual investors for the first time. By investing in Cityfunds, individuals can benefit from the potential upside of the real estate market while enjoying the diversification and risk-adjusted returns that come with investing in a portfolio of carefully vetted properties.\n\nSome of the markets available to invest in through Cityfunds are Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas, Austin, Phoenix and more high-growth cities. Click here to explore Cityfunds\u2019s offerings.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here\u2019s how to invest in the city\u2019s growth before he floods it with new tech workers. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nWarren Buffett | Photo courtesy: Flickr\n\nThis article Buffett Believes The Greatest Investment Moves Are Met With Yawns - How Index Funds Really Can Build Wealth originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "April Showers On Wall Street: Miners, Utilities Emerge As Bright Spots In Gloomy Market\n\nAs April comes to a close, it\u2019s time to compile the rankings for the top-performing sector and industry exchange-traded funds of the month.\n\nTaking a broader look at the stock market, the S&P 500 Index, represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), finished April on a downturn, declining by approximately 3%. This marks the end of a five-month streak of gains.\n\nSimilarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), experienced a 3.5% decline.\n\nAmong large-cap indices, blue-chip stocks showed slight underperformance, with the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) slipping by 4.5%.\n\nSmall-cap stocks, represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), plummeted by over 6%, marking their worst performance since October 2023.\n\nOverall, it has been a challenging month for the stock market, primarily due to inflation surprises surpassing expectations. This has led to a recalibration of market expectations regarding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\nAdditionally, complex global geopolitical tensions have emerged, notably between Israel and Iran, alongside the ongoing issue in the Gaza Strip.\n\nMay is anticipated to start with a crucial event as investors await the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday.\n\nWhile no interest rate changes are expected, all eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2018s remarks to assess the Fed\u2019s stance in response to recent inflation surprises.\n\nRead also: Federal Reserve Meeting Preview: High Interest Rates \u2018Need More Time To Work,\u2019 Bank of America Says\n\nPerformance Of Sector ETFs In April 2024\n\nAt the sector level, only the utilities sector managed to avoid losses for the month, rising by 2.1%.\n\nThe largest stock contributors to the utilities\u2019 performance in April are NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Southern Company (NYSE:SO), Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) and NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) which showed monthly gains between 4% and 8%.\n\nEnergy stocks remained broadly stable, while the other nine S&P 500\u2019s sectors showcased losses.\n\nReal estate experienced the worst performance, down by over 7%, dragged down by its high sensitivity to interest rates, as Treasury yields increase across the board during the month.\n\nFollowing real estate, the technology and healthcare sectors also showed poor performance in April.\n\nApril\u2019s Best And Worst Sector ETFs: Utilities Lead, Real Estate Lags\n\nSector April 2024 performance Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) 2.06% Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) 0.01% Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP) -1.11% Industrials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLI) -3.23% Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) -3.68% Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) -3.85% Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB) -4.13% Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) -4.24% Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) -4.78% Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV) -4.85% Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) -7.83%\n\nData as of Apr. 30, 2024 2:50 p.m. EDT\n\nStory continues\n\nPerformance Of Industry ETFs In April 2024\n\nBased on the industry ETF list provided by BlackRock Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) iShares, only five out of the 25 industries managed to report gains in April.

Additionally, core PCE inflation, which excludes energy and food items, surpassed predictions (2.8% vs. 2.6%).\n\nThe policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields closed the month above the 5% mark, reaching the highest levels since Nov. 13, 2023.\n\nRead Now: Is Hawkish Shift On Inflation Imminent?

        "content": "S&P 500 Trades At Two-Month Low: Where Is The Next Support?\n\nThe S&P 500\u2019s descent below the 5,000 mark marks a two-month low, bringing the index\u2019s worst monthly performance since December 2022 into sharp focus.\n\nAfter closing in the red for the last six sessions, the index \u2014 tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) \u2014 is currently facing its worst losing streak since September 2022.\n\nFurthermore, prices have slipped below the 50-day moving average, a bearish signal that may foretell further downturns.\n\nAs the market closed last Friday, the S&P 500\u2019s drawdown was recorded at -5.5% from its most recent peak, though it remains up year-to-date and above its 2021 high.\n\nWhere does the current support lie? How much lower could the S&P 500 potentially fall?\n\nS&P 500 Technical Analysis: Experts Eye 4,800 Levels\n\n\u201cTaking it into historical context, it's only registering as noise at the moment,\u201d observedCallum Thomas, head of research and founder at Topdown Charts.\n\nGiven the past bearish breadth divergence, the recent fall below the 50-day moving average, and the breach of the 5,000-point support level, there\u2019s a considerable chance the index could retest the 4,800 level, according to Thomas.\n\nAlso renewed veteran investor Ed Yardeni expected that a pullback up to 4,800 could be on the table at this juncture.\n\n\u201cIt might reach around 4800, which would match the peak just before the previous bear market and put the index unchanged for the year so far,\u201d he said in a recent note.\n\nFurther declines could see it approach the 200-day moving average, around 4,700, which would equate to a 10.6% correction from its all-time high, Yardeni added.\n\nThis week could extend the sell-off trend, but an unexpected drop in the March Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation rate this Friday might pivot the market towards a robust rally.\n\nS&P 500 Drawdowns Are Healthy, History Tells\n\nHistorically, market downturns are not uncommon, and for long-term investors, they present no grave threat.\n\nFred Alger Management, LLC, recently highlighted that \u201csince 1990, the average drawdown in the S&P 500 has been 14% per calendar year, with drawdowns of at least 10% occurring in 19 of the past 34 years.\u201d\n\nOver the past half-century measured in trading days, the S&P 500 has spent nearly half (44%) of the time in correction territory, having fallen 10% or more from its previous high.\n\nDespite these drawdowns, the index has still returned over 11% annually during this period, turning a hypothetical $10,000 investment into over $2 million. This supports the adage that \u201cit's time in the market, not timing the market,\u201d that counts.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow Read:US Stocks Set To Open Fresh Week Higher On Big Tech Earnings Hopes: Analyst Warns Any Letdown Could Push Market \u2018Deeper Into Oversold Territory\u2019\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article S&P 500 Trades At Two-Month Low: Where Is The Next Support? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

This decline followed Deutsche Bank\u2019s downgrade of the EV-maker from Buy to Hold, citing concerns over the strategic pivot to autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn the data front, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index posted a sharp upside surprise, registering at 15.5 compared to the expected 1.5 for April. However, existing home sales disappointed expectations, declining 4.3% year over year.\n\nCommodities experienced a rebound, with copper witnessing strong gains, up over 2% to reach a 22-month high, and gold showing further strength with a 1% increase.

        "content": "96% Of S&P 500 Stocks Show Upside Potential Vs. Street Estimates: Which Offers The Best Opportunity?\n\nNinety-six percent, or 480 out of the 500 companies comprising the S&P 500 index, are trading at lower market values compared to Wall Street analysts\u2019 price targets, signaling abundant potential profit opportunities for investors.\n\nThus far, April has marked the bleakest month for the U.S. stock market since September 2023, with the S&P 500 index, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), falling by 3.7%.\n\nAcross all 11 sectors constituting the index, only the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) has managed to evade losses. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) emerged as the month\u2019s weakest performer, experiencing a 10% downturn.\n\nHigher-than-expected inflation figures have placed downward pressure on stocks, leading to reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. As of April 18, investors expect fewer than two rate cuts, down from over three anticipated at the beginning of the month.\n\nSimultaneously, mounting geopolitical risks stemming from the ongoing Middle East crisis have amplified market uncertainties.\n\nHowever, this phase of increased volatility has subdued the once prevalent bullish sentiment that persisted until the end of March, uncovering attractive opportunities for investors who favor buying the dips of undervalued stocks.\n\nPresented herein are the top 5 contrarian stocks within the S&P 500 index exhibiting the most pronounced relative gap between current market prices and median price targets.\n\n5. Carnival Corporation\n\nCarnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) has experienced a noticeable downturn, dropping by 11.54% this month and 22.03% year-to-date.\n\nAnalysts, however, have maintained consistency in their price forecasts. At the beginning of the year, the median target was $20.78, which has since held steady at $22.\n\nThis suggests a substantial 52.20% potential upside from the current trading price of $14.46 per share.\n\n4. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.\n\nBio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best low cost ETFs. If you want to see the top 5 low cost ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Low Cost ETFs.\n\nBeginner investors usually go for passive investing, with a focus on consistently increasing wealth over the long term with lower fees and reduced risk. In contrast, investors with more experience may have an inclination towards active investing, seeking to profit from short-term shifts in the market. Passive investment plans normally involve investing in a range of stocks, bonds, and other assets to achieve easy diversification. This approach helps in lessening the impact of market volatility as the investment is spread across different assets. Passive funds, like low-cost ETFs or passively managed mutual funds, offer affordable investment choices with lower management fees and less trading activity. It is also relatively easier to maintain them as they do not require as much ongoing research as active funds do. On the other hand, active investing allows portfolio managers to select investments based on their own judgment rather than following a specific index or predetermined portfolio. This flexibility allows them to respond to real-time market conditions and potentially surpass short-term market benchmarks. Active investing often involves active trading strategies like short-selling and hedging to maximize short-term price movements. However, active fund managers generally charge higher fees due to the higher frequency of trading and specific expertise required for this strategy.\n\nIn 2023, global passive equity funds became more popular than active funds for the first time. This shift was driven by investors seeking lower-cost options that follow broad market indices. Passive equity funds reached $15.1 trillion in net assets by December, surpassing the $14.3 trillion held by active funds. This trend towards passive funds began after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought safer investments during uncertain times, as reported by Reuters. In 2023, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) attracted the most inflows, bringing in $52.83 billion. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and Fidelity 500 Index (NASDAQ:FXAIX) followed closely, attracting $38.1 billion and $24.79 billion, respectively. Geoffrey Strotman, senior vice president at Segal Marco Advisors, believes that the increasing popularity of passive funds could lead to pricing discrepancies. This could create opportunities for active managers to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS AG, predicts a comeback for active funds in 2024. He expects Federal Reserve rate cuts to lower borrowing costs, benefiting small-cap companies more than larger ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) suggests that investors consider using actively managed strategies more often. They believe that with higher interest rates, ongoing inflation, and increased geopolitical risks, active managers and hedge funds have better chances to outperform simple buy-and-hold portfolios. In the decade leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, stocks and bonds in developed markets exceeded cash by about 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to BlackRock analysts. Despite this, many investors have been moving away from actively managed funds, with over half of mutual fund and ETF assets in passive products since late last year. At the end of last year, BlackRock managed about $10 trillion in client assets, with $2.6 trillion in active equity, bond, and other strategies, and $6.6 trillion in index and ETF assets. The analysts at BlackRock point out that switching between indexes is a type of active management, enabling investors \u201cto exploit their skill in timing markets and their ability to consistently pick exposure to the right sectors, regions and styles.\u201d\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best low cost ETFs, which offer investors exposure to stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc.

We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of April 15, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. It is important to note, however, that not all ETFs have been trading for 5 years.

It focuses on investing in companies with a combination of high trailing and future free cash flow yields, which also have a track record of increasing dividends.

Back in September 2022, FedEx was selling for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings due to substantial pessimism.

FedEx\u2019s DRIVE program, which seeks to deliver $4 billion in permanent cost reductions by creating an integrated air-ground network similar to that of rival UPS, is showing progress, and workforce reductions have also been enacted. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx\u2019s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry\u2019s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.\u201d\n\n14. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 31.15%\n\nNext on our list of the best low cost ETFs is the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR), which aims to reflect the performance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, which includes small-cap US stocks.

(NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGoing forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.\n\n10.

        "content": "Most S&P 500 Stocks No Longer Trade Above 50-Day Average: Healthy Pullback Or Is The Bull Market Over?\n\nFor the first time since early November 2023, less than 30% of S&P 500 stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average \u2014 a clear indicator of the current poor market\u2019s breadth.\n\nThis significant drop from the 85% observed in late March and 92% at the beginning of January highlights a dramatic reversal in market dynamics.\n\nThe 50-day moving average is often seen as a barometer for the short-term health of stocks. Falling below this level en masse suggests that a broad swath of the market is facing downward pressure.\n\nThis shift comes amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and renewed concerns over inflation, which have collectively nudged traders towards a more guarded stance in April.\n\nOn Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) closed 0.3% lower, marking its fourth straight session in the red. That\u2019s the longest losing streak since early January.\n\nChart: Less Than 30% of S&P 500 Stocks Trade Below 50-Day Moving Average\n\nInflation Concerns\n\nMarch saw inflation rates rise to 3.5%, overcoming economist expectations and continuing a three-month trend of increases.\n\n\u201cThe recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,\u201d Powell said Wednesday.\n\nThat sounded like an official delay to rate-cut hopes. With inflation proving stubborn, the outlook for interest rates has shifted significantly.\n\nFutures markets are now anticipating roughly 40 basis points in cuts by the end of the year, or less two quarter-percentage points Fed rate cuts.\n\nS&P 500 Outlook: Heading To A Correction?\n\nInvestment analysts are closely watching these market developments.\n\nVeteran investor Ed Yardeni recently predicted a potential retest of the S&P 500's 200-day moving average around the 4700 level, which would represent \u201ca classic 10% correction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe S&P 500 is experiencing its first real bout of volatility this year,\u201d said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nThe index has seen a 3.9% decline in April, which has begun to \u201ccreate some technical damage.\u201d Notably, the S&P 500 has breached its shorter-term uptrend and fallen below its \u201c20- and 50-day moving average (dma),\u201d positioning the 5,000-point mark as the next critical support level.\n\nTurnquist highlighted that longer-term breadth indicators are more robust, with \u201cnearly 70% of S&P 500 constituents remain above their 200-dma.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of major damage to longer-term breadth across the offensive sectors suggests bullish leadership is still on stable ground despite the recent shakeout,\u201d he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nStephen Suttmeier, technical strategist at Bank of America, highlighted that 12 consecutive months of positive year-over-year returns for the S&P 500 could portend well for the future.\n\nData suggests that if this trend continues for at least 20 months, the index could see a rise of up to 17.1% (6,150 points) by November 2025.\n\nHowever, Suttmeier warned of near-term risks. The S&P 500\u2019s struggle to surpass the mid-5,200s, amid typical election year volatility in April and May, points to possible near-term challenges.\n\nSupport levels at 5,000, 4,800, and 4,600 will be crucial if the index falters.\n\nThe lack of deeply oversold conditions, as indicated by the three-month VIX relative to historical levels and the percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving averages, suggests that the market might need further corrections to establish a more robust low.\n\nRead Now: Fund Managers Are The Most Optimistic Since 2022: \u2018Bull Sentiment Not Quite At Close-Your-Eyes-And-Sell Levels\u2019\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Most S&P 500 Stocks No Longer Trade Above 50-Day Average: Healthy Pullback Or Is The Bull Market Over? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "How Does The Stock Market Perform Ahead Of Tax Day? 'Rough' At First, Data Shows\n\nThere are tons of interesting tidbits about Tax Day.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS):\n\nOfficers answered more than one million taxpayer phone calls this season. They processed over 100 million individual tax returns through April 6. Tens of millions more filings will be made on the April 15 deadline. About 19 million taxpayers will file extensions due Oct. 15. More than $200 billion in refunds were already delivered. The average refund was $3,011 \u2014 a 4.6% increase from last April's average of $2,878.\n\nThese numbers change yearly, but there\u2019s at least one fairly consistent Tax-Day trend: a jittery stock market.\n\nAccording to Bankrate, citing data from S&P Global\u2019s Kensho unit, the first couple weeks of April are typically \u201crougher.\u201d\n\nMany taxpayers will liquidate stocks or tap their money market funds to fulfill immediate cash requirements.\n\nAnd from 2000 to 2016, the S&P 500 Index declined an average 0.2% during the first two weeks before Tax Day.\n\nAfter Tax Day, it\u2019s a different scenario. The S&P 500 usually bounces back to finish April about 1.7% higher on average (climbing \u201can astonishing\u201d 75% of the time, Bankrate notes).\n\nPer Money.com, the S&P 500 index enjoyed an average gain of 0.83% in the week following the tax deadline from 1998 to 2022 (for 19 out of 25 years). The one-week median gain throughout the year is 0.31%.\n\nIn April, the market\u2019s overall impact is minimal. Investors would be wise to stick to their long-term investment strategy and prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged retirement accounts (i.e., 401k plans and IRAs).\n\nHistorically, the S&P 500 has yielded around 10 percent annual gains. The goal is to stay invested over time rather than attempting to time the market.\n\nFinancial advisors typically suggest that their clients invest in S&P 500 index funds (see below) and remain focused on distant future outcomes rather than short-term fluctuations.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP)\n\nYardeni Research president Ed Yardeni predicts the S&P 500 could surge 26% by 2026 to 6,500.\n\n\"I think this is a long-term bull market,\u201d the economist told CNBC in March. \u201cI still got 5,400 by year-end and that was a pretty bold call a year ago, but right now that's looking pretty conservative, and why not more?\"\n\nNow Read: Retail Sales Rises More Than Expected In March, Indicate Strong Consumer Spending\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article How Does The Stock Market Perform Ahead Of Tax Day?

        "content": "It's been a terrible year so far for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.\n\nCommonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.\n\nJordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nUS military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here\u2019s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.

(NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.\n\nKlein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.\n\nDan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share.

Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought and held since its 1984 initial public offering (IPO) would be sitting on an over 142,000% gain.\n\nThe 13Fs are due within 45 days of a quarter ending, so investors waiting for the next updates on Berkshire\u2019s portfolio will likely need to wait until mid-May.\n\nRead More on Startup Investing:\n\nWealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.

We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi\u2019s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\n\n10.

Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company\u2019s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.\u201d\n\n9. Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VYM)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 11: 36.10%\n\nNext on our list of the best Vanguard ETFs is Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VYM).

Its portfolio comprises 450 stocks, and net assets totaling $63.3 billion as of January 31, 2024.\n\nVanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VYM)\u2019s top holding is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). On March 8, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) declared a $5.25 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous.

The company also announced earnings that were relatively in line with estimates with some benefit of better operating expenses. The stock appears to be one of the first real beneficiaries of generative artificial intelligence (AI) with meaningful revenue expected to show up in 2024.\u201d\n\n8. Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VTV)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 11: 45.76%\n\nVanguard Value Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VTV) aims to replicate the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index, tracking the investment return of large-capitalization value stocks. This ETF mirrors the performance of numerous prominent value stocks in the United States. Employing a passively managed, full-replication approach, Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VTV) has a net expense ratio of 0.04% as of February 28, 2024. With a portfolio comprising 350 stocks, the fund's net assets amount to $157.0 billion as of January 31, 2024.

(NYSE:BRK-B) is the largest holding of Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VTV). In Q4 2023, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) reported strong financial results with a nearly 21% increase in operating revenue, excluding investment and derivative gains/losses. The growth was driven by the insurance and reinsurance operations, along with investment income, benefiting from improved cash flow trends due to lower catastrophes and higher short-term interest rates. Analyst Cathy Seifert from CFRA, who assigned the stock a Buy rating on February 26, considers this growth significant for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\u2019s size.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 117 hedge funds were long Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 116 funds in the last quarter.\n\nHere is what Black Bear Value Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGoing forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.\u201d\n\n7. Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VHT)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 11: 53.46%\n\nVanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VHT) aims to replicate the performance of Spliced U.S. Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index1, which is a benchmark index measuring the investment return of healthcare stocks.

The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.\n\nEli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We believe the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.\u201d\n\n6. Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOT)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 11: 64.50%\n\nVanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOT) ranks 6th on our list of the best Vanguard ETFs to buy.

The revenue increased 20.3% year-over-year to $1.54 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were long Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 833,408 shares worth $196.2 million.\n\nIn addition to Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VGT), Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG), and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOT) is one of the best Vanguard ETFs to invest in.\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management stated the following regarding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe did a bit of portfolio sculpting during the year, with mixed results. We trimmed Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) several times during the year as it soared. Those trims, a very small one in March at roughly $163 and a larger one in August at $183, don\u2019t look smart with Arista finishing the year at $235 (and up more in January). Arista rose 94% this year. The good news is, Arista finished the year as our second largest holding, at 7.9% of the portfolio.\n\nIf you are wondering how I could sell some Arista at $163 but then hold most of it at $235, the answer is that Arista\u2019s outstanding competitive position in Artificial Intelligence became clearer to me as the year progressed. I felt in March that Arista would earn $8 per share in a few years. I see today that it might earn $8 in 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s possible there is AI-related froth in the Arista stock price, but also probable that Arista will continue to grow rapidly as the computing centers that process AI queries require enormous amounts of data bandwidth. I believe Arista\u2019s routers and switches are the best tools for routing so-called hyperscale traffic. Also, its operating software allows computer giants to manage the kudzu-like growth of their data centers, lowering their total cost of operation.\n\nThe sales of both Arista and Heico reflected my desire to manage PE multiple risk. I keep learning the hard way, however, that trimming your winners generally doesn\u2019t add value. If the valuation is beyond justification, sell the position. If the valuation is high but the business continues to dominate its niche, grow steadily and add value for customers, maybe just take a walk around the block until the urge to sell goes away.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5\u00a0Best Vanguard ETFs For 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Most Advanced Countries in Logistics Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 10 Stocks 16 Worst Jobs in the US in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a011 Best Vanguard ETFs For 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Michael Saylor: Bitcoin Can Compete With S&amp;P 500 ETFs",
        "content": "At the Bitcoin Atlantis conference in Madeira, Portugal, MicroStrategy Inc. Chairman Michael Saylor discussed Bitcoin and other topics with podcast host Natalie Brunell. One of the points of conversation surrounded the recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ETFs and their ability to compete with other top asset classes and ETFs.\n\n\"We thought that maybe Bitcoin was a competitor to gold, but it has actually run up the leaderboard, and now it's starting to nip at the heels of the S&P 500 Index ETFs,\" Saylor said.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today. About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?\n\nBitcoin and gold are viewed somewhat similarly by some investors, as they have a limited supply and can be seen as a hedge against inflation. However, gold has been around for millennia, while Bitcoin is barely 15 years old. Bitcoin has quickly risen the ranks and Saylor no longer sees gold as the main competitor to Bitcoin from an investment perspective.\n\nInstead, Saylor believes that Bitcoin has the potential to compete with the largest ETFs in the world, namely the S&P 500 index ETFs, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nIn terms of market cap, the S&P 500 is leaps and bounds ahead of Bitcoin. It has a market cap of over $40 trillion, well above Bitcoin's $1.3 trillion. However, Bitcoin's recent performance, according to Saylor, could be a sign that Bitcoin is ready to compete with some of the largest funds in the world.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched less than two months ago but have already surpassed more than $50 billion in combined total assets, according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETFs also saw a record amount of inflows during their first 30 days.\n\nTrending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets \u2014 has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?\n\nStory continues\n\n\"These ETFs opened up an entire financial world of awareness, opportunity and functionality to the 99% of mainstream investors. You really can't underestimate just how profoundly important that is to the entire network,\" Saylor noted.\n\nSaylor and Microstrategy are the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, amassing a stash of 193,000 Bitcoins over the past several years. The investment as a whole is up more than 100% and is currently worth over $13.5 billion.\n\nDespite the hugely successful investment, Saylor does not see the company selling any time soon. When asked about a potential exit strategy, Saylor said, \"Bitcoin is the exit strategy.\"\n\nNot only does Saylor not see an exit in the near future, but he is also taking on debt to buy more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy recently sold $700 million of convertible senior notes to buy even more Bitcoin.\n\nAs Bitcoin and spot ETFs continue to perform well and see more investment, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. Will Bitcoin ETFs catch up to the S&P 500 ETFs? Only time will tell.\n\nRead Next:\n\nBitcoin To $100,000?

        "content": "Count Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) as a skeptic of the artificial intelligence (AI) hype behind much of the recent stock market rally.\n\nIn a note published over the weekend titled \"The Current AI Bubble is Bigger than the 1990s Tech Bubble,\" Sl\u00f8k writes that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today have a higher forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio than the top 10 companies had in the mid-1990s during the tech bubble.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders. This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.\n\nA forward price-to-earnings ratio is a valuation metric that divides the current share price by the estimated next year's earnings per share. A lower ratio means that a stock is cheaper, all else being equal.\n\nThe median forward P/E ratio of the top 10 companies in the S&P today is around 40, while in 2000, at the peak of the tech bubble, the same metric was relatively much lower at only about 25.\n\nIt's not the first time Apollo Global's leading economist flagged valuation concerns among the market's largest companies.\n\nTrending: Fortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\nIn a note published on Jan. 9, Apollo pointed out that the market cap of the Magnificent Seven equaled the size of the Japanese, Canadian and U.K. markets combined.\n\nJust because a company has a high forward price-to-earnings ratio does not mean it will live up to its growth expectations. It's just that investors are leaving less margin of safety for any possible growth disappointments.\n\nExtra risk market concentration brings more risk if one or more of these high flyers cannot live up to its growth targets.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) tracks the S&P 500 index, a market cap-weighted index of large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe top 10 holdings of the SPDR ETF account for over 31% of its total assets, leaving passive index investors potentially more exposed to concentration risk than they might realize.\n\nWhether or not the AI bubble bursts or lives up to its high expectations is a question investors will have to tackle in the years to come. However, for those skeptical of valuations or market concentration, it might pay to remember the lessons from economist John Maynard Keynes, who shared that markets can stay irrational for longer than an investor can stay solvent.\n\nInvestors who have ridden the AI wave up have been rewarded. The S&P 500, led by its big tech components, is already up over 7% year to date. Meanwhile, small-cap exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without the major AI players, such as the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VB), have lagged, gaining just over 2% year to date.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhat decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?

        "content": "The Quantum Fund's historical performance is most often associated with Co-Founder George Soros. The fund achieved an average annual return of 30% from 1970-2000.\n\nPerhaps Soros's most famous bet came against the pound in 1992 when it netted his fund about $1 billion in one trade, considered by some to be the greatest currency trade of all time.\n\nHowever, Soros didn't start the Quantum Fund alone. Instead, he founded it alongside another now-famous investor, Jim Rogers. While Rogers left the fund in 1980 to \"retire\" and travel around the world on his motorcycle to search for international investment ideas, eventually turning his travel experiences into a best-selling book called \"Investment Biker,\" he continued to share his thoughts on the market.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Los Angeles startup is closing a real estate market gap worth hundreds of billions and you can invest in it with as little as $100. This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\n\nSeemingly, the best thing he can say about stocks at the moment is that it's not the right time to short them ... yet.\n\nIn a recent interview, Rogers shared that the world essentially is in an everything bubble, telling Soar Financially, \"Bonds are a bubble, property in many countries is a bubble, stocks are getting ready for a bubble.\"\n\nEven with his bearish conviction, he points out that he's \"not shorting yet because often at the end there\u2019s a blowoff and things get really crazy.\"\n\nTo play out his thesis as he waits for his planned short, Rogers is happy to sit in hard assets such as gold and silver, explaining \"everybody should have some silver and gold under the bed.\"\n\nTrending: Copy and paste Mark Cuban\u2019s startup investment strategyaccording to his colorful portfolio.\n\nInvestors who don't want the stress of storing the actual physical metal in their possession could consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) or the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV).\n\nStory continues\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Rogers has not been accurate with his predictions in recent years.\n\nIn 2011, he shared that there was a 100% chance of a crisis worse than in 2008.

        "content": "Citadel LLC is one of the largest hedge funds based in the U.S., with approximately $92.46 billion in total assets under management as of Sept. 30, 2023. Citadel has generated roughly $74 billion in total gains since its inception in 1990, making it the most successful hedge fund of all time.\n\nFounded by Ken Griffin, Citadel was the second best-performing fund in 2023, raking in approximately $8.1 billion in profits last year. Griffin, who serves as the CEO and co-chief investment officer for Citadel, is currently the 37th richest man in the world, with a total net worth of nearly $37 billion. Let's look at some of Citadel's largest holdings.\n\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, Citadel owned approximately 5.04 million shares of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and 15.02 million shares of Activision Blizzard, accounting for roughly 1.72% and 1.52% of the total portfolio, respectively. Citadel bought its stake in Activision Blizzard for a median price of $87.06 per share\n\nMicrosoft completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $95 per share, or $69 billion later in October last year. Following the acquisition, Citadel is estimated to have made a profit of over $119 million.\n\nShares of MSFT surged over 56% in fiscal 2023, making it one of the best-performing stocks in Citadel's portfolio. With a market cap of approximately $3.12 trillion, Microsoft is currently the most valuable in the world.\n\nThe company's extensive investments in AI over the past few years have been paying off, as its minority stake in ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to generate billions.\n\nIn the fiscal 2024 second quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 2023, Microsoft's total revenues rose 18% year-over-year to $62 billion, while EPS increased 33% from the same period last year to $2.93.\n\n\u201cWe've moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\u201d Satya Nadella, CEO and Chairman of Microsoft, said in the latest earnings release, \u201cBy infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we're winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.
