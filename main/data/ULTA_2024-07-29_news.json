As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance.

        "title": "Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this beauty products retailer have returned -4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, which Ulta falls in, has lost 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nUlta is expected to post earnings of $5.51 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.67 points to a change of -1.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.45 indicates a change of +10.8% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ulta is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Ulta, the consensus sales estimate of $2.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.5%. The $11.54 billion and $12.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3% and +5.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nUlta reported revenues of $2.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $6.47 for the same period compares with $6.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.37%. The EPS surprise was +4.52%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nUlta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Why Ulta (ULTA) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of beauty, cosmetics, and personal care retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) fell 6.1% in the afternoon session after Piper Sandler analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer downgraded the stock's rating from Overweight to Neutral and lowered the price target from $494 to $404, citing profitability concerns due to \"increased promotions and slower sales.\" The analyst added, \"We believe a rather lackluster long range plan come October [investor day] is probable, which could leave shares range-bound.\"\n\nHowever, Wolfmeyer also clarified that \"the downgrade is not a call to sell into the FQ2 print or the October investor day, but a view that it might take beyond the next 12 months to get share re-ignited.\"\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Ulta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nUlta's shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 3 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago, when the stock dropped 14.6% on the news that the company warned about cooling demand for beauty products at a J.P. Morgan conference. CEO Dave Kimbell added \"We have seen a slowdown in the total category...We came into the year \u2014 and we talked about this on our [earnings] call a few weeks ago \u2014 expecting the category to moderate. It has [had], as I said, several years of strong growth. We did not anticipate it would continue at the rate that it's been growing.\"\n\nUlta Beauty also expects comparable sales for the first quarter of the year to come in at the lower end of the first-half guidance for low single-digit growth provided during the Q4'2023 earnings call. Given the healthy growth reported in recent quarters, management anticipated some moderation heading into 2024.\n\nUlta is down 24.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $367.49 per share it is trading 35.2% below its 52-week high of $567.18 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Ulta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,041.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) closed the most recent trading day at $393.12, moving -1.84% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.78%.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Ulta (ULTA) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Ulta Beauty (ULTA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nUlta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy, representing 64% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ULTA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ULTA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Ulta here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Ulta, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ULTA a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Ulta, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $25.70.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Ulta. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Ulta with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon Prime Day: Consumers expected to spend nearly $14 billion during e-commerce holiday",
        "content": "Amazon's (AMZN) most anticipated deal event of the year is here.\n\nOn Tuesday, the e-commerce giant kicked off Prime Day, its annual two-day promotional event. Prime Day began nine years ago as a way to highlight the value of a Prime membership by offering deals and benefits for members.\n\n\"When it comes to Prime Day, Amazon still sets the agenda and takes the majority of sales,\" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves told Yahoo Finance (video above). \"We expect that US consumers will spend nearly $14 billion online during these two days.\"\n\nLast year, Prime Day brought in $13 billion in sales, with 60% of those sales coming from Amazon, while the rest came from third-party sellers, according to eMarketer. Prime members purchased more than 375 million items during the event last year, Amazon said, making it the \"biggest Prime Day event ever.\"\n\nThis year's Prime Day is expected to surpass that record, though the pace of revenue growth has slowed. Nearly 80% of online shoppers anticipate the best deals of the year, according to research conducted by marketing platform Skai.\n\nOther retailers such as Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), and Costco (COST) have followed Amazon by offering competing deals to boost sales. For instance, during Target's Circle Week, a seven-day sale that ran July 7-13, the retailer offered members of its loyalty rewards program up to 50% off clothing, skin care, fragrance, technology, and food items.\n\nThe shopping events come as consumer spending continues to hold up despite concerns over a slowing US economy. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, retail sales were flat in June, coming in better than the expected 0.3% decline.\n\nBeauty category expected to shine\n\nCanaves expects essential goods and beauty to outperform other categories.\n\n\"Beauty is a category where Amazon's online sales continue to outpace overall e-commerce growth for the category,\" Canaves said. \"And it's been a very strong, resilient category, and one where brands are keen to get on Amazon because so many consumers are there looking for beauty products.\"\n\nAmazon has been gaining share in health and beauty, one of its fastest-growing product categories. In addition to rivaling other retailers such as Ulta (ULTA) and Sephora (LVMUY), Morgan Stanley predicts Amazon will overtake Walmart as the US's top beauty retailer by 2025. An Amazon package moves along a conveyor belt at an Amazon's DAX7 delivery station during Amazon's annual Prime Day event on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, in South Gate, Calif. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nPart of Amazon's push into beauty has been expanding its offerings. Canaves pointed out that Amazon has recently attracted more premium brands, such as Clinique and Kiehl's.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a 2023 McKinsey & Company report, the \"premiumization\" trend in beauty and fragrance is expected to continue in the coming years. McKinsey estimates the prestige beauty category will grow 8% per year between 2022 and 2027 versus a 5% growth rate for mass beauty.\n\nThat's leading prestige brands who previously skipped over setting up an Amazon storefront to reconsider the marketplace.\n\n\"If the beauty brands aren't selling [products on Amazon], then third-party resellers will,\" she said.\n\nClick here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Trend Of High Returns At Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) Has Us Very Interested",
        "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Ulta Beauty's (NASDAQ:ULTA) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Ulta Beauty, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.40 = US$1.6b \u00f7 (US$5.6b - US$1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2024).\n\nSo, Ulta Beauty has an ROCE of 40%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Ulta Beauty's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Ulta Beauty  for free.\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nUlta Beauty is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 70% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Ulta Beauty's ROCE\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Ulta Beauty has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 17% to shareholders. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.\n\nLike most companies, Ulta Beauty does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Down 30% From Its 52-Week High, Is Now the Time to Buy Ulta Beauty Stock?",
        "content": "It's often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. In this case, the market hasn't been too fond of Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA), with the stock down about 30% from its 52-week high. Softer growth to start the year from this cosmetics retailer and hair salon operator has driven a reset of expectations in recent months.\n\nStill, I believe investors have several reasons to turn bullish on this category leader in a good position to rebound. Let's explore why shares of Ulta Beauty could make a beautiful addition to your portfolio now.\n\nMixed trends to start 2024\n\nThe first-quarter update from Ulta Beauty wasn't great, but deserves some important context.\n\nFor the period ended May 4, the company reported year-over-year net sales growth of 3.5%, a positive figure but also representing a slowdown compared to the 12.3% rate in the prior-year quarter. Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of $6.47 was down from $6.88 last year, but still up on a stacked two-year basis compared to $6.30 in Q1 2022.\n\nManagement noted the particularly strong comparison period at the start of 2023 and believes the current environment simply reflects a period of normalization following the post-pandemic boom. Nevertheless, the weaker-than-expected start to the year prompted an adjusted full-year guidance, which helps explain the stock price volatility in recent months.\n\nUlta Beauty now sees 2024 comparable sales growth between 2% and 3%, down from the prior 4% to 5% outlook. Similarly, a full-year EPS target of $25.20 to $26 compares to a higher $26.20 to $27 forecast range announced earlier this year, and the $26.03 result for 2023. ULTA Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe outlook remains positive\n\nMy takeaway is that despite the mixed trends, the big picture for Ulta Beauty remains positive. Sales and earnings have more than doubled over the past six years with the company continuing to generate profitable growth and strong underlying cash flows.\n\nFrom a high-level perspective, the company's shifting operating environment is part of a broader market theme. Even as the S&P 500 index continues to make new highs, several consumer-facing companies including Starbucks and Nike have all cited a headwind of customers turning more cautious toward discretionary spending.\n\nBy this measure, Ulta Beauty appears to be faring relatively well and stands out through its unique market positioning and business model. The one-stop shop for beauty supplies with more than nearly 1,400 locations, coupled with in-store salons and a major online presence has worked to redefine the industry.\n\nThe company's partnership with Target with more than 500 Ulta shop-in-shops as well as a deal with DoorDash to include Ulta items within its delivery marketplace highlights an omnichannel approach.\n\nStory continues\n\nE-commerce sales have been a strong point, with the company's app-based rewards program now counting 44 million loyalty members. The upside here is that these customers are recognized for a high level of engagement and repeat purchases. The ability to keep opening new stores and expand the ecosystem offers a path for significant long-term growth opportunities. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy I'm bullish on Ulta Beauty\n\nWith some confidence that Ulta Beauty's long-term strategy remains on track, I believe the stock is attractive at the current level.\n\nFollowing the large sell-off, there is a case to be made that the company's muted near-term trends have been sufficiently priced in, setting up the potential that upcoming quarterly results will outperform a low bar of expectations.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Ulta is trading under 16 times forward earnings as a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on the midpoint of management's 2024 EPS guidance. Notably, this multiple represents a discount compared to the average for the metric, which has been above 20 in the last three years.\n\nMy interpretation is that shares have good value at the current level and could be trading much higher by this time next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ulta Beauty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ulta Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Stocks to Watch: 7 Under-the-Radar Companies Quietly Building Empires",
        "content": "There are many under-the-radar stocks quietly building empires that stock investors should know about. These are the types of relatively unknown firms that create wealth for investors. However, as a result of being unknown, most investors have no idea of their virtues.\n\nA few of the names discussed below are somewhat well-known but none are household names in my mind. Each of these firms offers investors a lot to like and by getting in early the same investors can profit handsomely.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the biggest company names today were all once under-the-radar stocks as unknown companies brimming with potential. We\u2019re really talking about the essence of bargain hunting in the stock market. I believe every investor wants to find hidden gems before the broader market does. There\u2019s something about being able to say you invested in a company before it blew up that he\u2019s appealing to everyone. Let\u2019s look at several companies that currently exhibit that potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an emerging energy drink company that has garnered some attention but remains unknown at the same time. While many consumers are familiar with the brand it is not a household name by any means.\n\nIt is however a company that continues to quietly build an energy drink empire. The stock itself had recently gotten very hot as many investors began to queue in on its growth and overall strong performance. It has also been very volatile in 2024 swinging between highs near $100 on two occasions and subsequently falling back into the $50s several times.\n\nThe most recent decline followed a research note from Morgan Stanley suggesting that Celsius would suffer a modest market share decline. Yet Celsius also saw revenues increase by nearly 36% during the first quarter while gross margin rose above 50%. Perhaps Celsius will suffer as more competitors enter the energy strength space but as it stands now, Celsius also benefits from strong pricing power based on those gross margins.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefront\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an interesting potential choice among under-the-radar stocks. The stock itself has performed extraordinarily well over the past 5 years only to suffer more recently.\n\nThe reason is fairly straightforward: Ulta Beauty operates in a growing high-value beauty segment full of competition. Increased competition has forced the company to Revise its full-year forecast down slightly. That said, Ulta Beauty continues to deliver strong earnings that outpaced analyst expectations in the most recent quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Ulta Beauty is debt-free and has a $1 billion share buyback program that should deliver shareholder value moving forward. The point here is that although Ulta Beauty operates within a tough beauty sector and faces stiff competition outwardly, the company is still well run. That suggests to me that Ulta Beauty can rebound and deliver returns to investors while continuing to build its empire. Don\u2019t underestimate the fact that Ulta Beauty is debt-free. Being debt-free allows the company all sorts of latitude that other competitors don\u2019t enjoy.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK) is a stock and company that a lot of people will be entirely unfamiliar with. By simply looking at its name alone one might guess that the company sells camping goods or maybe even decks for houses.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a footwear company and owns both the UGGs and Hoka brands. The company owns other Footwear Brands but it is UGGs and Hoka that are propelling the company\u2019s empire forward. Sales of those two brands accounted for nearly $900 million in revenues in the fourth quarter alone. The company reported a record $4.2 billion in revenues for the full fiscal year 2023. Gross margins rose above 56% from 50% prior. Earnings per share increased by 51% during the same period.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corporation is very much unknown and strongly exemplifies what it is to be among under-the-radar stocks quietly building an empire. The strength of Hoka and UGGs should continue to benefit shareholders moving forward.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is something of a behind-the-scenes player in the semiconductor sector and a stock worth buying.\n\nThe company designs the CPUs, GPUs, and other chip components that remain vital to the semiconductor industry today. It then licenses that intellectual property to other chip companies which can customize to their specific needs. ARM also sells software that allows developers to customize its processors.\n\nBeing so heavily involved in the semiconductor sector of course means that Arm Holdings is an artificial intelligence play. That has also raised questions regarding its valuation which is currently close to a high target price. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the valuation concerns, instead focusing on the fact that the company is expected to provide 20% or greater top-line growth for the next several years while also drastically increasing earnings this year and into the future. Arm Holdings continues to be like other smart, under-the-radar stocks in the AI chip opportunity.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) Is a popular stock choice in the growing cybersecurity sector. The company is quietly becoming one of the go-to choices for all things related to internet security.\n\nMoreover, NET is well known for all kinds of security-related services including the prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The company also stores website content on its servers located in more than 320 cities globally. Generally speaking, Cloudflare is becoming better known, especially in light of growing concerns around security and artificial intelligence. That provides the company with a strong opportunity to grow and improve fundamentally.\n\nThe company indeed looks to be hitting its stride from a fundamental perspective. historically, the company has not provided net earnings overall in any given fiscal year. that is expected to change in 2024 when earnings per share will swing from -55 cents to 64 cents. Earnings are expected to continue to improve while top-line growth approaches 30% over the next several years.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Man holding a mobile with PinDuoDuo (PDD) logo at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of the best under-the-radar e-commerce plays available to investors anywhere. The company owns the Chinese discount shopping app Pinduoduo and a growing Temu marketplace that is quickly becoming an empire.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, revenues more than doubled to the US dollar equivalent of $12.02 billion. Net income more than tripled, growing by 246% during the same period to $3.87 billion.\n\nYet PDD Holdings continues to be undervalued on broader fears related to the Chinese economy. While the Chinese economy is certainly facing its share of trouble it is obvious that the e-commerce sector continues to offer plenty of opportunities. PDD Holdings is very clearly capitalizing on that opportunity and makes a lot of sense at the moment.\n\nThe company also recently introduced a consignment model that pushes logistics costs onto merchants. That should serve to further boost earnings at the already thriving company.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) will continue to grow due to the versatility of its platform. In turn, its stock should continue to grow as the company builds its empire.\n\nRoblox is available for use on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and the Xbox. The creator content-driven platform offering millions of experiences is available to a broad user base. It appeals to developers who leverage that platform to create unique experiences hosted on the platform. Meanwhile, the platform also allows social experiences that drive engagement and appeal especially as life moves more online.\n\nRevenues at\u00a0 Roblox are expected to rise by 47% overall in 2024. Sales are expected to double between 2023 and 2026. The platform is undergoing a period of rapid growth. That growth is the primary reason to invest in the company which projects to continue to produce losses for the next several years. The other thing to note about Roblox is that there must be incredible experiences housed on the platform that have simply gone unnoticed to date. It\u2019s a treasure trove of experiences that could become popular moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.70 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 25, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $1.70 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.65 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Texas Roadhouse has an Earnings ESP of 3.34%.\n\nTXRH is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Ulta Beauty (ULTA).\n\nUlta Beauty, which is readying to report earnings on August 22, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.56 a share, and ULTA is 41 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ulta Beauty is $5.52, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.74%.\n\nTXRH and ULTA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) closed the latest trading day at $400.82, indicating a +1.21% change from the previous session's end. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.88%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.08%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.95%.\n\nThe the stock of beauty products retailer has risen by 1.51% in the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.55% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.11%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Ulta Beauty in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.52, showcasing an 8.31% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $2.62 billion, indicating a 3.67% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nULTA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $25.77 per share and revenue of $11.56 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -1% and +3.12%, respectively.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Ulta Beauty should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

        "content": "Multibagger stocks can help you reach your financial goals sooner. And, many growth stocks have enjoyed incredible rallies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the multibagger on everyone\u2019s mind. While the artificial intelligence (AI) leader can still generate higher returns for long-term investors, it\u2019s been thrown into the open.\n\nFinding hidden multibaggers can lead to higher long-term gains. Although Nvidia has gained more than 3,000% over the past five years, it\u2019s unlikely to repeat that growth over the next five years. While it\u2019s difficult for any stock to achieve those returns, it\u2019s possible to find stocks that more than double within a few years.\n\nTherefore, investors should set their horizons on companies that have rising revenue and profit margin growth. And these corporations with long-term catalysts can spark further stock gains. These three stocks fulfill those parameters, but they aren\u2019t as well-known. None of these stocks are currently in the S&P 500 and remain hidden. Let\u2019s uncover them now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational tech company that makes it easier for people to learn new languages. The company offers verbal and written activities to assist people on the language learning journey. The gamified experience keeps people coming back, based on Duolingo\u2019s 31.4 million daily active users. That\u2019s a 54% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Additionally, the number of monthly active users jumped by 35% YOY to reach 97.6 million.\n\nMoreover, revenue and earnings growth rates remained elevated as more people flocked to the Duolingo app. Revenue increased by 45% YOY while net income reached $27.0 million. That\u2019s a big turnaround from the company\u2019s $2.6 million net loss in the same quarter last year.\n\nNotably, Duolingo is quickly gaining momentum and is up by 37% over the past year. The stock has a high P/E ratio, but net profit margins have been soaring. Hence, higher profits and continued revenue growth can make the $8 billion corporation attractive for long-term investors.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant stocks have taken off in recent years. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been\u00a0 capturing plenty of attention as it\u2019s more than quadrupled over the past five years. A recent 50-for-1 stock split has made Chipotle more affordable on a price-per-share perspective, further bringing more attention to the stock.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t about Chipotle. It\u2019s about Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH). The steakhouse chain has also benefitted from the growing demand for restaurant stocks. Shares are up by 40% year-to-date (YTD), more than tripling over the past five years. Yet, Texas Roadhouse still has a reasonable 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.46% yield. Very few high-growth restaurant stocks offer a decent P/E ratio and a dividend. Most of them offer neither.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company reported 12.5% YOY revenue growth and 31.0% YOY net income growth in the first quarter. Comparable restaurant sales jumped by 8.4% YOY, demonstrating plenty of demand for the company\u2019s restaurants. Texas Roadhouse has 753 restaurants. The company owns 644 of those restaurants, and the remaining 109 restaurants are franchises.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is closing in on S&P 500 eligibility. The cosmetics firm has gained more than 1,300% over the past five years. Shares are up by 45% YTD amid strong financials. Elf Beauty reported 71% YOY revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The company has now reported 21 consecutive quarters of net sales and market growth. Also, Elf Beauty gained market share for the 5th consecutive year while other beauty firms like Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) are reporting decelerating sales growth.\n\nIn addition, Elf Beauty caters to Gen Z and other generations for using cruelty-free ingredients in its beauty products. The efforts have paid off based on recent financial results. Elf Beauty\u2019s fiscal 2025 outlook suggests the stock can gain more ground.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Lululemon LULU, Nike NKE, Ulta Beauty ULTA and ON Semiconductor ON.\n\n3 Great Stocks to Buy on the Dip for July\n\nToday's episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into where the market stands heading into July and the second half of 2024. The episode then explores three hard-hit S&P 500 stocks trading at least 30% below their highs that investors might want to buy on the dip to start the third quarter.\n\nThe stock market's boring two-day stretch on Wednesday and Thursday came after the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq bounced back on Tuesday to end a three-session skid.\n\nThe Nasdaq found buyers before it had to test its 21-day moving average. The question is whether the bulls race to fresh highs before the start of Q2 earnings season, or take more profits heading into the Fourth of July?\n\nThankfully, no matter what happens in the near term, the Wall Street bulls have the two biggest driving forces propelling them forward: earnings growth and rate cuts.\n\nInvestors should focus on taking advantage of the next market pullback whenever it comes and look for strong stocks that have already been punished for fading earnings outlooks and other near-term headwinds in the first half of 2024.\n\nLululemon\n\nLululemon has tumbled 40% in 2024 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in a key demographic amid challenges from rivals Alo and Vuori and changing fashion trends. The athleisure firm is coming up against a very difficult to compete against stretch of growth and the law of large numbers means its YoY expansion won't look as impressive.\n\nThese are real concerns and LULU's outlook showcases significantly lower sales and EPS growth. But Lululemon averaged 25% sales expansion in the past five years and grew its adjusted EPS by 27% last year and 30% in 2022. Lululemon is projected to post 11.4% revenue growth in FY24 and 10% higher sales next year to boost its adjusted EPS by 12% and 10%, respectively.\n\nLululemon is set to make up for slowing growth in its U.S. women's segment by doubling men's and e-commerce and quadrupling international sales between 2021 and 2026. Lululemon's margins remain almost unmatched in the non-luxury apparel space. On top of that, LULU's FY24 and FY25 earnings estimates remain above where they were 12 months ago.\n\nLULU has climbed 660% in the past 10 years to blow away the S&P 500's 190%, Nike's 140%, and its industry's 18% downturn. Yet, Lululemon trades 40% below its peaks in terms of price and at a 70% discount to its highs at 20.5X forward earnings, which is near its decade-long lows.\n\nStory continues\n\nLululemon appears to be finding support around its lows over the last four years while trading at historically oversold RSI levels. Plus, it has no debt and boosted its stock buyback program by $1 billion.\n\nUlta Beauty\n\nUlta Beauty is the largest specialty U.S. beauty retailer. The firm reshaped the industry over the last 30-plus years by bringing the entire cosmetic and beauty space under one roof. Ulta sells an array of brands across multiple areas and price points from higher-end companies to its store brands.\n\nUlta operates roughly 1,400 locations across the U.S. Ulta's e-commerce offerings have gained traction and it's benefitting from growth in how-to-style videos, tips, and tutorials across social media and beyond.\n\nUlta shares soared off their Covid lows until they tumbled between May 2023 and October 2023. Ulta went on another massive boom and bust run that sent it to fresh highs in March 2024.\n\nThe stock has plummeted 33% since then, driven lower by slowing comparable sales growth as consumers pullback on spending. Ulta's lower-income shoppers are being hit hard by inflation and are fading after several years of blowout spending.\n\nUlta's consensus earnings estimates for FY24 and FY25 are down just 3.5% over the last year. On top of that, beauty is historically resilient during economic uncertainty when people choose to spend money on the little things. Ulta is projected to post 3% revenue growth in FY24 and 6% higher sales next year, while its adjusted EPS dips slightly this year and jumps 11% higher next year.\n\nUlta shares are up 13% in the last three years vs. the Zacks Retail sector's 7% drop. This is part of a 300% run in the last decade to destroy the benchmark and its sector. Ulta trades 32% below its highs and 25% under its average Zacks price target.\n\nUlta appears to be finding support at its lows over the last three years as it hovers just below its 200-week moving average and at historically oversold levels. Ulta also trades at a 60% discount to its highs and 35% below its sector at 14.4X forward earnings (lowest levels outside of the Covid selloff).\n\nON Semiconductor\n\nON Semiconductor operates in the important but less flashy analog segment of the chip industry. ON Semiconductor's solutions play key roles in the industrial and automotive markets.\n\nON has thrived in the connected vehicle world and expanded on the back of EVs, energy storage, solar energy, and much more. \"As power continues to play a critical role in the world's increasing energy demands, efficiency is paramount, and we are positioned to continue to gain share with our portfolio of industry-leading power and sensing technologies,\" CEO Hassane El-Khoury said last quarter.\n\nON Semiconductor has been rocked by a cyclical downturn across the industrial and automotive sectors. ON's fiscal 2024 earnings estimate has tumbled 24% over the last 12 months, with its FY25 outlook 17% lower.\n\nON Semiconductor's adjusted FY24 earnings are projected to fall 26% YoY on 13% lower sales. This downturn isn't uncommon in the historically cyclical industry, and ON is projected to post 10% revenue growth next year and 27% higher adjusted EPS.\n\nON Semiconductor shares have fallen around 37% from their 2023 peaks. ON is down 25% over the last year vs. Tech's 40% run and the Zacks Semiconductor market's 110% AI-fueled boom. The recent divergence means ON lags firmly behind the chip industry over the past 10 years. Still, its 630% run nearly doubles the Tech sector.\n\nON trades around where it was in late 2021 and 24% below its average Zacks price target. ON Semiconductor trades between its 21-month and 50-month moving averages and below neutral RSI levels. ON stock trades 40% below its highs, 60% below the chip industry, and at a 45% discount to the Zacks Tech sector.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "This Market-Beating Stock Is a Beautiful Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Beauty and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA)'s price action has been anything but pretty over the past six months. Slowing growth and slipping profit margins have caused the stock to falter; shares have fallen from nearly $600 to under $400 in just the past six months.\n\nAlthough the stock had reasons for slipping, the stock market often gets overzealous. There's a solid argument that Ulta Beauty's selling has gone too far, and shares are poised to rebound strongly. Here is why Ulta Beauty is a beautiful buy for investors right now.\n\nWhy has the stock fallen so much?\n\nBeauty and cosmetics are cultural staples, not just in America, but worldwide. Ulta Beauty is the largest cosmetics retailer in the United States, with 1,395 stores and an e-commerce store. It sells tens of thousands of products from hundreds of brands. Ulta has also become a full-fledged brand; the company engages with customers through social media and loyalty programs.\n\nUlta had just 449 stores in 2011. Steadily opening new stores has fueled relatively uninterrupted sales growth for years outside the pandemic, which hurt virtually any business with physical stores. Consistent, profitable growth has made Ulta Beauty a market-beater; the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 roughly 3-to-1 since the company's IPO in 2007.\n\nConsumers were flush with cash coming out of the pandemic, which boosted Ulta's business. However, those tailwinds have faded. Sales growth has steadily slowed since peaking in 2021, while gross profit margins peaked in late 2022: ULTA Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nManagement has pointed to increased theft and lower-margin sales as the culprits behind margin pressures. That makes sense; consumer savings rates have fallen below pre-pandemic levels. Naturally, a retailer will struggle if shoppers have less money and are trading down to cheaper brands. As much as people may try to maintain their beauty regimen, cosmetics are ultimately a discretionary budget item.\n\nIt's not all bad\n\nThe good news is that Ulta Beauty's formula for success has worked for many years, and there isn't much reason to believe it won't continue.\n\nThe company is still opening new stores and remodeling existing locations. Management forecasts 60 to 65 new store openings in 2024 and another 40 to 45 remodels. New stores will boost total locations by 4% to 5%, which essentially builds low-single-digit revenue growth into the business.\n\nRemodels and an eventual consumer recovery should boost sales at existing stores. Analysts believe Ulta Beauty's annual revenue growth will average between 5% and 6% over the long term.\n\nStory continues ULTA Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nUlta Beauty's margin declines aren't necessarily a reason to panic. Today's gross margins of 38.9% are still notably higher than before the pandemic, when Ulta's margins were roughly 36%. The company's free cash flow is still within shouting distance of decade highs, which should continue to fuel future share repurchases. It has reduced its share count by 26% over the past decade, which helps drive earnings-per-share growth.\n\nUltimately, investors must determine whether Ulta Beauty can continue driving long-term growth. Nothing here seems to indicate that it can't.\n\nThe selling has gone far enough\n\nThe market has aggressively sold off Ulta Beauty stock over the past few months, and shares have become cheap. The company averaged a price-to-earnings ratio of 32 over the past decade. Today, Ulta Beauty is trading at just 15 times its estimated 2024 earnings -- less than half its long-term average valuation.\n\nIt would make sense if Ulta Beauty's business were severely damaged, but that doesn't seem to be the case, as discussed. Additionally, analysts are optimistic and expect the company to grow earnings by an average of over 12% annually over the long term.\n\nThere is a famous saying that the stock market can sometimes be irrational. That saying works in both directions, meaning stocks can become remarkably expensive or cheap, depending on Wall Street's whims. Ulta Beauty has fallen out of style, and the market has used some legitimate short-term speed bumps to sell the stock into the ground unfairly.\n\nThe stock is a bargain at this price, making it a compelling buy for long-term investors willing to wait for these challenges to subside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ulta Beauty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ulta Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Ulta Beauty (ULTA) standing at $385.87, reflecting a -0.02% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.41% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.71%.\n\nShares of the beauty products retailer witnessed a gain of 0.1% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its gain of 2.65% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.53%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Ulta Beauty in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.52, showcasing an 8.31% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $2.62 billion, indicating a 3.67% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $25.77 per share and revenue of $11.56 billion, which would represent changes of -1% and +3.12%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Ulta Beauty. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

Ulta Beauty is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Ulta Beauty is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.98. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.39, so one might conclude that Ulta Beauty is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nWe can also see that ULTA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Retail - Miscellaneous industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.68.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Retail - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 190, positioning it in the bottom 25% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company's ability to generate traffic growth across both its physical stores and digital channels is a testament to its powerful operating model and excellent brand partnerships. By increasing marketing investments across TV, audio, and social platforms, Ulta Beauty has effectively captured a broader audience and reinforced its market presence.\r\n\r\nUlta Beauty has been witnessing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out, thanks to consumers\u2019 rising interest in self-care and the company\u2019s focus on newness and innovation. The trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein the skincare category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth. This was backed by solid growth in body care and mass skin care. Results largely gained from the launch of Sol de Janeiro and the expansion of core emerging brands into additional Ulta Beauty stores.\u00a0 Guests\u2019 increased focus on self-care and maintaining healthy skincare routines keeps the skincare category well-positioned for continued growth.\n\nNear-term Challenges\n\nUlta Beauty\u2019s SG&A expenses have been rising year over year for a while now. Management expects SG&A deleverage in fiscal 2024 due to sales-driving investments (including marketing and store labor), efforts related to the transformational agenda and initiatives to operationalize investments made in 2023. SG&A is expected to increase by mid-to-high-single digits in fiscal 2024, including a low-double-digit increase in the first half and low-to-mid-single-digit growth in the second half.\r\n\r\nConsequently, management trimmed its operating margin guidance for fiscal 2024. They expect an operating margin between 13.7% and 14% now compared with the previously mentioned 14%-14.3%. The company also expects the gross margin to decline modestly in fiscal 2024 due to soft merchandise margins and fixed cost deleverage. Shares of the company have tumbled 26.2% in the past three months, compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 12%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWrapping Up\n\nDespite anticipated moderation in growth following three years of unprecedented expansion and increasing competitive intensity, Ulta Beauty remains well-positioned to protect and expand its leadership role in the industry. The company\u2019s progress across key business areas, with its strong culture and outstanding team, positions it well for sustained growth and enhanced market leadership.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nUlta Beauty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\n3 Strong Bets\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch ANF, a specialty retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANF\u2019s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 10.4% and 47.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.

        "title": "7 Dividend Kings to Buy With Your Roth IRA Money in 2024",
        "content": "Investing in Dividend Kings through a Roth IRA presents a special opportunity. Not only do you benefit from the tax-free growth and withdrawals that a Roth IRA offers, but you also harness the power of compounding dividends from some of the most dependable companies in the market. This strategy can significantly compound your retirement savings over time.\n\nHowever, not all Dividend Kings are great buys for your Roth IRA. Some companies hike up their dividends to keep up the record while their businesses underperform. It is best to avoid such companies and put your money into the stickiest names out there while also allocating some money to solid dividend stocks with upside potential. Here are seven to look into.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) needs no introduction. I believe PepsiCo is one of the most compelling Dividend King stocks you can buy right now for your Roth IRA, if not the most compelling one.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn Q1 2024, PepsiCo repeated the consistency and stability that I love about this company. Net revenue grew a solid 2.26% year-over-year to $18.25 billion, beating estimates by nearly $146 million. Earnings per share also impressed at $1.61, exceeding expectations by 9 cents.\n\nWhat really caught my attention was the stellar performance of PepsiCo\u2019s international businesses. International sales have reached a staggering $36 billion and are growing at an impressive high single-digit rate with robust profitability.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s omnipresent snack and beverage portfolio gives it one of the stickiest, most resilient sales profiles around. Dividend kings for ROTH IRA: PEP dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith a 3.25% forward dividend yield and 53 consecutive years of dividend increases, PepsiCo is a cornerstone holding for steady long-term returns. I view any pullback as an attractive buying opportunity for this Dividend King.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a biopharmaceutical company. I must say, the latest earnings report from AbbVie is very encouraging. And if I were to recommend one big biopharma stock right now, it would have to be ABBV. The biopharmaceutical industry may not be the most stable, and a lot of the growth relies on new drug discoveries and hinges on approval from the FDA. However, I think big biopharma companies are still pretty safe. The medical industry is growing very fast and will likely keep growing even faster as the population ages and, unfortunately, becomes more unhealthy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.31, beating expectations by 8 cents, on revenue of $12.31 billion that grew 0.7% YOY and also surpassed estimates by an impressive $374 million. This solid performance shows that the company is successfully navigating the U.S. loss of exclusivity for Humira.\n\nLooking ahead, I\u2019m increasingly confident that AbbVie\u2019s pipeline positions it strongly for sustained long-term growth. ABBV dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith the stock offering an attractive 3.62% forward dividend yield and an unmatched track record of 52 consecutive years of dividend increases, income investors should find a lot to like here.\n\nAll things considered, AbbVie looks like a high-quality biopharma giant that dividend growth investors can count on to deliver reliable income and capital appreciation for years to come.\n\nConsolidated Edison (ED) Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.\n\nSource: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) is a regulated utility that provides electric, gas, and steam service in New York City and Westchester County, New York. I believe this Dividend King is a very attractive long-term buy for your Roth IRA, especially if you\u2019re looking for a steady compounder with 51 straight years of dividend increases.\n\nIn Q1 2024, ED reported solid adjusted EPS of $2.15, up 17.5% YOY, driven by strong rate base growth. Management is investing heavily to protect their equipment from climate change and build a grid capable of delivering 100% clean energy. They also gained approval for a $1.2 billion project to meet growing electricity demand. This bodes well for future earnings growth.\n\nWhile utilities may not be the most exciting sector, their stability is unmatched. Volatile commodity prices, like natural gas, have little impact on their bottom line since fuel costs are largely passed through to customers. This makes ED\u2019s 3.7% dividend yield extremely reliable. ED dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith management reaffirming their full-year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.20 to $5.40, I\u2019m confident ED will continue its impressive dividend growth streak for many years to come. It\u2019s a true sleep-well-at-night stock for your Roth.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola Consolidated sign outside of their building. COKE Stock.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a global beverage company renowned for its iconic soft drinks. In my view, this dividend king deserves a prime spot in your Roth IRA thanks to its unbeatable brand and impressive growth potential. While Q1 2024 saw some mixed results across regions, Coca-Cola\u2019s overall performance remained solid with 7% comparable EPS growth despite significant currency headwinds.\n\nIts execution of an all-weather strategy is paying off, as evidenced by volume growth, margin expansion, and continued investments. It has been gaining momentum in key markets like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. And although China\u2019s recovery remains gradual, I believe Coca-Cola\u2019s long-term prospects there are bright.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts expect Coca-Cola to deliver around 5% annual sales growth and 6% annual EPS growth over the next decade. That\u2019s impressive for a company of this size and maturity. Plus, there\u2019s significant upside potential from a weakening U.S. dollar as interest rates eventually decline. Since 2018, dollar strength has reduced Coca-Cola\u2019s earnings by a staggering 31%. But I anticipate this headwind turning into a tailwind in the coming years. KO Dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe stock comes with a 3% dividend yield, rising for 63 years straight.\n\nTarget Corporation (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) is one of America\u2019s largest retailers. While many assume a mature company like Target would have a stable stock, it has experienced significant volatility in recent years due to the 2021 boom and 2022 bust. However, I believe Target presents a compelling investment opportunity right now, especially for dividend-focused Roth IRA portfolios.\n\nThe company is now focusing on AI, e-commerce and loyalty programs to drive future growth. They\u2019re also investing in new stores and recent partnerships like the one with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA).\n\nOnce interest rate cuts kick in, I expect consumer discretionary businesses like Target to benefit. The recent dividend hikes have been very generous recently. TGT dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe 3% dividend yield and 54 consecutive years of dividend increases add to its solidity.\n\nQ1 sales missed slightly. Nevertheless, EPS came in near the high end of guidance. Target affirmed its full-year outlook, and I\u2019m confident they\u2019re on track to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead.\n\nBlack Hills (BKH) Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant with sunset and light orange. Best natural gas stocks to buy.\n\nSource: Rangsarit Chaiyakun / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlack Hills (NYSE:BKH) is a diversified energy company that provides electric and natural gas services in eight states. While the stock has been battered in the post-pandemic era, being down 35.5% from its pre-COVID peak, I believe this presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, especially those looking for reliable income in their Roth IRA. BKH dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company has 54 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt. Plus, the current yield of 4.86% is quite juicy and well above the broader market average. I think patient investors can park some cash here, collect that rock-solid payout, and wait for the eventual recovery.\n\nOn that front, they are seeing strong customer growth. Migration trends are to thank for that. Moreover, the ongoing data center boom is driving increased demand for electricity in their service territories. In fact, management is planning an additional 400 megawatts of renewable energy projects to meet this rising demand.\n\nRLI Corp (RLI) Man in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home. Represents insurance.\n\nSource: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.com\n\nRLI (NYSE:RLI) provides specialty insurance and surety solutions. Insurance companies like RLI tend to be some of the most stable and consistent dividend payers, and I believe RLI is the cream of the crop among insurance Dividend Kings. In Q1, RLI delivered stellar results with hefty beats on both revenue and earnings. Revenue surged nearly 22% to $445 million, blowing past estimates by $50 million. Meanwhile, EPS of $1.89 topped expectations by an impressive 28 cents.\n\nManagement emphasized that they\u2019re leaning into opportunities where RLI has the expertise to shine while remaining disciplined in riskier areas. This balanced approach is paying off, with all segments posting double-digit growth and underwriting profits. RLI\u2019s investment income is also on a tear, jumping 21% as its book yield and asset base expand. RLI dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith 50 consecutive years of dividend hikes under its belt, RLI\u2019s 0.84% yield may not jump off the page. But don\u2019t be fooled, this company\u2019s impressive compounding power more than makes up for it. RLI shares have soared 62% in the last five years alone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Great Stocks to Buy on the Dip in July Down At Least 30%",
        "content": "Today\u2019s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into where the market stands heading into July and the second half of 2024. The episode then explores three hard-hit S&P 500 stocks\u2014Lululemon (LULU), ON Semiconductor (ON), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)\u2014trading at least 30% below their highs that investors might want to buy on the dip to start the third quarter.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s boring two-day stretch on Wednesday and Thursday came after the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq bounced back on Tuesday to end a three-session skid.\n\nThe Nasdaq found buyers before it had to test its 21-day moving average. The question is whether the bulls race to fresh highs before the start of Q2 earnings season, or take more profits heading into the Fourth of July?\n\nThankfully, no matter what happens in the near term, the Wall Street bulls have the two biggest driving forces propelling them forward: earnings growth and rate cuts.\n\nInvestors should focus on taking advantage of the next market pullback whenever it comes and look for strong stocks that have already been punished for fading earnings outlooks and other near-term headwinds in the first half of 2024.\n\nLululemon (LULU)\n\nLululemon has tumbled 40% in 2024 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in a key demographic amid challenges from rivals Alo and Vuori and changing fashion trends. The athleisure firm is coming up against a very difficult to compete against stretch of growth and the law of large numbers means its YoY expansion won\u2019t look as impressive. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThese are real concerns and LULU\u2019s outlook showcases significantly lower sales and EPS growth. But Lululemon averaged 25% sales expansion in the past five years and grew its adjusted EPS by 27% last year and 30% in 2022. Lululemon is projected to post 11.4% revenue growth in FY24 and 10% higher sales next year to boost its adjusted EPS by 12% and 10%, respectively.\n\nLululemon is set to make up for slowing growth in its U.S. women\u2019s segment by doubling men's and e-commerce and quadrupling international sales between 2021 and 2026. Lululemon\u2019s margins remain almost unmatched in the nonluxury apparel space. On top of that, LULU\u2019s FY24 and FY25 earnings estimates remain above where they were 12 months ago. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLULU has climbed 660% in the past 10 years to blow away the S&P 500\u2019s 190%, Nike\u2019s (NKE) 140%, and its industry\u2019s 18% downturn. Yet, Lululemon trades 40% below its peaks in terms of price and at a 70% discount to its highs at 20.5X forward earnings, which is near its decade-long lows.\n\nStory continues\n\nLululemon appears to be finding support around its lows over the last four years while trading at historically oversold RSI levels. Plus, it has no debt and boosted its stock buyback program by $1 billion.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA)\n\nUlta Beauty is the largest specialty U.S. beauty retailer. The firm reshaped the industry over the last 30-plus years by bringing the entire cosmetic and beauty space under one roof. Ulta sells an array of brands across multiple areas and price points from higher-end companies to its store brands.\n\nUlta operates roughly 1,400 locations across the U.S. Ulta\u2019s e-commerce offerings have gained traction and it\u2019s benefitting from growth in how-to-style videos, tips, and tutorials across social media and beyond. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUlta shares soared off their Covid lows until they tumbled between May 2023 and October 2023. Ulta went on another massive boom and bust run that sent it to fresh highs in March 2024.\n\nThe stock has plummeted 33% since then, driven lower by slowing comparable sales growth as consumers pullback on spending. Ulta\u2019s lower-income shoppers are being hit hard by inflation and are fading after several years of blowout spending.\n\nUlta\u2019s consensus earnings estimates for FY24 and FY25 are down just 3.5% over the last year. On top of that, beauty is historically resilient during economic uncertainty when people choose to spend money on the little things. Ulta is projected to post 3% revenue growth in FY24 and 6% higher sales next year, while its adjusted EPS dips slightly this year and jumps 11% higher next year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUlta shares are up 13% in the last three years vs. the Zacks Retail sector\u2019s 7% drop. This is part of a 300% run the last decade to destroy the benchmark and its sector. Ulta trades 32% below its highs and 25% under its average Zacks price target.\n\nUlta appears to be finding support at its lows over the last three years as it hovers just below its 200-week moving average and at historically oversold levels. Ulta also trades at a 60% discount to its highs and 35% below its sector at 14.4X forward earnings (lowest levels outside of the Covid selloff).\n\nON Semiconductor (ON)\n\nON Semiconductor operates in the important but less flashy analog segment of the chip industry. ON Semiconductor\u2019s solutions play key roles in the industrial and automotive markets.\n\nON has thrived in the connected vehicle world and expanded on the back of EVs, energy storage, solar energy, and much more. \u201cAs power continues to play a critical role in the world\u2019s increasing energy demands, efficiency is paramount, and we are positioned to continue to gain share with our portfolio of industry-leading power and sensing technologies,\u201d CEO Hassane El-Khoury said last quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nON Semiconductor has been rocked by a cyclical downturn across the industrial and automotive sectors. ON\u2019s fiscal 2024 earnings estimate has tumbled 24% over the last 12 months, with its FY25 outlook 17% lower.\n\nON Semiconductor\u2019s adjusted FY24 earnings are projected to fall 26% YoY on 13% lower sales. This downturn isn\u2019t uncommon in the historically cyclical industry, and ON is projected to post 10% revenue growth next year and 27% higher adjusted EPS.\n\nON Semiconductor shares have fallen around 37% from their 2023 peaks. ON is down 25% over the last year vs. Tech\u2019s 40% run and the Zacks Semiconductor market\u2019s 110% AI-fueled boom. The recent divergence means ON lags firmly behind the chip industry over the past 10 years. Still, its 630% run nearly doubles the Tech sector. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nON trades around where it was in late 2021 and 24% below its average Zacks price target. ON Semiconductor trades between its 21-month and 50-month moving averages and below neutral RSI levels. ON stock trades 40% below its highs, 60% below the chip industry, and at a 45% discount to the Zacks Tech sector.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com - Analysts at Evercore highlighted L\u2019Oreal's (EPA:OREP) decision to revise its global beauty market growth forecast from 5.0% to a range of 4.5-5.0%. This adjustment comes in response to market volatility in China and a \"slightly negative\" 6.18 shopping festival.\n\nL'Oreal's stock has experienced a dip following the announcement by CEO Nicolas Hieronimus. This development aligns with Evercore's anticipation of a pullback in China's beauty sales for June due to timing and consumer sentiment issues.\n\nDespite the downtick in net sales during China's 6.18 shopping festival, gross sales for L'Oreal have reportedly increased, indicating an uptick in promotional activities.\n\nIn the US, L'Oreal's growth is slowing due to a decline in mass makeup sales. However, prestige fragrances continue to perform strongly. According to Circana data, which includes Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) for mass products, L'Oreal-USA's growth is pegged at 2%, slightly lower than in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nReported sales, however, grew by 11% due to the timing of shipments and stronger sales for the Luxury and Professional divisions.\n\nL'Oreal continues to outperform in the US prestige segment, particularly in fragrances and makeup. This is in part due to L'Oreal launching Lanc\u00f4me and other prestige brands on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Premium, which is now the largest beauty retailer in the US.\n\nAnalysts predict a 5.8% like-for-like sales increase in the second quarter, driven by a 9.7% rebound in Luxury after two quarters of +2-3%, reflecting Hainan destocking.\n\nDespite some anticipated deceleration, Evercore maintains a more conservative forecast of 4.9%.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nL'Oreal adjusts global beauty forecast amid China's market volatility\n\nStocks mixed, bond yields dip after US economic data\n\nNokia considering potential acquisition of Infinera, Bloomberg News reports\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) Potentially Undervalued?",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$532 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$376. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ulta Beauty's current trading price of US$388 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Ulta Beauty\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nView our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty\n\nWhat Is Ulta Beauty Worth?\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Ulta Beauty is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $551.13, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Ulta Beauty\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Ulta Beauty generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 13% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Ulta Beauty. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since ULTA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on ULTA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy ULTA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

        "title": "3 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "For growth-oriented opportunities, many investors turn to Nasdaq-listed enterprises for good reason. Generally, they\u2019re younger and thus offer significant upside potential compared to your average New York Stock Exchange-listed blue chips. To add even more oomph to your holdings, you can elect Nasdaq stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nHere, we\u2019re talking about publicly traded companies that offer relevant businesses that simply encountered a rough patch. But because the underlying fundamentals are solid, they have (likely) a better-than-average chance of jumping higher. Granted, adopting this approach is a double-edged sword. By always swinging for the fences, your batting average may suffer.\n\nAt the same time, throughout a long season, you may find yourself in games where you\u2019re trailing badly. One extra run won\u2019t bring you to level ground. Instead, you got to go yard with runners on base. That\u2019s basically the principle with Nasdaq stocks to buy on the dip: high risk for potentially high reward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nViper Energy (VNOM) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictions\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Midland, Texas, Viper Energy (NASDAQ:VNOM) falls under the oil and gas midstream component of the hydrocarbon value chain. This segment focuses on the transportation and storage needs of energy commodities. Basically, it acts as the link between upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing). As such, Viper plays a critical role in the broader infrastructural framework.\n\nSince the start of the year, VNOM stock has jumped to an almost 21% lead. However, it has slipped conspicuously since peaking in April. Nevertheless, the red ink could be temporary, making Viper a candidate for Nasdaq stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nIn particular, the company\u2019s financial performance alone warrants special attention. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, Viper\u2019s average earnings per share hit 69 cents. This translated to an average earnings beat of 41.45%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts do anticipate a dip in EPS of 10% to $2.49. However, sales could rise 5.7% to reach $874.95 million. Also, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the company offers a forward dividend yield of 5.78%.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Beijing, China, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) represents one of the flagship e-commerce firms in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Of course, that used to be an enviable label. Nowadays, many critics have called into question the viability of the Chinese economy post-Covid-19. Still, buying JD stock into weakness could be an attractive speculative play, especially if the underlying arena bounces back.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the start of the year, JD.com shares have only gained a little more than 4%. Over the past 52 weeks, they\u2019re down nearly 19%. Plus, the equity has been weak in the trailing month, down more than 6% below parity. Still, that could be a tempting dip-buying prospect as the company\u2019s financials are surprisingly robust.\n\nDuring the past four quarters, JD.com\u2019s average EPS hit 80 cents. This translated to an earnings beat of 17.35%. During the trailing 12 months (TTM), the enterprise posted net income of $3.38 billion or $2.21 per share.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate a nearly 6% rise in EPS to $3.29. Also, the top line may expand by 5.2% to reach $160.3 billion.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nCalling Bolingbrook, Illinois home, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) falls under the broad consumer cyclical sector, specifically the specialty retail space. Ulta is one of the powerhouses in the beauty care area, with its stores featuring a plethora of beauty products, including cosmetics, fragrance, hair and skin care and other solutions. It also features in-store salons.\n\nFundamentally, Ulta should benefit from the residual effects of travel prioritization. When Covid-19 restrictions first faded away, people took to the friendly skies under the revenge travel phenomenon. While this acute narrative has diminished, consumers following the global crisis are earmarking their discretionary funds for vacations. That should help Ulta Beauty. After all, you want to look good while you\u2019re having your fun in the sun.\n\nTo be sure, ULTA stock hasn\u2019t performed that well, down almost 20% year-to-date. It\u2019s also down 16% in the past 52 weeks. Still, that makes the retail specialist a possible candidate for Nasdaq stocks to buy on the dip. Financially, it has been consistent, posting an earnings surprise of 4.08% in the past four quarters.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate 3.2% growth in the top line to $11.56 billion. In the following year, sales could rise 6% to $12.26 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With the equities space continuing to enjoy its blistering recovery from the doldrums of the Covid-19 crisis, fewer and fewer ideas exist that are considered genuine discounts. Nowadays, several of the desirable market ideas just seem overpriced. However, if you look around, there are still some promising enterprises that make up the ranks of oversold stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nThe ideas that comprise this category attract eyeballs for one main reason: humans love their discounts. Even those who are financially well off typically can\u2019t resist the allure of getting more for their money. It\u2019s like shopping in the grocery store and coming across a two-for-one deal of products you already buy anyways.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you take the discount? It\u2019s essentially a gift. That\u2019s roughly the same principle here.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, red-stained securities are always liable for even more losses. However, some downtrodden names seem ready for a rebound, particularly because of their relevant businesses. With that in mind, below are oversold stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) makes a great case for oversold stocks to buy on the dip thanks to its underlying innovations. To be sure, it\u2019s understandable why the market doesn\u2019t care for BIDU stock. Since the start of the year, shares have plunged more than 23%. The Chinese economy seems suspect, leading to an exit out of the arena. However, the company is also one of the world\u2019s top internet technology firms.\n\nWhat should really attract contrarians is that the company has invested heavily into artificial intelligence and large language models. Still, few want to give the time of day to BIDU, which suits speculators just fine. Right now, shares trade at 1.69X trailing-year revenue. That\u2019s below the 2X multiple that was seen just in the first quarter. And it\u2019s significantly below the 2.95X posted in Q1 2023.\n\nFurther, in the past four quarters, Baidu\u2019s average earnings per share reached $2.94. In terms of earnings surprise, this performance translated to 26.23%. That\u2019s impressive. For fiscal 2024, analysts are anticipate a slight dip in EPS to $11.21. On the top line, it sees modest growth of 2% to reach $19.34 billion.\n\nStill, with the way the company has been performing, Baidu can surprise.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nI know that the consumer economy is struggling under the weight of inflation and high borrowing costs. Therefore, demand for many enterprises under the discretionary category faces significant pressure. However, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) arguably deserves a rethink. As a beauty care specialist, it aligns with the experiential focus that has driven travel-sector-related demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nFundamentally, the forced quarantines that occurred during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis sparked pent-up demand for vacations and other social events and gatherings. So, I anticipate that Ulta Beauty would benefit a bit more from the retail revenge phenomenon. After all, it was the social mobility aspect that was denied during Covid.\n\nUnfortunately, the market doesn\u2019t quite see it that way. Since the year\u2019s start, ULTA stock dipped more than 21%. Fine \u2013 but let\u2019s also consider that in the past four quarters, the company\u2019s EPS averaged $6.41. This translated to an earnings surprise of 4.08%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts see 3.2% sales growth to $11.56 billion. In the following year, revenue may rise by 6% to hit $12.26 billion. Given the aforementioned fundamentals, ULTA ranks among the oversold stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nKosmos Energy (KOS) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictions\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpecializing in the upstream oil segment of the hydrocarbon value chain, Kosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) has struggled for traction this year. Since the beginning of January, KOS stock fell almost 22%. That\u2019s ugly and there\u2019s more going on than just a broader focus on clean and renewable energy sources. Instead, geopolitics may be playing a huge role in the undervaluation of KOS.\n\nEssentially, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine could be having a detrimental impact on the part of the aggressor. Ukrainian forces have been attacking Russia\u2019s oil refineries (downstream) in a bid to slow its invasion. As a result, Moscow is losing a key revenue stream. It\u2019s got to make up for that loss by selling huge volumes of crude oil (upstream). Naturally, this dynamic has an impact on upstream specialists.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: this geopolitical crisis can pivot in any number of ways. Further, the cooled tensions in the Middle East could easily reignite. That would surely boost demand for upstream companies.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe Kosmos\u2019 sales could hit $2.01 billion. If so, that would imply almost 50% growth. That seems quite reasonable given the circumstances. Thus, KOS is one of the oversold stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Retail Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Retail sales are moving at a sluggish pace but several trends suggest that strong buy retail stocks will yield high returns in the long-haul.\n\nIn a year marked by inflationary concerns, high unemployment and fed rate cuts, the retail industry is experiencing a major slowdown. Retail sales in May grew slightly at 0.1% versus last month and 2.3% over last year. This came in below the anticipated 0.3% increase this month.\n\nHowever, the long term prospects for the industry remain positive. Spurred by rapid economic growth and tech innovations the Bureau of Economic Analysis expects retail sales in 2024 to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%. Furthermore, the integration of AI, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) solutions in digital platforms is set to enhance the shopping experience.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite the current challenges, analysts remain bullish on several companies in the space, rating them as strong buys. These stocks show promise of significant long-term upside, making it the perfect time to get in while prices remain favorable.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) has been on a winning streak for the last few years. Fueled by the expansion of its store footprint, loyalty programs and Gen Z splurging more on beauty products, the company has managed to stay on top of analysts\u2019 buy lists, despite a recent slowdown in sales.\n\nIn its recent earnings report, the company reported a 1.6% increase in comparable sales versus the prior quarter. While this was an improvement, it was still a considerable decline from the same period last year. The dip is a result of declining demand in its prestige beauty category where Ulta struggles to gain market share. Nevertheless, shares of the company gained 11% following its CEO\u2019s optimistic strategy to boost sales in the second half of the year.\n\nAs a historically strong performer in the retail sector, Ulta\u2019s low price is an opportune time to invest in the stock. The company has a highly differentiated business model, catering to a wide customer base with brands across different price segments.\n\nIn addition to a strong product portfolio, Ulta also generates revenue from its in-store services and rewards customers through its loyalty program. This will serve as catalysts for the company growth when the markets recover.\n\nAnalysts at Loop Capital and TD Cowen seem to agree, giving the stock a buy rating and price upside in the $500 to $520 range. ULTA is currently among the top strong buy retail stocks based on 27 analyst ratings.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s been a slow couple of years for Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) but several trends point to a strong recovery on the horizon. The e-commerce giant\u2019s financial performance was clouded by fierce industry competition and macroeconomic concerns that ate into its market share. BABA stock has been trending lower and is down considerably from its pandemic-induced highs in 2020.\n\nWhile the stock charts don\u2019t paint a pretty picture, analysts predict a major upside potential for the company. One reason for this optimistic outlook can be attributed to its recent earnings report. Alibaba reported a 4% increase in its e-commerce business, a 2% rise over the previous quarter. Looking ahead the company anticipates higher growth rates that will be fueled by its cloud and AI businesses. These initiatives will potentially drive double digit revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nWhile the immediate future still remains a challenge, analysts continue to remain bullish on the stock\u2019s performance. Loop Capital gave BABA stock a buy rating and a 45% price upside. Citigroup maintains a similar rating, predicting a 53% price increase. Analysts\u2019 sentiments towards Alibaba makes this the perfect time to get in on this strong buy retail stocks.\n\nLovesac (LOVE) Lovesac store sign at Florida Mall in Orlando, Florida, USA. Lovesac is an American furniture retailer, specializing in a patented modular furniture system. LOVE stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile furniture stocks don\u2019t warrant the most enthusiastic responses from investors, Lovesac (NASDAQ:LOVE) is a name that stands out from the crowd. The small-cap growth stock is perhaps well known for its \u201csanctionals\u201d which are small modular couches that can be rearranged in endless ways to fit your space. This unique piece of furniture has served a huge catalyst for its growth, accounting for 90% of total net sales.\n\nIn addition to its eco-friendly furniture, Lovesac\u2019s growth is also driven by its omni channel sales platforms. The company has a digital presence, 147 pop-ups in Costco (NASDAQ:COST), locations in 41 Best-Buy (NYSE:BBY) and partnerships with several retailers. This helps the company enhance brand visibility while keeping operating costs minimal.\n\nIn its recent earnings report, Lovesac shares gained on a narrower than expected net loss amidst a challenging market environment. Revenue came in at $132 million, surpassing expectations of $128 million. Full year guidance set between $700 million to $770 million.\n\nKeeping with this optimistic outlook, analysts remain bullish on LOVE stock as the market continues to recover in the latter part of the year. Roth/MKM maintains its buy rating on the stock with a price target of $30. Lovesac is also rated among the top strong buy retail stocks based on six analyst ratings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Beaten-Down Growth Stocks to Buy Without Hesitation in the 2024 Bull Market",
        "content": "The stock market has had a roaring first half of 2024, but not all companies have seen shares respond in the same way. As always, it's important to look beyond share prices and see how the business of any stock you want to invest in is holding up.\n\nSometimes, a beaten-down stock is a fantastic opportunity to become part owner of a business on the dip. Here are two such companies to keep in mind if you have cash on hand to invest that you don't need for bills or other near-term financial obligations, provided you have a buy-and-hold period of at least three to five years.\n\nLet's take a closer look.\n\n1. Pfizer\n\nPfizer(NYSE: PFE) is trading down by roughly 30% over the past year. The primary culprit here has been a steep deceleration in growth, sales, and profits following the heightened run up it experienced with the success of its COVID-19 vaccine and oral antiviral drug. All businesses go through cycles, and this is no less true of companies in the pharmaceutical industry. Even a healthcare giant like Pfizer is not impervious to the changing tides. That said, a COVID-19 sales cliff was inevitable.\n\nPfizer has ensured that the billions in revenue, profits, and cash that its COVID-19 products brought in were put to excellent use. The company executed a flurry of acquisitive maneuvers.\n\nOne notable mention was cancer biotech company Seagen, which specializes in developing antibody-drug conjugates -- special proteins made in a lab that seek to find and destroy cancer. The Seagen acquisition, which cost the company $43 billion, doubled Pfizer's drug pipeline and added nine cancer drugs that are already blockbusters or on the way to achieving that status.\n\nIts $6.7 billion acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals brought experimental anti-inflammation drug Etrasimod (for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis) into the fold, along with other novel candidates across gastroenterology, dermatology, and cardiology. Another acquisition of note was Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, a move that cost the company $11.6 billion and brought migraine medicine Nurtec into its portfolio.\n\nPfizer also used its COVID-19 funds to fuel aggressive research and development efforts. In 2023, the company garnered more drug approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration than any other pharmaceutical company -- seven in total. It's on the tail end of an 18-month period in which it is planned to launch 19 new products or indications. It also expects to achieve an additional $25 billion in annual revenue by 2030 thanks to its aggressive R&D efforts and acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis would help offset the expected $18 billion or so revenue loss between 2025 and 2030 that management previously targeted due to the loss of patent exclusivity on some key products. Pfizer is also planning to have eight oncology blockbuster products in its portfolio by 2030. While oncology has remained a key area of focus for Pfizer through the years, its acquisition of Seagen signals a new and improved footprint within this space that could pay off significantly for the business in the years ahead.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Pfizer reported profits of $3.1 billion on revenue of about $15 billion. That revenue figure was down 19% year over year, but if you leave out its COVID-19 products, revenue actually rose 11% from one year ago. Management also expects that its ongoing cost-cutting efforts will save the business $4 billion this year.\n\nOn another positive note, the decline in stock price has significantly improved Pfizer's dividend yield. That yield is approximately 6% at the time of this writing, with a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. Pfizer's dividend payout has also risen by about 17% over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nWhile it will take time for the fruits of Pfizer's recent product launches, cost-cutting efforts, and acquisitions to take root in its balance sheet, this is a company that looks to be on the right path to a brighter future after a bumpy period of transition.\n\nPfizer has 175 years in business under its belt and a promising road to growth ahead, so investors wanting to become part owner in an established healthcare business and enjoy some dividend income to boot might want to take a second look.\n\n2. Ulta Beauty\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) is trading down by about 15% from one year ago and 22% from the start of 2024. This is despite its continued resilience in a challenging spending environment.\n\nUlta Beauty is the largest specialty beauty retailer in the country. It's known for its brick-and-mortar stores, where shoppers can access thousands of beauty products across a variety of categories. These stores include Ulta's own stand-alone locations as well as those found in its long-standing partner Target's stores.\n\nThe company also has a thriving online presence where shoppers can access its products with ease. Ulta Beauty has 1,395 stores open, with a focus on high-traffic consumer locations. Its stores don't just feature aisles of products; most stores also offer beauty services, including a hair salon. It also has over 500 of its shops installed in various Target locations. \u200b\n\nThe secret sauce to Ulta's success goes beyond its diverse in-store and online presence. Its loyalty program keeps customers coming back for more, and those loyal members account for the lion's share of its total sales. The Ulta Beauty Rewards program allows members to earn points for each dollar they spend on products and beauty services.\n\nMembers can also earn points using certain credit cards or through purchases at Target Ulta Beauty locations. In 2023, more than 95% of Ulta Beauty's total sales came from members.\n\nThe loyalty of Ulta Beauty's shoppers, varying price points across key beauty categories, and the popularity of its in-store and online services have driven exceptional profits, revenue, and cash flows. Over the trailing-five-year period, Ulta Beauty has grown its annual revenue by approximately 52%. Its annual net income and operating cash flow have grown by respective amounts of 83% and 34% in that same time frame.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Ulta Beauty's sales totaled $2.7 billion, a 3.5% increase from the same period last year. Its gross profit was $1.07 billion, or approximately 40% of sales. Net income for the three-month period was down from one year ago, but still totaled $313 million.\n\nAt the end of the quarter, Ulta Beauty had around $525 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet and zero long-term debt. That's a notable feat for a capital-intensive business. The company trades at a price-to-sales ratio of about 1.6 at the time of this writing. It may be a good time for forward-thinking investors to consider a position in this top cosmetic stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pfizer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this beauty products retailer have returned +1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, which Ulta falls in, has lost 0.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $5.52 per share, indicating a change of -8.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.77 points to a change of -1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.61 indicates a change of +11% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ulta is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Ulta, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.62 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.56 billion and $12.25 billion estimates indicate +3.1% and +6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nUlta reported revenues of $2.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $6.47 for the same period compares with $6.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.37%. The EPS surprise was +4.52%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nUlta is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently published a list Analyst Recommends 10 Best Stocks to Diversify Your Portfolio Away from Mega-Cap Tech and AI Stocks. Since Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) ranks 9th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nVenu Krishna, Head of U.S. Equity Strategy & Global Equity Linked Strategies at Barclays, recently shared a basket of stocks he recommends offsetting the risks that come from market concentration in big tech stocks. In an interview with CNBC, Krishna emphasized that he remains inclined towards big tech stocks, but the important question he addressed is which stocks offer more value outside of the tech sector in the long term.\n\nKrishna\u2019s methodology to find some of the best stocks outside of the tech sector is simple: find out at what \u201ccore fundamental\u201d metrics big tech stocks are \u201cexcelling\u201d at and then \u201ctry to come close to that and create a portfolio which can give us that kind of exposure.\u201d Through this methodology, Krishna says, he came up with a well-diversified portfolio of stocks that could act as a \u201chedge\u201d against market concertation in big tech.\n\nKrishna said he applied \u201cliquidity filters\u201d on the whole market to remove a \u201cbunch of companies\u201d and narrow down to stocks with strong growth and FCF multiples.\n\nDespite him pointing out the concentration of gains problem, Venu Krishna believes the rise of big tech stocks is a \u201chealthy trend\u201d and some of the gains are now bifurcating to other sectors, too.\n\nHowever Krishna said that over the past 18 months his portfolio of stocks has lagged behind the Big Tech, but outperformed equal-weighted S&P 500 and market cap-weighted S&P 500.\n\nFor this article, we took a look at Krishna\u2019s latest basket of stocks to offset concentration in big tech risks and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA photograph of a customer testing out different products in the skincare aisle at a store.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 52\n\nBarclays in a latest report pitched Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA)\u00a0as a stock to diversify your portfolios in a concentrated market.

Ulta bulls believe Ulta Beauty Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:ULTA)\u00a0loyalty program and its products offered for a variety of budget ranges give it an edge over competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the latest earnings call Ulta Beauty Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:ULTA)\u00a0management talked about its loyalty program and memberships growth:\n\n\u201cOur world class loyalty program expanded again this quarter with the retention of our most valuable members remains very strong.

Given analysts expect Ulta Beauty Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:ULTA)\u00a0earnings to grow 9.90% next year, Ulta\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 15 makes the stock attractively valued.\n\nOverall, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) ranks 9th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Recommends 10 Best Stocks to Diversify Your Portfolio Away from Mega-Cap Tech and AI Stocks.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Ulta Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Investing isn't always rational. It seems logical that you'd want to buy a stock that's climbing. That implies it's doing well and that there's reason to be confident in its future potential. Sometimes, this is the way to go.\n\nBut if a stock is already demonstrating high gains, that could indicate it's reached a peak. Conversely, stocks that are tanking could be the key to investing success with a rebound. It could be a risky strategy unless there are valid reasons to believe it could stage a strong comeback.\n\nWhen a stock with every reason to outperform is tanking, that's an opportunity. Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) is a fantastic stock that typically beats the market and has incredible future potential, but it's down 19% this year. Here are three reasons to buy it hand over fist right now.\n\n1. The differentiated model\n\nUlta has built itself into a powerhouse cosmetics business by breaking all of the rules. It brings together luxury and mass brands, whereas the traditional setup divided those two segments into completely different markets. Ulta's management recognized that the core \"beauty\" enthusiast shops from both of these segments, and that offering them altogether under one roof was an untapped opportunity. It says that 66% of buyers are these enthusiasts, and they account for 83% of total sales.\n\nAnother way it stands out is that it offers services. Other brands all operate similar models: Luxury brands are carried in department stores, and mass brands are sold in pharmacies and supermarkets. Many brands have direct-to-consumer physical stores, a recent development in the world of cosmetics, and today most brands also have digital direct-to-consumer channels. None of these setups are conducive to offering services the way Ulta's large stores are, and services are a key element of its model. People who come in for services, like hair or nail design, are much more likely to also walk out with products. It's a flywheel effect that leads to greater loyalty and higher sales.\n\nToday, Ulta carries hundreds of brands across demographics, in addition to its own brands, to tap into this customer, and loyal beauty spenders are its main market. Ulta has 1,375 stores across the country, and it's has launched a successful rollout of stores-within-stores at select Target locations.\n\nIt had 43 million members at the end of 2023, an increase of 3 million over 2022, and these members account for an incredible 95% of sales. That provides Ulta with tremendous data to use in creation of its agenda and the ability to understand and meet demand.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Don't mistake its profitability\n\nOne of the factors that have led to Ulta stock's decline is a pressured operating margin. Ulta is feeling inflationary pressure in a number of ways; sales crept up 3.5% up from $2.6 billion last year to $2.7 billion this year in the 2024 fiscal first quarter, ended May 4, with a 1.6% increase in comparable sales. Earnings per share (EPS) fell from $6.88 last year to $6.47 this year, and operating margin dropped from 16.8% to 14.7%. Management lowered its outlook across the board.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that Ulta carries zero debt and generates steady free cash flow. These are positive qualities that mean it's in no financial danger and is operating efficiently. The drop in profitability is an outcome of external factors, and the company is rolling through a challenging time.\n\nAll companies will face challenges at different points in time. Investors shouldn't panic sell because of a difficult quarter--or even several. If the investing thesis is intact, and management is effectively dealing with short-term hiccups, hanging on will reward you in the end.\n\nFor new investors, the challenges can create a buying opportunity. Read on.\n\n3. The dirt cheap price\n\nAt the current price, Ulta trades at a dirt cheap forward 1-year price-to-earnings multiple of under 14. That's a bargain when put into the context of Ulta's potential.\n\nThis is the principle behind value investing. Value investors look for stocks that could be undervalued and will likely rise to meet their real value.\n\nUlta is a well-run company with a long-term competitive advantage in its differentiated model that targets the beauty enthusiast. It's trading at a discount, and now is an excellent time to buy shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ulta Beauty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ulta Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "It is not unusual for stocks to do better than analysts predict. There are several reasons why this could happen, but it usually means that investors have the opportunity to profit from the market by betting on them. There is a group of investors whose entire strategy is this: to bet on stocks that Wall Street Analysts have written off.\n\nThis year, the best-overwritten stocks cover some of the world\u2019s most promising industries, from gaming to cosmetics and e-commerce. Their performance has exceeded all expectations, and from all indications, they are the best stocks to buy going into the second half of the year.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll cover these stocks in-depth, discussing how they\u2019ve performed so well in the market and what makes them valuable portfolio additions for investors looking for the best stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is a popular online game platform where users can create or play games made by others. It is one of the pioneers of the online video-gaming era and has received massive success.\n\nThe company has experienced turbulence this year, producing underwhelming numbers in the ongoing fiscal quarter. It fell significantly below its $870 \u2013 $900 million estimate and had to lower its full-year guidance. It also fell by 27%, causing concern among investors who worry about how it might fare in an economic recession.\n\nDespite these adversities, Roblox is showing great perseverance in the market, and if its recent history is anything to go by, it would be unwise to count it out. According to its most recent quarterly report, its top line is up by 22%, a significant improvement from previous quarters.\n\nFurthermore, the company is involved in a series of partnerships that could boost its value in the year\u2019s second half. Nike, Walmart and Fenty are some companies that utilize Roblox\u2019s in-game advertising experience to engage consumers and increase product sales. From all indications, there is a lot to look forward to from the company.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an American beauty and cosmetics giant with a chain of cosmetic stores scattered across the country. Its stores house some of the most popular cosmetic brands in the world, from Fenty to Chanel and Cerave.\n\nEven though beauty and cosmetics retailers are experiencing a tough time due to the emergence of online beauty stores and the subsequent eradication of retailers and other middlemen, Ulta Beauty remains unphased. If anything, they may have benefitted from this industry shift. Much of this is due to its strong offline and online presence, the wide variety of brands it sells and its many stores (around 1,400 in the US).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe combining all these factors contributes to the company\u2019s impressive performance this year. Furthermore, its share price is an absolute bargain and an ideal option for investors looking for stocks to buy as the second half of the year begins. Its current share price is around $25 and $26.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce giant specializing in everything from clothing and jewelry to electronics and accessories. Whatever you are looking for, the odds are that you will find it on Alibaba.\n\nMore impressively, the company is a parent to smaller e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and Tmall, and has a strong hold on the Chinese market. You might wonder why Wall Street Analysts did not have high hopes for it this year. The last few years have been rough for the company, partly because of the heavy-handed pandemic lockdowns in China that lasted from 2020 through late 2022.\n\nDespite this, Alibaba has exhibited tremendous resilience and is now rebounding in the market. According to its latest quarterly report, it is up 45% in foreign commerce revenue. It will likely continue to put up impressive numbers for the remainder of the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Ulta Beauty Stock (NASDAQ:ULTA): The More It Drops, The More I Buy",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty stock (NASDAQ:ULTA)\u00a0has dipped by about 20% year-to-date. Yet, the more it falls, the more I am inclined to buy. As the leading specialty beauty retailer in the U.S., Ulta Beauty continues to deliver strong results. Although its sales growth has decelerated recently, scaring investors, Ulta remains highly profitable. Further, the company returns capital to shareholders aggressively. Along with shares trading at an attractive valuation, Ulta appears to have substantial upside potential. Thus, I am bullish on the stock.\n\nQ1 Results: The Market Is Missing the Point\n\nSeeing how the market reacted to Ulta\u2019s Q1 results, it seems that investors are missing the point about what makes the company an attractive investment at the present moment. Investors seem to worry about a noticeable slowdown in Ulta\u2019s revenue growth, which explains why the stock remains near its 52-week lows post-earnings. Although this concern is not unfounded, it misses the core reasons why Ulta\u2019s bullish case is compelling today \u2014 its exceptional profitability and attractive valuation.\n\nIs Ulta\u2019s Revenue Growth Slowdown Too Worrisome?\n\nBefore we examine Ulta\u2019s profitability and current valuation, let\u2019s examine its revenue growth and check whether the ongoing slowdown is too worrisome. Long story short, I don\u2019t find it concerning, as I briefly mentioned in the introduction. Admittedly, the 3.5% growth in net sales during Q1 indicates a notable deceleration, marking the weakest top-line performance in quite some time\u2014it is the poorest revenue growth over the past 13 quarters, to be precise. However, it\u2019s crucial to consider this within context.\n\nSpecifically, I believe that Ulta\u2019s most recent revenue figure marks a normalization following a series of remarkable growth over several quarters previously. The first-quarter results faced tough comps from last year (Q1 2023), when net sales grew by a notable 12.3%. Furthermore, going back another year (Q1 2022), we saw an even more remarkable upsurge of 65.2% in net sales.\n\nTherefore, it makes more sense to focus on Ulta\u2019s sustained ability not only to uphold these heightened sales levels but also to grow beyond them rather than translate its recent sales figures as a notable deceleration.\n\nUlta Remains Highly Profitable\n\nSales aside, Ulta remains highly profitable, which marks the core point of my bullish case. Note that the company\u2019s operating margin declined from 16.8% to 14.7% in the first quarter. This was mainly due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink, which compressed its gross margin and higher SG&A expenses. Still, since Ulta has a clean balance sheet with not a single dollar of long-term debt, the bulk of its operating income ended up in the bottom line, with its net income margin coming in at 11.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith comparable store sales on the rise and ongoing store openings, Ulta\u2019s margins are likely to rebound, especially with easier comps on the horizon. Specifically, in Q1, same-store sales rose 1.6% compared to last year, driven by a 1.3% growth in transactions and a 0.3% gain in the average ticket. Also, the company opened 12 new stores during the quarter, closed just two, and relocated one, ending the period with a record number of locations (1,395). This trend should allow Ulta to achieve economies of scale over time.\n\nIn fact, Wall Street anticipates a return to earnings growth in the second half of the year, which should offset any challenges faced during the first half. Consequently, earnings per share (EPS) for FY2024 are projected to remain stable year-over-year. Thus, Ulta will remain highly profitable this year despite the stock\u2019s performance suggesting otherwise.\n\nValuation and Capital Returns Signal Buying Opportunity\n\nWith Ulta\u2019s profitability remaining strong and its share price having fallen substantially lately, the stock\u2019s valuation has been compressed to very attractive levels. Combined with Ulta\u2019s aggressive capital returns, the stock seems to present a compelling buying opportunity.\n\nIn particular, even with earnings expected to remain flat this year, Ulta is trading at a forward P/E of just under 15 at its current levels. This is one of the most humble multiples the stock has ever traded at. In the meantime, the company has repurchased over $1 billion worth of stock over the past four quarters.\n\nThis translates to 5.5% of its outstanding shares at its current market cap\u2014a very attractive buyback yield. Once more meaningful growth resumes, today\u2019s repurchases should prove to have been highly accretive to EPS, further fueling a bullish sentiment, in my view.\n\nIs ULTA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nRegarding Wall Street\u2019s view on the stock, Ulta Beauty features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $488.76, the average\u00a0ULTA stock price prediction suggests 25.3% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell ULTA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Christopher Horvers\u00a0from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), with an average return of 17.26% per rating and a 69% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTo conclude, I believe that despite recent concerns about Ulta\u2019s revenue growth slowdown, viewing the stock\u2019s investment potential from the right perspective reveals a more promising story. The company keeps growing against tough comps while its profitability remains very strong. Further, management\u2019s aggressive capital returns underscore the current undervaluation. The ongoing buybacks will likely prove to be highly accretive to EPS in the coming years. Thus, I will be a buyer, even if shares continue to decline.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) has been a disappointment for shareholders over the past three months. Its share price dropped from $567 in the middle of March to $376 in the middle of May, then rebounded to $395 at the time of writing. The three-month return was -27.70%.\n\nHowever, looking from a broader timeline, Ulta Beauty has delivered nice gains for shareholders. Over the past 16 years, its share price has managed to grow by more than 2,800%, with a compounded annual gain of 23%. Let's take a closer look to determine whether Ulta Beauty is a good stock for long-term investors now.\n\nSteady growth in a challenging business environment\n\nFor the first quarter, Ulta Beauty reported steady growth in a tough market environment, with net sales up 3.50% to $2.72 billion and comparable sales up 1.60%. The company outperformed the Wall Street's forecasts of $2.72 billion. It also recored strong earnings of $6.47 per share versus estimates of $6.25. The operating profit margin reached 14.70% of sales. Notably, fragrance and skincare saw double-digit and mid-digit growth and makeup sales declined in the mid-single-digit range.\n\nThe current industry environment and increased competition led Ulta Beauty to revise its full-year forecast. The company currently expects fiscal 2024 net sales of $11.50 billion to $11.60 billion, down from $11.70 billion to $11.80 billion previously. The comp sales growth would stay in the range of 2% to 3%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $25.20 and $26, versus $26.20 to $27 from earlier projections. These adjustments reflect anticipated continued pressures in the beauty category in addition to increased competition from rivals like Sephora and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) push into high-quality beauty brands.\n\nCEO Dave Kimbell attributed the forecast adjustment to the dynamics in the first quarter and cited several strategic initiatives designed to solidify Ulta Beauty's market position. He said:\n\nWe are confident in our model and our ability to gain share and drive significant sustainable value over the long-term. The actions we have taken and investments we have made over the past few years have fortified our operating foundation and we are a stronger, more profitable company today than we were just a few years ago.\n\nUlta Beauty is implementing several key initiatives, including enhancing product range and digital experience, accelerating social relevance, leveraging the loyalty program and evolving promotional strategies. The company is also working to maintain its gross margin, which dropped to 39.20% in the first quarter due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink. It is launching new marketing technology later this year that will allow for more personalization and top-line growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlans to continue repurchasing shares\n\nUlta Beauty has a history of repurchasing shares on the open market, reducing its share count over the years. The company has spent over $5.86 billion on stock buybacks since 2013. As a result, total shares outstanding dropped by over 23% from 64.46 million in 2013 to 49.6 million in 2023. As of the first quarter, the share count stood at around 48.38 million. Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential\n\nFurther, the company plans to repurchase $1 billion worth of stock within the year. If $1 billion is used to buy back shares at around $400 per share, Ulta Beauty could buy back up to 2.50 million additional shares, yielding more than 5.20% for its shareholders.\n\nDebt-free balance sheet\n\nWhat I like about Ulta Beauty is the debt-free balance sheet. As of May 2024, it had $2.30 billion in total stockholders' equity. The cash on hand came in at nearly $525 million. While the company has no interest-bearing debt, it does have operating lease liabilities. The total operating lease liabilities, both short and long term, were $1.89 billion. Although the total amount of operating leases seems to be a lot, the lease payment spread out over many years. The lease payment which the company has to pay within one year are only around $351,500. The total lease payments in the next three to five years amount to nearly $545,900. Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential\n\nSource: Ulta Beauty's 10-K filing\n\nAs its operating cash flow has stayed in the range of $810.3 million to $1.48 billion in the past five years, Ulta Beauty could settle operating lease payment quite easily.\n\nPotential upside\n\nUlta Beauty has expanded its free cash flow from $101 million in 2013 to $1.04 billion in 2023, posting compounded annual growth of 26.20%. Since the company has been generating growing free cash flow quite consistently over the past decade, we can use discounted free cash flow method to value the business.\n\nAssuming the retailer's free cash flow growth would reduce a bit to 20% per year in the next 10 years, then the terminal growth would be 2% afterwards. With a 10% discount rate, the company's enterprise value would be around $46 billion. Adjusting the current net cash of $525 million, its market capitalization should be worth $45.56 billion. If Ulta Beauty commits all $1 billion in share repurchase within this year, the total share count would be reduced to 45.88 million. This translates to an intrinsic value per share of $993, nearly 150% upside from the current trading price. Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential\n\nSource: Author's calculation\n\nKey takeaway\n\nUlta Beauty remains a resilient long-term investment despite recent volatility and a downward adjustment of its fiscal outlook. Its strategic initiatives, a robust share repurchase program and debt-free balance sheet underscore its sound fundamentals and focus on shareholder value. Our recent DCF valuation shows the stock is quite cheap with a potential 150% upside for investors. Therefore, Ulta Beauty fits well in portfolios of long-term investors who are looking for a growth stock with a solid financial foundation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will talk about the Best Everyday Office Perfume for Men. For our detailed discussion, go directly to the 15 Best Everyday Office Perfume for Men.\n\nRising Demand for Luxury Fragrances: Amouage Reports Stellar Growth:\n\nAs previously mentioned in our article \"15 Best Everyday Colognes in 2024,\" the global perfume market was valued at $50.85 billion in 2022 and is expected to climb at a CAGR of 5.9% between 2023 and 2030 as there is a higher emphasis on personal grooming, which is being driven by an increase in demand for luxury and exotic fragrances.\n\nA prime example of the rising demand for luxury fragrances is Amouage, an Omani luxury perfume company. Over the last three years, Amouage's annual retail sales have reportedly almost doubled, reaching $210 million in 2023.\n\nThe Oman-based high-end fragrance house from Oman recently declared a +24% YoY growth in revenue in 2023. Retail sales in European markets surged by more than 39%, driven by outstanding performance at major department stores. Amouage declared a 28% rise in the Asia-Pacific area and more than 21% growth in America. Oman and the United Arab Emirates were the two most notable nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), with like-for-like sales growth rates of 33% and over 30%, respectively.\n\nWith the introduction of new independent mono-brand luxury retail experiences in major countries such as China, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Travel Retail, Malaysia, and Oman, Amouage boutiques ultimately experienced 27% growth in 2023.\n\nAmouage's highest-performing markets have been Oman, the UAE, the United States, and China, which collectively account for more than 40% of total revenue.\n\nIf we look at the bigger picture, we can see that the global market for luxury fragrances was estimated to be worth $12.6 billion in 2023, as we noted in our article, \u201c20 Most Luxurious Feminine Perfumes in the World.\u201d\n\nLeaders in the Fragrance Market: Est\u00e9e Lauder and Ulta Beauty's Investment Trends and Performance in 2024:\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), a well-known American international beauty company, has remained one of the market leaders for perfumes, owning popular brands such as Jo Malone London, TOM FORD, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Le Labo, and Clinique. Additionally, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is one of the top \u201c15 Beauty Stocks To Invest In\u201d.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) disclosed net sales for its fragrance segment at $575 million, a marginal dip from the same quarter in the previous year, where the fragrance net sales were $577 million\u200b.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company reveals that Est\u00e9e Lauder's fragrance net sales dropped mostly due to weaker retail sales throughout the holidays and crucial shopping periods, ultimately reducing shipments for replenishment orders compared to the previous year.\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder's stock has also dropped over 16% so far this year, and in the past year, the stock has fallen more than 36% as of the close of May 29.\n\nBefore COVID-19, the stock was trading at $200. By the end of 2021, it soared to $370 on average, but since then, it has lost more than two-thirds of its value. The trailing PE ratio is 69, while the forward PE ratio is 30. Furthermore, diluted EPS fell from $6.55 in 2022 to $2.79 in 2023, then to $1.78 over the last year.\n\nAccording to Est\u00e9e Lauder, the company's stock fell due to persistent macroeconomic challenges, such as the worldwide geopolitical unrest in some regions and the continued softness of prestige beauty in mainland China. As a result, the Company is reducing its organic net sales outlook range while raising and narrowing its adjusted diluted earnings per common share range, partially offset by an expected negative effect from foreign currency translation.\n\nAfter reaching its high at the end of 2021 or the start of 2022, the company's revenue has also been steadily declining. Revenue dropped from $17.74 billion in 2022 to $15.91 billion in 2023, further decreasing to $15.35 billion during the last 12 months.\n\nDue to inflation and its power to raise prices, Estee Lauder was able to raise prices throughout the pandemic. Its share price therefore doubled. The company's stock price lost two-thirds of its worth in the previous few years due to consumers' reluctance to pay such high prices. The fundamental concern for Estee Lauder is when it will be able to return to sales growth, and boosting pricing does not help.\n\nDespite this, after a period of sluggish sales due to inflation, the business outperformed expectations, demonstrating a restored demand for beauty and cosmetic products across the United States. Sales in China and Asia's travel retail industry returned after a three-quarter recession, indicating buyers are again willing to shell out on luxuries such as makeup and perfumes. Estee Lauder's organic net sales climbed by 1% in the Americas and 3% in the Asia Pacific area during Q3 2024.\n\nOn the bright side, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies announced net sales of $3.94 billion for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024, a 5% increase over the $3.75 billion reported in the same quarter the previous year. In addition, organic sales increased by 6%.\n\nMoreover, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)' Q3 2024 results show a promising 1% increase in fragrance organic net sales. As per the company, net sales from its luxury brands climbed in the mid-single digits, indicating growth across all geographic regions, somewhat offset by a drop from Est\u00e9e Lauder.\n\nSpecifically, Jo Malone London net sales climbed by high single digits, fueled by robust double-digit growth in EMEA and the Americas, predominantly driven by blockbuster product franchises like English Pear and Wood Sage & Sea Salt, as well as new product innovations including Red Hibiscus.\n\nAnother Est\u00e9e Lauder-owned luxury fragrance brand, Le Labo's net sales jumped by double digits internationally and in Asia/Pacific, owing mainly to the sustained success of hero product franchises such as Santal 33 and Another 13, along with targeted expanded consumer reach worldwide.\n\nHedge fund positions in the company grew to 51 from 43 in Q1 2024 with a collective stake of $2.5 billion.\n\nL'Oreal, the company's competitor, has faced a noticeable slowdown in its sales growth rate over the past several years. Its growth rate from 2020 to 2021 was 13.34%. From 2021 to 2022, this increased to 18.51%, but from 2022 to 2023, it drastically decreased to 7.61% indicating an industrywide downturn, while Est\u00e9e Lauder's revenue fall suggests that there are also company-specific concerns.\n\nFinally, it is determined that the investors are prepared to pay a PE multiple of 30 for Est\u00e9e Lauder because they believe that the company is now underperforming and will return to a stock price of at least $200, where it was before the pandemic.\n\nThough it might be too soon to buy this stock, Est\u00e9e Lauder is likely undervalued at its current price. As an alternative, we think AI stocks will keep rising as they may be the most groundbreaking invention since the wheel and fire.\n\nAnother company, Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), which is the largest specialized beauty retailer in the United States as well as one of the \u201c20 Biggest Retail Companies in the US,\u201d offers sales of fragrances, cosmetics, skincare, hair care, and salon services. In addition to having 1,385 physical locations in all 50 states, Ulta Beauty now sells its products online and offers an array of social media content, tutorials, and tips.\n\nUlta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) recently announced that in Q1 2024, its fragrance category contributed around 10% of net sales. Comparing this to Q1 2023, the same quarter the previous year, the company\u2019s fragrance segment generated about 9% of net sales, indicating a 1% gain.\n\nOn the other hand, as of May 31's closing, Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA)\u2019s stock had decreased 5.92% in the year before and 20.76% so far this year. However, the price jumped by 1.20% during the last 5 days, giving it a bright prospect.\n\nPositive developments have emerged as elite money managers have poured investments into Ulta Beauty\u2019s stock, with hedge fund positions jumping from 49 to 52 in Q1 2024, resulting in a total stake of $1.4 billion.\n\nWith that said, here are the 15 Best Everyday Office Perfumes for Men.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks Wall Street Might Be Sleeping On, but I'm Not",
        "content": "Most of the time, Wall Street gets it right. That is to say, the market usually knows what's important to know about a company, and appropriately reflects this information in that stock's price. These values, of course, can and do change every day. However, these changes mostly reflect new information or new perceptions regarding a stock's risks.\n\nEvery now and then, though, Wall Street -- analysts and investors alike -- can miss the mark. More to the point, \"the Street\" doesn't fully see a company's potential and therefore undervalues that company's shares. This creates opportunities for astute investors that see the bigger picture.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three great growth stocks that Wall Street might be sleeping on, but I'm not.\n\n1. Roblox\n\nIt hasn't been an easy past few weeks for Roblox(NYSE: RBLX) shareholders. The stock tumbled early last month, mostly in response to disappointing guidance for the fiscal quarter now underway. Namely, the video gaming platform's expectation for second-quarter bookings of between $870 million and $900 million was below estimates; the company also lowered its full-year guidance. Thanks to that single day's sell-off, the stock is now down 27% from February's high. That's despite the slight rebound since the post-earnings pullback. Investors are worried about what looks like a slowdown stemming from economic weakness.\n\nHowever, this doubt misses a couple of important realities regarding Roblox.\n\nFirst, although the company's internal outlook wasn't quite up to external expectations, Roblox is still doing incredibly well. Last quarter's top line was up 22% year over year, beating analysts' consensus figure. It's still in the red as well, but last quarter's loss was also less than expected. Sure, revenue and bookings growth is anticipated to slow down for the remainder of this year and the next. Based on its recent past, however, it's arguable the company's near-term future will be brighter than currently believed.\n\nSecond, while its roots are in the online video-gaming arena, Roblox is branching out. Last month, it widened the test launch of its in-game advertising platform, which shows paid-for billboards within the virtual worlds its users visit. These ads can even directly generate a real-world sale of a good or service. At the same time, the company's tech can create virtual worlds for brands that want to offer an immersive metaverse experience for existing and prospective customers. Nike, Walmart, and the beauty brand Fenty are just some of the names that are now engaging consumers through Roblox's platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven Precedence Research's prediction that the metaverse market is set to grow at an annualized clip of 38% through 2033, Roblox shareholders have much to look forward to. It's just going to take some time for all of its upside to be fully realized.\n\n2. Ulta Beauty\n\nThese are tricky times for cosmetics and beauty-supply retailers. Department stores and general merchandise stores, once the industry's top destination for these goods, are losing their share of total foot traffic. Consumers are also more willing to try new, less mainstream brands and venues than they've been using in the past, which they're often finding online. These brands are also willing and able to sell directly to customers, bypassing retailers as middlemen altogether.\n\nUlta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) has seemingly defied if not outright benefited from the industry's evolution, however.\n\nIf you're not familiar with it, $20 billion makeup and beauty retailer Ulta does on the order of $12 billion worth of business per year, combining a strong online and offline presence. There are nearly 1,400 stores encompassing 14.6 million square feet worth of shopping space peppered all across the United States. The retailer handles a wide range of brand names, including Clinique, e.l.f., Mad Hippie, and Fur, just to name a few. Being able to offer this deep mix of goods and brands is a key reason it's done so well in a challenging environment; Ulta is the chief disruptor because it delivers consumers what they want, the way they want it -- a wide selection and convenient shopping options at a fair price.\n\nAdmittedly, Ulta Beauty stretches the definition of what's considered a growth stock. Its top-line growth is projected to remain in the single digits for at least the next several years. Chalk it up to the highly saturated market. The company underscored this competitive concern just a few days ago, too, by dialing back its full-year revenue outlook from a range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion to a lower range of only $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, ultimately pointing to the toll that the aforementioned economic malaise is taking on consumer spending. Even its competitive edge isn't quite enough right now.\n\nThis headwind was already factored into the stock's price, though. Ulta Beauty's shares are now 30% below March's high, 20% below analysts' consensus price target of $495.06, and trading at only around 15 times this year's expected per-share earnings of between $25.20 and $26.00. That's a bargain price, no matter how you look at it.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nLast but not least, add China's e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) to your list of growth stocks that Wall Street just isn't giving its due respect.\n\nAnyone keeping tabs on Alibaba (parent to e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall) likely knows the past few years have been miserable ones for stockholders. Although it obviously benefited from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the stock's price peaked in late 2020. Beijing began a sweeping regulatory crackdown in mid-2021, which didn't ease until the middle of this year. Even then, China's heavy-handed pandemic-prompted lockdowns held in place through late 2022 ended up doing more lingering damage to its economy than was foreseen.\n\nIn the meantime, the company itself seems to be struggling with self-management. Just since November, Alibaba has canceled its once-touted plans to spin off its cloud computing business as well as its logistics arm. The surprising plan reversals are a key reason shares haven't budged since the middle of 2022, and are still down 75% from their 2020 high.\n\nTake a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. Things are getting better.\n\nTake China's economy as an example. Challenges aside, the International Monetary Fund still contends that the country's GDP is going to grow by 5% this year. Consumer spending is healthy there, too. Beijing reports a 2.3% year-over-year improvement in April's retail sales. While that's not huge, any improvement on the April 2023 growth rate of 18.4% is impressive. Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao are particularly well positioned to capture more than their fair share of this spending growth. Mordor Intelligence says China's e-commerce market is set to grow at an annualized rate of more than 11% through 2029.\n\nThe company still has much to figure out, like which businesses it wants to be in and which ones it doesn't. Although it's sticking with its cloud computing and logistics operations right now, Alibaba is still restructuring, including replacing several key members of its management team. It's very much a work in progress.\n\nThe progress it's making is actually progressive, though, taking care of matters and refocusing the company in a way that remains underestimated by most investors. This is the overhaul that should have been underway prior to the pandemic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why We Think Ulta Beauty, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ULTA) CEO Compensation Is Not Excessive At All",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUlta Beauty to hold its Annual General Meeting on 11th of June Salary of US$1.35m is part of CEO Dave Kimbell's total remuneration The total compensation is similar to the average for the industry Over the past three years, Ulta Beauty's EPS grew by 45%  and over the past three years, the total shareholder return was 14%\n\nPerformance at Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) has been reasonably good and CEO Dave Kimbell has done a decent job of steering the company in the right direction. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 11th of June, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. We present our case of why we think CEO compensation looks fair.\n\nView our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty\n\nComparing Ulta Beauty, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nOur data indicates that Ulta Beauty, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$19b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$13m for the year to February 2024. We note that's a small decrease of 6.3% on last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$1.4m.\n\nFor comparison, other companies in the American Specialty Retail industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$14m. This suggests that Ulta Beauty remunerates its CEO largely in line with the industry average. Moreover, Dave Kimbell also holds US$14m worth of Ulta Beauty stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.\n\nComponent 2024 2023 Proportion (2024) Salary US$1.4m US$1.2m 11% Other US$11m US$12m 89% Total Compensation US$13m US$14m 100%\n\nOn an industry level, roughly 16% of total compensation represents salary and 84% is other remuneration. In Ulta Beauty's case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance. ceo-compensation\n\nA Look at Ulta Beauty, Inc.'s Growth Numbers\n\nUlta Beauty, Inc.'s earnings per share (EPS) grew 45% per year over the last three years. In the last year, its revenue is up 7.5%.\n\nThis demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. It's nice to see revenue heading northwards, as this is consistent with healthy business conditions. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nHas Ulta Beauty, Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nUlta Beauty, Inc. has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 14% over three years. But they probably don't want to see the CEO paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.\n\nTo Conclude...\n\nGiven that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. However, we still think that any proposed increase in CEO compensation will be examined closely to make sure the compensation is appropriate and linked to performance.\n\nCEO compensation is an important area to keep your eyes on, but we've also need to pay attention to other attributes of the company. In our study, we found 2 warning signs for Ulta Beauty you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.\n\nImportant note: Ulta Beauty is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something better in this list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

For our detailed discussion, go directly to the 17 Best Floral Perfumes to Wear This Spring And Beyond.\n\nGlobal Perfume Industry:\n\nAs we have noted in our article, \"20 Most Luxurious Feminine Perfumes in the World\", the global market for luxury fragrances was estimated to be worth $12.6 billion in 2023, as per IMARC Group.

        "title": "3 Sorry Retail Stocks To Sell In May While You Still Can",
        "content": "There are some retail brands that will always be in high demand. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), for example, will consistently remain a top competitor as long as it continues to be one of the most affordable places for consumers to buy the things they truly need. But there are plenty of retail stocks to sell right now that don\u2019t fall into the must-have category for shoppers.\n\nProviding products that are nice to have but aren\u2019t necessities means these retailers are feeling the pain the most as consumers feel the effects of a stagnating economy. Regardless of whether the economy is strong based on quantifiable metrics, many Americans still feel their dollar doesn\u2019t go as far anymore. This leads to a pullback on spending in categories that aren\u2019t seen as necessary, and that is when companies like the three on this list go from good bets to retail stocks to sell.\n\nLeslie\u2019s (LESL)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDuring the pandemic, there was a boom in pool building and upgrades. Stuck at home and with little to spend their money on, people were ready and willing to pour thousands of dollars into pool upgrades and repairs. But that excitement tapered off and consumers are now spending elsewhere or not at all. This shift directly impacted Leslie\u2019s (NASDAQ:LESL), the largest retailer of swimming pool supplies and products in the U.S.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMike Egeck, CEO of Leslie\u2019s, summed up many of the challenges manufacturers faced in 2023. \u201cUnfavorable weather, increased consumer price sensitivity and pool owners with an elevated level of chemicals left over from last year contributed to double-digit traffic decline,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, we absorbed elevated distribution costs and increased product costs, which impacted our margins.\u201d\n\nLeslie\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) in October 2020 initially capitalized on the pandemic-era spending on pools. But as of today, LESL stock is trading for 75% less than its opening price. Timing is everything, and the best time to buy Leslie\u2019s would have been before the pandemic even started \u2014 had the stock existed at the time. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like the pool industry will be bouncing back for the foreseeable future. LESL stock should definitely be on investor lists of retail stocks to sell.\n\nContainer Store Group (TCS) photo of the store front of a The Container Store (TCS) branded building\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nContainer Store Group (NYSE:TCS) is the kind of company that inherently can only thrive when times are good and the economy is strong. While the continued interest in aesthetically pleasing spaces has not necessarily declined, consumer\u2019s budgets have. Container Store Group\u2019s two largest brands are The Container Store and Closet Works, which offer storage solutions and custom closets, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nOstensibly, big box retailers like Walmart and Target (NYSE:TGT) offer the same products as The Container Store but for substantially less money. While the atmosphere and experience of shopping at The Container Store may appeal to some, it is hard for consumers to justify spending the difference on luxury items when the cost of the products they have to buy has gone up so dramatically.\n\nOptimistic company executives believe the company\u2019s \u201cstock market valuation does not reflect its intrinsic value.\u201d To that end, they are exploring the idea of selling the company. But who knows whether that will prove better or worse for the stock\u2019s value.\n\nSo far this year, TCS is down 71%. While it hit a high of $18.30 in early 2021, it has been on a steady decline since and is now trading at only 70 cents per share. The best time to sell this retail stock would have been years ago, but now is definitely the time to get out if you\u2019re still holding on. Otherwise, plan on holding onto it for the long haul until the economy makes a substantial rebound.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nPropelled forward in recent years by the beauty shopping habits of teenage girls, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) had seen a wave of increased sales. But while annual spending on beauty supplies among the teenage demographic is up 8%, it remains to be seen whether that trend continues.\n\nThe money teenagers are spending on themselves, according to self-reported data, is down 6% year-over-year (YOY). While parental contribution currently remains the same, a reduction in spending on their children\u2019s discretionary products is likely right around the corner. Ulta\u2019s CEO Dave Kimbell has warned that sales are starting to decline and the slowdown has been \u201ca bit earlier and bit bigger than we thought.\u201d\n\nAs for Ulta\u2019s adult customers who buy beauty products for themselves, this demographic is pulling back on spending at the store, and turning to more affordable retailers like Target and Walmart. Or they\u2019re choosing to go all in and splurge at Ulta\u2019s competitor, Sephora, which is often seen as a more high-end shopping experience.\n\nWhile ULTA is up 14% over the past five years, the stock is down 21% since January and 7.5% in the last year. If consumer discretionary spending continues to go down in the coming months, Ulta is definitely one of the retail stocks to sell now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the top country with the most beautiful women in Asia. If you want to learn about more countries, head straight to the 20 Countries with the Most Beautiful Women in Asia.\n\nThe Booming Beauty Industry: Trends and Growth in the Asia-Pacific and Global Markets\n\nThe global beauty industry is one of the keys to women\u2019s beauty.

(NYSE:EL), L\u2019Oreal, and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), among many others cannot be left behind. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)\u2019s breakthrough came in 1953 with the launch of Youth Dew, a bath oil that doubled as a fragrance, selling an unprecedented 50,000 bottles in its first year. In Q1 2024, The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)'s net sales decreased 10% year-over-year to $3.52 billion and organic net sales declined 11%. Their net earnings attributable to Estee Lauder plunged 94% to $31 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to the prior year.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a global leader in the beauty industry. Innovation is at the core of L'Or\u00e9al's success, with a significant investment of \u20ac1.29 billion in research and development in 2023, amounting to 3% of its sales. Loreals one notable example is the acquisition of Modiface in 2018 which is an AR company that enables consumers to virtually try on makeup and hair colors. In 2023, the company reported a staggering \u20ac38.2 billion in sales, with a remarkable operating profit of \u20ac7.7 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) has launched the Conscious Beauty initiative, which aims to provide transparency and education to customers about the products they offer. The Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) Charitable Foundation (UBCF) supports the well-being of women and teens, focusing on mind, body, and community well-being. In 2024, UBCF committed $3 million to nonprofit partners, in addition to the $60 million donated since 2016. The company partners with organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters, Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Dress for Success, Save the Children, and The Jed Foundation to support various causes. Ulta Beauty opened 247 new stores in 2022 and remodeled 20 stores with a new floor layout and design. In Q1 2024, Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA)'s operating income was $400.9 million or 14.7% of net sales, down from $442.1 million or 16.8% in the prior year.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, We\u2019ve ranked the countries with the most beautiful women in Asia based on a consensus-driven approach. We went through multiple sources and shortlisted the countries with most beautiful women and then assigned them scores.

We then ranked these countries in ascending order.\n\nTop Country with Most Beautiful Women in Asia\n\n1. South Korea\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 1\n\nSouth Korea tops the list for being one of the countries with the most beautiful women in Asia. Plastic surgery is very common in the country with a report highlighting that one in ever 5 women gets plastic surgery done.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA posted first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein both top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and sales increased year over year. The company\u2019s performance amid a dynamic operating landscape reflects its focus on transformational agenda, responsiveness to evolving market trends and expense management.\r\n\r\nManagement remains positive about the resilience of the beauty space and the company\u2019s solid differentiated model. However, it curtailed its net sales, comparable sales, operating margin and bottom-line guidance as it expects fiscal first-quarter operating challenges to persist.\n\nQuarterly Numbers\n\nUlta Beauty reported an EPS of $6.47 in the quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.19. However, the bottom line declined from $6.88 in the year-ago period.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote\n\nNet sales of this beauty product retailer advanced 3.5% year over year to $2,725.8 million compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,716 million. The uptick can be attributed to higher comparable sales, contributions from new stores, and increases in other revenues.\n\nComparable sales (sales for stores open for at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) jumped 1.6%. Our estimate for comparable sales growth stood at 2.5% for the fiscal first quarter. Comparable sales growth was driven by a 1.3% improvement in transactions and a 0.3% rise in the average ticket.\r\n\r\nThe gross profit advanced 1.4% to $1,069.8 million. The gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 39.2%, down 80 basis points year over year due to reduced merchandise margins and increased inventory shrink, somewhat compensated by higher other revenues. Our model suggested a gross margin contraction of 40 bps to 39.6%.\r\n\r\nSG&A expenses rose 8.8% to $665.9 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 24.4%, up 120 bps from the 23.2% reported in the year-ago quarter due to elevated corporate overheads for strategic investments, increased payroll and benefits, and escalated store costs. We expected the metric to expand 160 bps to 24.8% in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe operating income decreased 9.3% to $400.9 million. The operating margin contracted 210 bps to 14.7%.\n\nOther Updates\n\nUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $524.6 million. Net merchandise inventories were $1.9 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Stockholders\u2019 equity at the end of the quarter stood at $2,300.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.3 million for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe company repurchased 588,004 shares for $285.1 million in the quarter. As of May 4, 2024, Ulta Beauty had shares worth $1.8 billion left under its $2-billion buyback program announced in March 2024. Management expects to buy back shares worth $1 billion in fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2024, the capital expenditure is expected to be $415-$490 million.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, Ulta Beauty introduced 12 stores, relocated one and shuttered two. The company ended the fiscal first quarter with 1,395 stores totaling 14.6 million square feet. For fiscal 2024, ULTA expects 60-65 net new stores, along with 40-45 store remodeling and relocation projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuidance\n\nUlta Beauty expects fiscal 2024 net sales of $11.5-$11.6 billion compared with the earlier mentioned $11.7-$11.8 billion. The company reported net sales of $11.2 billion in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nComparable sales are expected to rise 2-3%, down from the 4-5% stated earlier. Management expects an operating margin between 13.7% and 14% compared with the previously mentioned 14-14.3%.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2024, earnings are envisioned to be $25.20-$26 per share, lower than the earlier stated $26.20-$27. Ulta Beauty\u2019s earnings came in at $26.03 per share in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has tumbled 20% in the past six months against the industry\u2019s growth of 12.4%.\n\nBetter-Ranked Retail Picks\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch ANF, a specialty retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

        "content": "Strengths: Robust financial performance with a growing net income and strong brand presence. Weaknesses: Intense competition and market saturation pose challenges. Opportunities: Expansion of digital and omnichannel capabilities can drive future growth. Threats: Economic downturns and shifts in consumer behavior could impact profitability.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA), the leading beauty retailer in the United States, has recently filed its 10-Q report on May 30, 2024. The company's financial health remains robust, with a net income increase from $347,051 thousand in the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023, to $313,113 thousand in the same period in 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net income, the company has maintained a strong balance sheet with total assets of $5.63 million thousand as of May 4, 2024. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest SEC filings, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of ULTA's current market position and future prospects.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CRM. Decoding Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nFinancial Performance and Brand Strength: Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) has demonstrated a solid financial performance with a net income of $313,113 thousand for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2024, despite a competitive retail landscape. The company's brand strength is evident from its extensive product offerings and services, which include a mix of makeup, fragrances, skin care, and hair care products, contributing to a diversified revenue stream. With a net sales increase to $2.73 million thousand in the same period, ULTA's ability to attract and retain customers through its loyalty programs and exclusive partnerships, such as the one with Target, further solidifies its market position.\n\nExpansive Store Network and Omnichannel Presence: ULTA's expansive store network, with 1,395 locations as of May 4, 2024, and its strategic omnichannel presence, provide a competitive edge. The company's stores, averaging 10,000 square feet, are strategically located in suburban strip centers, enhancing accessibility for consumers. Additionally, ULTA's e-commerce platform and mobile applications contribute to a seamless shopping experience, catering to the evolving preferences of beauty enthusiasts and driving sales both in-store and online.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOperating Expenses and Market Saturation: While ULTA's revenue has grown, the company's operating expenses have also increased, as evidenced by the rise in selling, general, and administrative expenses from $612,129 thousand to $665,913 thousand for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2024. This increase reflects the costs associated with maintaining a large physical presence and enhancing digital capabilities. Moreover, the beauty retail market is nearing saturation, with numerous competitors vying for market share, which could pressure margins and necessitate continuous investment to stay ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nInventory Management Challenges: The company's merchandise inventories have risen to $1.91 million thousand, indicating potential challenges in inventory management. Efficiently managing this aspect of the business is crucial to avoid overstocking or stockouts, which can lead to lost sales or increased markdowns. ULTA must continue to refine its inventory strategies to align with consumer demand and minimize the impact on cash flows and profitability.\n\nOpportunities\n\nDigital Expansion and Innovation: The ongoing digital transformation presents significant opportunities for ULTA to enhance its online presence and leverage data analytics for personalized marketing. Investing in innovative technologies and digital platforms can attract a broader customer base and foster loyalty. Additionally, the integration of augmented reality and virtual try-on features can enhance the online shopping experience, potentially increasing e-commerce sales.\n\nMarket Expansion and Diversification: ULTA has the opportunity to expand into new geographic markets and further diversify its product portfolio. Exploring international markets could open new revenue streams, while the introduction of exclusive product lines or collaborations with influencers can attract new customer segments. Furthermore, expanding the range of salon services offered in-store can create additional touchpoints with consumers and drive traffic to physical locations.\n\nThreats\n\nEconomic Sensitivity and Consumer Spending: As a retailer of discretionary products, ULTA's performance is sensitive to economic cycles. An economic downturn could lead to reduced consumer spending on beauty products and services, impacting the company's sales and profitability. Additionally, shifts in consumer behavior, such as the increasing preference for sustainable and clean beauty products, require ULTA to adapt its product offerings to meet these demands.\n\nCompetitive Pressure and Market Dynamics: The beauty industry is highly competitive, with new entrants and established players constantly innovating to capture market share. ULTA must navigate these dynamics while managing competitive pressures from e-commerce giants and specialty retailers. The company's ability to differentiate itself through exclusive products, superior customer service, and a compelling in-store experience will be critical in maintaining its competitive advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand presence, with opportunities for growth through digital expansion and market diversification. However, the company must address challenges related to operating expenses, inventory management, and economic sensitivity to sustain its success. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, ULTA can capitalize on emerging opportunities while mitigating potential threats in the dynamic beauty retail market.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) came out with quarterly earnings of $6.47 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.19 per share. This compares to earnings of $6.88 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.52%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this beauty products retailer would post earnings of $7.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.08, delivering a surprise of 7.88%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nUlta , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $2.73 billion for the quarter ended April 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.37%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.63 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nUlta shares have lost about 22.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.4%.\n\nWhat's Next for Ulta?\n\nWhile Ulta has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ulta: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $5.92 on $2.64 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $26.22 on $11.67 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Five Below (FIVE), is yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024. The results are expected to be released on June 5.\n\nThis discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nFive Below's revenues are expected to be $832.73 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Ulta's (NASDAQ:ULTA) Q1 Earnings Results: Revenue In Line With Expectations\n\nBeauty, cosmetics, and personal care retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) reported results in line with analysts' expectations in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 3.5% year on year to $2.73 billion. On the other hand, the company's full-year revenue guidance of $11.55 billion at the midpoint came in 1.4% below analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $6.47 per share, down from its profit of $6.88 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Ulta? Find out in our full research report.\n\nUlta (ULTA) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue$2.73 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.73 billion (small miss) EPS: $6.47 vs analyst estimates of $6.28 (3% beat) The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year from $11.75 billion to $11.55 billion at the midpoint, a 1.7% decrease Gross Margin (GAAP): 39.2%, down from 40% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $68.32 million, down 65% from the same quarter last year Locations: 1,395 at quarter end, up from 1,359 in the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales rose 1.6% year on year Market Capitalization: $18.13 billion\n\n\u201cThe Ulta Beauty team delivered net sales growth of 3.5% and comparable sales growth of 1.6% in a dynamic operating environment. I am proud of how our teams continued to execute our transformational agenda, adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace, and thoughtfully manage expenses across the enterprise,\u201d said Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOffering high-end prestige brands as well as lower-priced, mass-market ones, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an American retailer that sells makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products.\n\nBeauty and Cosmetics Retailer\n\nBeauty and cosmetics retailers understand that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but a little lipstick, nail polish, and glowing skin also help the cause. These stores\u2014which mostly cater to consumers but can also garner the attention of salon pros\u2014aim to be a one-stop personal care and beauty products shop with many brands across many categories. E-commerce is changing how consumers buy cosmetics, so these retailers are constantly evolving to meet the customer where and how they want to shop.\n\nSales Growth\n\nUlta is larger than most consumer retail companies and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge over its competitors.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 10.3% over the last five years was decent as it opened new stores and grew sales at existing, established stores. Ulta Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Ulta's revenue grew 3.5% year on year to $2.73 billion, falling short of Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 5% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nUlta's demand within its existing stores has generally risen over the last two years but lagged behind the broader consumer retail sector. On average, the company's same-store sales have grown by 8.8% year on year. With positive same-store sales growth amid an increasing physical footprint of stores, Ulta is reaching more customers and growing sales. Ulta Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, Ulta's same-store sales rose 1.6% year on year. By the company's standards, this growth was a meaningful deceleration from the 9.3% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago. We'll be watching Ulta closely to see if it can reaccelerate growth.\n\nKey Takeaways from Ulta's Q1 Results\n\nWe struggled to find many strong positives in these results. Although its EPS beat analysts' estimates thanks to its better-than-expected same-store sales growth (1.6% vs estimates of 1.5%), its full-year revenue and earnings guidance missed Wall Street's projections.\n\nHowever, this weaker outlook was already baked into the stock price given CEO Dave Kimbell's bearish comments during the middle of the quarter, where he stated the company is seeing a slight pullback in consumer spending. Peer company elf Beauty also posted a bad quarter earlier this month, so investors anticipated Ulta's results. The company is down 1.6% after reporting and currently trades at $379.48 per share.\n\nUlta may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

I am proud of how our teams continued to execute our transformational agenda, adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace, and thoughtfully manage expenses across the enterprise,\" said Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer. \"We have a clear plan to accelerate our momentum and continue delivering a best-in-class assortment and engaging experiences for our guests. I remain confident in our differentiated model, the resilience of the beauty category, and our ability to execute against our plans, but we have adjusted our annual guidance as we anticipate the dynamics we faced in the first quarter to continue for the balance of the year.\"\n\nFirst Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Compared to First Quarter of Fiscal 2023\n\nNet sales increased 3.5% to $2.7 billion compared to $2.6 billion, primarily due to increased comparable sales, new store contribution, and growth in other revenue. Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 1.6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, driven by a 1.3% increase in transactions and a 0.3% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 1.4% to $1.07 billion compared to $1.05 billion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 39.2% compared to 40.0%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink, partially offset by growth in other revenue. Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased 8.8% to $665.9 million compared to $612.1 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 24.4% compared to 23.2%, primarily due to higher corporate overhead for strategic investments, higher store payroll and benefits, and higher store expenses. Operating income was $400.9 million, or 14.7% of net sales, compared to $442.1 million, or 16.8% of net sales. The tax rate increased to 23.2% compared to 22.8% primarily due to a reduced benefit from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Net income was $313.1 million compared to $347.1 million. Diluted earnings per share was $6.47, including a $0.10 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $6.88, including a $0.14 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $524.6 million.\n\nMerchandise inventories, net at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to $1.9 billion compared to $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brand launches, 36 net new stores, and an increase in distribution center inventory primarily due to the opening of the market fulfillment center in Greer, SC.\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company repurchased 588,004 shares of its common stock at a cost of $285.1 million. As of May 4, 2024, $1.8 billion remained available under the $2.0 billion share repurchase program announced in March 2024.\n\nStore Update\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we opened 12 new stores, closed two stores, and relocated one store. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 the Company operated 1,395 stores totaling 14.6 million square feet.\n\nFiscal 2024 Outlook\n\nThe Company has updated its outlook for fiscal 2024.\n\nPrior FY24 Outlook Updated FY24 Outlook Net sales $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion Comparable sales 4% to 5% 2% to 3% New stores, net 60-65 no change Remodel and relocation projects 40-45 no change Operating margin 14.0% to 14.3% 13.7% to 14.0% Diluted earnings per share $26.20 to $27.00 $25.20 to $26.00 Share repurchases approximately $1 billion no change Interest income approximately $11 million approximately $13 million Effective tax rate approximately 24.3% approximately 24% Capital expenditures $415 million to $490 million no change Depreciation and amortization expense $275 million to $280 million $270 million to $275 million\n\nConference Call Information\n\nA conference call to discuss first quarter of fiscal 2024 results is scheduled for today, May 30, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 3:30 p.m. CT.

        "content": "Too often, investors will focus on the banner names in the news, buying stocks that have already received accolades. While running with a winner isn\u2019t a bad strategy, it often misses the bigger opportunities with under-the-radar stocks hidden in plain sight.\n\nLooking for under-the-radar stocks that represent a good opportunity without having to run the risk of buying penny stocks might be an excellent way to juice your portfolio\u2019s returns. The three companies below are such out-of-the-way investments offering breakout potential and should be considered a buy.\n\nExlService Holding (EXLS) Chatbot conversation Ai Artificial Intelligence technology online customer service. Digital chatbot, robot application, OpenAI generate. financial investment stock market. Virtual assistant on internet. AI stocks\n\nSource: khunkornStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nA virtually unknown artificial intelligence (AI) stock ready for a breakout is ExlService Holding (NASDAQ:EXLS), a hidden gem of a data analytics company. While more prominent Big Data AI stocks like Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) grab all the headlines, ExlService is smartly growing behind the scenes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe contrast is stark. Palantir Technologies recently turned profitable, notching six consecutive quarters of GAAP earnings, while ExlService has been churning out growing profits for over a decade. Revenue has also tripled since 2013, growing from $478 million 10 years ago to over $1.6 billion last year. Palantir had $608 million in sales last year.\n\nExlService Holding targets key industries, primarily insurance, healthcare, banking and financial services. According to a recent note from Citi analysts, data and AI-powered operations account for 51% of total revenue and have grown at a compounded rate of 32% annually since 2020.\n\nEXLS stock trades at just 15 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates, with Wall Street forecasting 15% annual long-term profit growth. At less than twice its sales, ExlService Holding is an under-the-radar stock with substantial breakout potential.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeauty products and personal care leader Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is not a hidden gem in the traditional sense of the meaning. However, as retail comes under increased pressure from high inflation and high interest rates, Ulta possesses significant breakout potential. It is poised to report fiscal first-quarter earnings, and regardless of which way they go, investors should be alert to the opportunity.\n\nData from location intelligence data specialist Placer.ai shows that Ulta Beauty still excels while the broader beauty and wellness segment is suffering from a slowdown in consumer visits. The year-over-year growth may have moderated, but it continues to perform ahead of itself and the industry. Placer.ai\u2019s Bracha Arnold notes, \u201cThe beauty giant continues to thrive \u2014 drawing even more visitors in early 2024 than during the equivalent period of last year.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nUltra Beauty should continue outperforming, too. Cosmetics and other beauty care products are affordable indulgences. Even during recessions, consumers will splurge on such products when they can\u2019t afford more expensive purchases. There\u2019s even a name for it: the Lipstick Effect.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve balks at cutting interest rates because of inflation\u2019s stubborn tenacity, look to Ulta Beauty to outperform expectations over time.\n\nKoppers Holdings (KOP) Railroad tracks with a junction\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSupplying crossties to railroads and telephone poles to utilities doesn\u2019t sound like an especially exciting business, but that makes Koppers Holdings (NYSE:KOP) such a hidden gem.\u00a0 The recent earnings miss and subsequent 20% drop in this under-the-radar stock allows investors to buy in before the rebound breakout.\n\nThe miss was due to business in some of its segments being slower than even management anticipated. Some of that was due to projects getting delayed due to grants not being as quickly deployed as expected, but business will ultimately materialize. Moreover, a recent acquisition provides some near-term earnings pressure even as it provides long-term growth opportunities.\n\nBefore the earnings miss, Koppers Holdings had been up 65% for the past year, triple the gains of the S&P 500. While that\u2019s since narrowed, the telephone and railroad tie company still leads. Shares trade at just 8 times earnings estimates, a fraction of sales and well below estimated long-term earnings growth rates. It makes Koppers an excellent candidate for a breakout performance once business gets back on track.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Ulta Earnings: What To Look For From ULTA\n\nBeauty, cosmetics, and personal care retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) will be reporting results tomorrow after market close. Here's what to look for.\n\nUlta met analysts' revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $3.55 billion, up 10.2% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company:\u00a0Ulta beat analysts' same store sales, revenue, and gross margin expectations. In addition, its EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, while full year revenue guidance was roughly in line, its full-year earnings forecast was underwhelming and missed.\n\nIs Ulta a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Ulta's revenue to grow 3.5% year on year to $2.73 billion, slowing from the 12.3% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $6.28 per share. Ulta Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Ulta has a history of exceeding Wall Street's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 4% on average.\n\nLooking at Ulta's peers in the specialty retail segment, only Sally Beauty has reported results so far. It met analysts' revenue estimates, posting year-on-year sales declines of 1.1%. The stock was down 1.4% on the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Sally Beauty's earnings results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the specialty retail segment, with share prices up 9.3% on average over the last month. Ulta is down 5.8% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $506.4 (compared to the current share price of $381.29).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA is likely to register top-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on May 30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.72 billion, which suggests an increase of 3.2% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nHowever, the bottom line is likely to decline year over year. The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has decreased by 1 cent in the past seven days to $6.23 per share. This indicates a decline of 9.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. Nonetheless, ULTA has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.4%, on average.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nFavorable trends in the beauty space keep Ulta Beauty well-positioned for the quarter under review. The company has been benefiting from healthy traffic trends, greater brand awareness and the expansion of its loyalty program. Ulta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out, thanks to consumers\u2019 rising interest in self-care and the company\u2019s focus on newness and innovation. Management\u2019s transformational initiatives have also been yielding positively.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s focus on its six strategic priorities has been aiding. These include strengthening its omnichannel business, undertaking various tools to enhance the guest experience, providing customers with a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation, deepening customer engagement by boosting rewards and loyalty programs and optimizing the cost structure.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote\n\nWhile the macroeconomic landscape remains dynamic in the near term, management expressed optimism about the beauty industry's resilience on its last earnings call, highlighting growth opportunities for the company. Our model suggests a 2.5% increase in same-store sales for the quarter under review. \u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, ULTA expects the gross margin to decline modestly in fiscal 2024 due to soft merchandise margins and supply-chain cost deleverage, which raises concerns for the to-be-reported quarter as well. We expect a gross margin contraction of 40 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, management expects SG&A deleverage in fiscal 2024 due to wage pressure, efforts to support core traffic and a focus on the transformational agenda. SG&A is expected to rise by the high single digits in fiscal 2024, including a low-double-digit increase in the first half. We expect an SG&A expense increase of 11.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, with the rate likely to expand 160 basis points to 24.8%.\r\n\r\nManagement expects a decline in the bottom line in the first half due to significant SG&A and gross margin deleverage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ulta Beauty this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nUlta Beauty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, while it has an Earnings ESP of -1.64%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.\r\n\r\nBath & Body Works BBWI currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.23% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share is pegged at 33 cents, flat year over year. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nBath & Body Works\u2019 top line is expected to decline year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.37 billion, which indicates a drop of 2.1% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. BBWI has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 23.2%, on average.\r\n\r\nDollar Tree DLTR currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register a top-line increase when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree\u2019s quarterly revenues is pegged at $7.6 billion, which implies growth of 4.2% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree\u2019s quarterly earnings of $1.43 suggests a drop of 2.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels. DLTR has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 1.9%, on average.\r\n\r\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters AEO currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.98% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to register an increase in the bottom line when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point higher as traders return to their desks after a public holiday on Monday. The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure later in the week is due to headline this week's economic calendar, while an ebbing stream of corporate earnings could provide a glimpse into the health of the American consumer.\n\n1. Futures tick higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged into the green on Tuesday, with investors looking ahead to key inflation data during this holiday-shortened trading week.\n\nBy 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had added 9 points or 0.2%, Nasdaq 100 futures had gained 58 points or 0.3%, and Dow futures had climbed by 40 points or 0.1%.\n\nStock markets on Wall Street were closed for Memorial Day on Monday.\n\nHighlighting the economic calendar this week is May's personal consumption expenditures price index on Friday, widely known as the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. Fed officials have recently suggested that they would like to see more proof that price gains in the U.S. are sustainably cooling toward the central bank's stated 2% target before rolling out any potential interest rate cuts this year.\n\n2. Consumer confidence data ahead\n\nA relatively light schedule of economic releases Tuesday will feature the latest reading of the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey.\n\nAnalysts expect the May figure, which is viewed as a potential leading indicator of consumer spending, to fall slightly to a mark of 96.0, down from 97.0 in the previous month.\n\nThe number sank to its lowest level more than 1-1/2 years in April as Americans fretted over elevated prices for essentials like food and gas, as well as income and the availability of jobs.\n\n\"Confidence retreated further in April [....] as consumers became less positive about the current labor market situation,\" Dana Peterson, Chief Economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement.\n\n3. Earnings season ebbs\n\nThe quarterly parade of earnings continues to slow, although several companies are still gearing up to their unveil their latest returns in the coming days.\n\nAmong them is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), who will report following the close of markets on Wednesday. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have said that they expect the business software group to roughly meet Wall Street expectations thanks in part to a recovery in spending by small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nElsewhere, members-only retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and beauty store chain Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) are tipped to provide a further glimpse into the state of the U.S. shopper when they report after the bell on Thursday. Consumers have recently showed signs that they are paring back expenditures on nonessential items in response to sticky inflation and higher interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Alibaba Health surges\n\nHong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Health Information Technology (HK:0241) spiked on Tuesday after the firm clocked a jump in its annual earnings on improved margins and strong demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals on its platforms.\n\nThe company, which was acquired by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) in 2014, posted a nearly 91% surge in adjusted net profit to 1.44 billion yuan ($200 million) for the year to March 31.\n\nRevenue rose about 1% to 27.03 billion yuan, as sales appeared to be stagnating after COVID-led demand sparked stellar sales growth over the past three years. But Alibaba Health benefited from improved margins, especially on its online healthcare services, as well as pharmaceutical sales.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nCrude prices hovered around the flatline, rebounding from recent losses ahead of a meeting by major producers to decide future output levels.\n\nBy 03:23 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) inched up 0.2% to $78.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract traded down by 0.1% at $82.83 per barrel. Oil prices rose over 1% on Monday in muted trade owing to public holidays in the U.K. and the U.S., after sinking to the lowest levels since early-February last week.\n\nAll eyes are now on the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, which is set to take place online on June 2. Much of the focus will be on whether the cartel will extend its current voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day into the second half of the year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. futures tick higher, consumer confidence survey ahead - what's moving markets\n\nIsraeli-Turkish trade on life support as relations hit bottom\n\nLondon Stock Exchange Group Plc.

        "title": "This Market-Beating Stock Is at Its Cheapest Level in Years: Should You Buy Today?",
        "content": "It used to be smooth sailing for Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) shareholders. The retailer, focused on the beauty market, has beaten the market since going public close to 20 years ago. It's now up 1,190% compared to the S&P 500's 381% total return.\n\nUnfortunately, this year has not been so kind. Ulta's stock is down 22% year to date even though the S&P 500 is up 12% and pushing through to all-time highs on the back of the artificial intelligence boom. Investors are worried about slowing growth at the brand's retail locations, and the stock now trades at its cheapest earnings multiple in years.\n\nWhat happened to Ulta Beauty stock, and is it a buy at this discounted price? Let's look closer and find out.\n\nUlta Beauty: Specialty beauty at scale\n\nUlta Beauty is a retailer that caters specifically to the beauty market. This mainly includes women, with a skew toward capturing the younger millennial and Gen Z beauty spenders. It estimates there are 70 million beauty \"enthusiasts\" who are its target, recurring customers in the United States.\n\nWith an omnichannel strategy that includes robust e-commerce sales, Ulta believes it can be the go-to shopping destination for any beauty customer around the country. So far, this has proven true with an astounding 43 million shoppers currently on its Ulta loyalty program.\n\nThis focus on a single niche has resonated with many shoppers. Ulta did $11.2 billion in revenue last year, up from $10.2 billion a year prior. Ten years ago, it was only doing $3 billion in annual revenue. With a $112 billion beauty-products market in the United States, the company still has a long runway to steal market share from legacy operators like department stores and mass merchandisers. As long as it keeps up its superior customer offering, I think it can do just that.\n\nComp sales slow, but that's nothing to be concerned about\n\nIf the company keeps growing, why is the stock down? It all comes down to comparable-sales growth, which is a retail metric that measures revenue growth from existing locations a year prior. Last quarter, Ulta reported comp sales of just 2.5%, which was its 11th straight quarter of slowing same-store sales growth. This is a concern among investors because if this trend continues, Ulta will hit negative comparable-sales growth soon, which will hurt its profit margins and earnings per share (EPS).\n\nShares of Ulta fell sharply after putting out this report, indicating that Wall Street was underwhelmed by these numbers. I believe these analysts may be overreacting and only focused on the next quarter, which long-term investors can take advantage of.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor one, comparable-sales growth is still positive. Second, many retailers are facing comparable-sales growth pressure this year as inflation subsides on consumer goods. The company put up phenomenal comparable-sales growth in 2021 and 2022 in the double digits. Now, it is lapping these periods and putting up weaker numbers with inflation down.\n\nThis year, Ulta is guiding for 4% to 5% comparable-sales growth. This will be an important number to track not just this year but over the next few years to see whether Ulta is still gaining market share in the beauty space. ULTA Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nULTA Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nIs the stock cheap today?\n\nToday, the market is worried about a short-term deceleration in Ulta's comparable-sales growth. This has brought the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) to its lowest level in years. It currently trades at a P/E of 14.5. This seems much too cheap for a company with this level of earnings growth.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Ulta's EPS has grown at a cumulative 644%, driven by new store openings, positive comparable-sales growth, and share repurchases. Shares outstanding are down 25% in the last 10 years for reference.\n\nWith still plenty of white space to grow in the United States (not to mention internationally), guidance for positive same-store sales in 2024 and beyond, and a cheap stock to buy back shares, I think Ulta Beauty can continue growing EPS at a high rate for many years into the future. A P/E of 14.5 is too good of an offer to pass up for a company with this history of earnings growth and prospects for future earnings growth.\n\nNow looks like a great time to back up the truck and buy some Ulta Beauty for your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ulta Beauty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ulta Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Building a portfolio that\u00a0can see you\u00a0through retirement requires finding stocks that can not only enjoy capital appreciation but also\u00a0income generation. The\u00a0makes dividend\u00a0growth stocks an important component of an investor\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\nDividend growth investing has\u00a0proved\u00a0to be the best method of amassing generational wealth. It is better than buying bonds, gold, real estate\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or even non-dividend-paying stocks! That\u2019s because historically dividends have made up as much as 40% of the S&P 500\u2018s annual return going all the way back to 1930.\u00a0It\u2019s been an amazingly consistent track record that investors can use to their advantage.\n\nWhat follows are three of the best growth stocks to buy for building a lifetime of riches.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first growth stock investors should consider buying is\u00a0Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). The beauty products and personal care leader has a phenomenal track record of creating expanding shareholder value.\n\nOver the past decade,\u00a0Ulta has quadrupled in value with a 343% return for investors.\u00a0And despite\u00a0my highlighting the importance of finding dividend growth stocks to buy, the beauty care company\u00a0actually\u00a0does not pay a dividend. So why recommend it?\u00a0Because\u00a0I think it can and will pay one in the near future.\n\nUlta has a terrific decade-long history of sharply growing sales, profits\u00a0and\u00a0free cash flow (FCF) per share. At the same\u00a0time\u00a0it has reduced the number of shares outstanding and embarked on a pattern of reducing its debt. So\u00a0far\u00a0Ulta has been using its significant FCF generation to create a lean, financially sound business. But because FCF per share now exceeds $20\u00a0it is clear that Ulta Beauty can readily support paying a generous dividend to shareholders.\n\nWhile the stock market\u00a0crushed\u00a0the stock over the past few months on concerns over a dicey economy impacting consumers, that is a transitory situation and the outlook over the next decade is quite healthy.\u00a0With plans for expansion into Mexico, Ulta Beauty is a deeply discounted growth stock to buy.\n\nS&P Global (SPGI) Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&P Global (SPGI)\n\nSource: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nS&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), on the other hand,\u00a0is a dividend growth stock that should be high on your list.\u00a0Arguably best known as the owner of numerous stock market indices, most notably the S&P 500, the \u200b\u200bfinancial information and analytics firm is poised for exceptional growth for the next\u00a010\u00a0years and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has richly rewarded shareholders with a total return of more than 500% over the past decade. While the yield of under 1% is nothing to write home about, S&P Global regularly increases the payout every year. In 2013, it paid a dividend of $1.12 per share\u00a0but\u00a0with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7%, the\u00a0annualized payout is now $3.64 per share. More impressive, S&P Global has grown its FCF by a muscular 17.7% CAGR.\n\nBecause it has a low earnings-based payout ratio of 43% and an even lower 32% FCF payout ratio,\u00a0the financial services firm\u00a0has plenty of cash available to keep paying its dividend and raising the payout. The payout ratio indicates how much\u00a0cash\u00a0it\u00a0is using\u00a0after paying its bills to pay its dividend.\u00a0Lower is better and S&P Global\u2019s is well within the\u00a0margin of\u00a0safety.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last growth stock to buy is tech titan\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Its 10-year track record of generating shareholder returns is unparalleled. Its total return over that\u00a0time period\u00a0is 1,150%, for a CAGR of over 29%. In comparison, the S&P 500 has returned less than 234%. That\u2019s nearly a five-to-one outperformance by the software giant.\n\nAs is\u00a0well-known\u00a0by now, Microsoft has fully embraced artificial intelligence (AI) as its long-term growth strategy. Integrating the technology throughout its products and services has made Microsoft one of the premier AI stocks on the market. It even makes its own AI chip called Maia.\u00a0Shares\u00a0are up 35% over the past year\u00a0as a result and\u00a0yet it still trades at about 2x sales.\n\nDespite this tremendous growth, Wall Street still sees more room to run. Analysts forecast earnings will grow 16% annually for the next five years. They may be underselling it.\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s cloud services business Azure is one of the fastest growing opportunities, making it essential\u00a0to\u00a0businesses\u00a0moving\u00a0their data to the cloud.\u00a0It is the second\u00a0biggest\u00a0cloud business behind\u00a0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0dividend also yields less than 1% but it has grown the annualized payout from 97 cents a decade ago to\u00a0$3.00 per share today. That\u2019s a 10% CAGR with FCF growing more than 9% annually.\n\nThe past 10 years have been amazing for investors but the next 10 should\u00a0see it\u00a0only pad that lead.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "As spending on beauty slows, consumers shift to premium products",
        "content": "US beauty sales slowed in the first quarter of 2024, but consumers are still looking for premium products.\n\nA recent report by Circana found that the prestige beauty industry category saw revenue grow by 9% year over year in Q1. In comparison, the mass market beauty category \u2014 typically drugstore brands \u2014 grew by 2% during the same time period.\n\nPrestige cosmetics mainly consist of brands sold in department stores and boutique-style shops like Sephora (LVMUY) and often belong to a higher echelon in terms of presentation, ingredients, and pricing. In 2023, sales in the category reached $31.7 billion.\n\n\"We're seeing a very strong Q1 in the prestige cosmetic space,\" Orveon CEO Neela Montgomery told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Orveon owns cosmetics brands bareMinerals and Laura Mercier.\n\nAccording to Montgomery, Orveon experienced \"strong, double-digit, and double the rate of category growth\" in the first quarter of the year.\n\n\"But you talk about the broader market \u2014 and this is a sort of 'lipstick effect' that people often talk about in beauty \u2014 we're seeing that prestige is growing at a much faster rate than the mass beauty market,\" she said, adding: \"Those at the higher price points and more luxury positioning and iconic products such as ourselves continue to do well.\"\n\nThe lipstick effect refers to the notion that consumers will still spend money on small luxury items even during economic downturns or when they are low on personal funds. While overall spending on cosmetics is finally normalizing after several strong years of sales growth, consumers are still spending money on prestige items.\n\nAccording to a 2023 McKinsey & Company report, the \"premiumization\" trend in beauty and fragrance is expected to continue in the coming years. McKinsey anticipates the prestige beauty category will grow 8% per year between 2022 and 2027, versus a 5% growth rate for mass beauty.\n\nSephora, a subsidiary of parent company LVMH, had a standout first quarter as the retailer continued opening more stores across the US amid high demand. Rare Beauty and Fenty Beauty, two celebrity-owned companies, are among the most popular cosmetic brands at stores like Sephora and are considered fast-growing.

However, he noted, \"there's a lot of positive signs about how they're engaging with our new brands in stores, online, connecting with our business.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the \"dynamic\" environment for beauty spending, the prestige category is a focus area that Ulta needs to drive improvement on, Kimbell said, adding that the retailer actually \"saw strength in mass ... and then [was] more challenged in prestige.\"\n\n\"We have, on the prestige side, 1,000 new points of distribution in prestige area that is having some impact on our business,\" he said. \"But we're confident in our ability to go through. Our intent, of course, over time is to gain share in every part of our business.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nClick here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Analysts Estimate Ulta Beauty (ULTA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reports results for the quarter ended April 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis beauty products retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.73 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.58% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ulta?\n\nFor Ulta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.35%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ulta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ulta would post earnings of $7.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.08, delivering a surprise of +7.88%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nUlta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.96 per share for the quarter ended April 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -12.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.94 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Dick's has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.64%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dick's will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) closed at $378.33, marking a -0.92% move from the previous day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.27%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.51%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.19%.\n\nShares of the beauty products retailer witnessed a loss of 8.93% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its gain of 5.78% and the S&P 500's gain of 7.34%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Ulta Beauty in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on May 30, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $6.24, down 9.3% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.73 billion, up 3.47% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $26.43 per share and revenue of $11.72 billion, which would represent changes of +1.54% and +4.58%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Ulta Beauty. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance.

This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 12.8 of its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that ULTA currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.57. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this beauty products retailer have returned -8.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, which Ulta falls in, has gained 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $6.24 per share, indicating a change of -9.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.5%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.04 indicates a change of +9.9% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ulta.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Ulta, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.72 billion and $12.44 billion estimates indicate +4.6% and +6.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nUlta reported revenues of $3.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $8.08 for the same period compares with $6.68 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +7.88%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nUlta is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "This Beaten-Down Stock Has Crushed the Market Over the Past 10 Years, and It Could Head 71% Higher This Year, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "If you've ever seen a stock price chart, you know that stock movements, whether up or down, are never linear.\n\nSometimes, the way the stock behaves in the short term can influence investors to make poor decisions. A price jump can get investors excited, leading them to buy in only to see the stock fall. A drop can scare investors into selling shares of a company they had good reason to buy, leaving them to miss out on its recovery.\n\nNobody can consistently time the market, which is one of the reasons long-term buy-and-hold investing is the best way to go for retail investors.\n\nConsider, for example, Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA). The stock is down 22% over the past year, seriously underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 28% at the same time. But it has been a phenomenal stock to own over the long haul, and it has crushed the broader market's gains over the past 10 years, even with its recent drop.\n\nAt least one Wall Street analyst sees a major upside. Is now a good time to buy?\n\nBuilding up a beauty empire\n\nUlta was a beauty industry disrupter when it opened its first stores more than 30 years ago, and it remains a differentiated contender in the industry today. Beauty has historically been split into two categories: upscale and expensive or mass and cheap. You would find upscale products at the department store and cheap products at the pharmacy.\n\nUlta has turned that binary on its head, selling products across a wide range of prices in its megastores, in addition to accessories. It also provides salon and beauty services that its peers don't offer.\n\nThe original categories still exist in this space, but today, there's a third: the direct-to-consumer segment, which ranges across both branded physical stores and e-commerce. Ulta still stands out with comprehensive offerings that straddle all three beauty categories.\n\nUlta's management understood something that's still at the core of its business: Beauty enthusiasts usually don't relegate themselves to just one category of products -- they'll purchase from all of them. In the past, a consumer would have to go to different venues for different types of products. At Ulta, they can find all of them under one roof.\n\nThere are two other main elements of Ulta's unique and successful model. One is its loyalty program. Beauty enthusiasts are steady in their shopping habits, and 95% of all sales at Ulta come from program members. Its services segment is also a major element of Ulta's model and reinforces loyalty.\n\nManaging through inflation\n\nUlta has been reliably able to increase its sales and profits, but it has been struggling somewhat due to inflation. Since its customers come from a wide range of socioeconomic levels and it sells nonessential products, it's susceptible to shoppers holding back on discretionary spending when their budgets are under pressure. And since it offers wares across a wide gamut of prices, it's susceptible to its shoppers switching down when penny-pinching.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the macroeconomic circumstances, its performance last fiscal year was admirable. Sales rose almost 10% in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Feb. 3, 2024), and more than 10% in its fiscal fourth quarter. Comparable sales increased 2.5% in Q4 -- a slowdown in growth, but still an increase.\n\nThe good news is that its customers are remaining loyal, even if they're buying cheaper products. That's reflected in the fact that transactions were up 4.5%, but the average ticket was down 1.9%. Ulta even managed to boost earnings per share (EPS) by 21% to $8.08, and expanded its operating margin from 13.9% in fiscal 2022 to 14.5% in fiscal 2023.\n\nThese earnings results were strong, but management gave a tepid outlook that disappointed investors. It guided for a 4% to 5% increase in comparable sales for fiscal 2024 with EPS of $26 to $27, which implies little to no growth. And its operating margin is expected to be in the 14% to 14.3% range -- below the 2023 level of 15%.\n\nBargain stock or value trap?\n\nThe market's strong disappointment looks more like a reaction to unmet expectations than finding fault in the business. Some companies like to provide conservative guidance so that they can beat it rather than fall short. Even if it isn't conservative, Ulta's forecast points more to external trends than problems in the business. Ulta looks healthy right now. It has plenty of growth opportunities, both from opening new stores and unlocking value from its loyal customers.\n\nCurrently, Ulta trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15. It has rarely had a lower valuation, and then only briefly. Wall Street's average target price for the company over the next 12 to 18 months is 40% higher than today's price, and analyst Michael Lasser of UBS Group sees it heading 71% higher.\n\nThis looks like a bargain to me. Ulta could trade sideways while the macro trends are against it, but if it reports an earnings beat, the stock will jump.

        "content": "Investors in Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 21, 2024 $190 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Ulta Beauty shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Ulta Beauty is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry that ranks in the Top 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while two analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $6.26 per share to $6.25 in that period.\r\n\r\nGiven the way analysts feel about Ulta Beauty right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "title": "May\u2019s Markdowns: 7 Bargain Stocks the Street Overlooked",
        "content": "With the market continuing to generally rise above a wall of worries, the concept of bargain stocks to buy might seem sadly irrelevant. However, with so many opportunities available, it\u2019s not possible to provide equal coverage to every company. In other words, some ideas will slip through the cracks.\n\nFor those who have procrastinated on this bull run, that\u2019s good news. While Wall Street has certainly ogled heavily hyped names, there are ideas that haven\u2019t quite grabbed the spotlight. Nevertheless, they deserve a closer look.\n\nSometimes, the item you buy at the local garage sale could be a huge hit. On that note, below are bargain stocks to buy that the Street overlooked.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNew Fortress Energy (NFE) a gas pipe with the sun going down in the background, natural\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOperating in the utilities (regulated gas) sector, New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) conducts business as an integrated gas-to-power energy infrastructure enterprise. It provides energy and development services to end-users worldwide. The company is dividend into two main units, one focused on terminals and infrastructure development and the other on shipping. Priced at $28.86 on Tuesday, NFE is close to its 52-week low.\n\nOrdinarily, that might not be a great signal to acquire security. However, NFE makes an intriguing case for bargain stocks to buy. For one thing, the underlying business is exceptionally relevant. Number two, while its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.35X isn\u2019t exactly undervalued, in the fourth quarter of last year, this metric stood at 3.56X. So, on a relative basis, it appears to be a deal.\n\nBest of all, covering experts project robust growth for the next two years. By the end of fiscal 2024, they anticipate sales of $3.07 billion, up 27.3% from last year\u2019s haul of $2.41 billion. By 2025, the top line could rise to $4.09 billion, up 33% from projected 2024 sales.\n\nMosaic (MOS) Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the basic materials segment, Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) is involved in agricultural inputs. Per its public profile, the company produces and markets concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients in North America and other international markets. As a major player in the global food supply chain, MOS commands significant relevance. Notably, experts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $36.64 price target.\n\nDespite its relevance, though, MOS is down almost 18% since the start of the year. In the past 52 weeks, a similar magnitude of red ink materialized. Further, at $30.08, it\u2019s very close to the trough of the trailing one-year period. However, despite these concerns, Mosaic could rank among the bargain stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of the issue is the low consensus target for the top line. In fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate revenue to land at $11.97 billion. That\u2019s down 12.6% from last year\u2019s print of $13.7 billion. However, the blue-sky target calls for a revenue haul of $13.69 billion. If so, that would make its modest P/S ratio of 0.76X seem reasonable. Plus, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 2.79%.\n\nDine Brands (DIN) din stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWorking in the broad consumer cyclical industry, Dine Brands (NYSE:DIN) \u2013 as you might imagine from the name \u2013 focuses on restaurants. It\u2019s a tricky narrative because of the challenges facing the consumer economy. However, what makes Dine attractive as one of the potential bargain stocks to buy is its ownership of compelling brands like Applebee\u2019s and International House of Pancakes (IHOP).\n\nFundamentally, people need entertainment and it\u2019s unreasonable to assume that they\u2019ll eat at home indefinitely. Further, the revenge travel phenomenon has transitioned to a prioritization of travel. That should benefit Dine because of the relatively low-cost leadership in the industry. DIN is down almost 30% over the past 52 weeks. However, this could be a hidden gem to pick up.\n\nFor one thing, stock price volatility has largely stabilized since November 2023. Also, analysts anticipate as a consensus view modest growth at projected fiscal 2024 sales of $838.3 million. However, the blue-sky target calls for $847.73 million. That makes DIN\u2019s P/S ratio of 0.83X more palatable. While you\u2019re waiting, you can fill your plate with a forward dividend yield of 4.53%.\n\nPolaris (PII) A close-up shot of a Polaris (PII) all terrain vehicle.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the consumer cyclical ecosystem, Polaris (NYSE:PII) operates as a manufacturer of recreational vehicles. Per its public profile, the company conducts business through three segments: Off-Road, On-Road and Marine. Of course, Polaris will be a tricky idea among bargain stocks to buy. With so many challenges in the consumer economy, it may be difficult to justify acquiring PII.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not an impossibly silly idea. Yes, shares are down more than 15% over the past 52 weeks. At $88.08, it\u2019s very close to its low point in the trailing year. Still, the technical argument may be that the worst of the volatility had subsided by the fall of 2023. Fundamentally, the wealth gap has expanded, meaning that Polaris may have a large addressable market.\n\nFor full disclosure, sales projections for fiscal 2024 calls for a 6.1% reduction in the top line compared to 2023. What\u2019s more, the blue-sky revenue target for fiscal 2025 is $8.88 billion, which is still below 2023\u2019s tally of $8.93 billion. However, analysts still rate PII a moderate buy with a $98.38 average price target.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother name in the consumer cyclical space, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is a retailer specializing in branded and private label beauty products. These include cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and myriad other categories. Further, the company offers beauty services, including hair, makeup, brown and skin services at its stores.\n\nOver the long run, one of the big catalysts for ULTA should be social normalization. With people no longer worried about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they\u2019re free to engage with each other. That naturally incentives the beauty care industry. Moreover, the slowing April jobs report indicates that the labor market could become much more competitive (for white-collar positions). This too should indirectly bolster cosmetic sales.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate revenue to hit $11.74 billion. If so, that would imply a 4.8% lift from last year\u2019s haul of $11.98 billion. The following year should see sales of $12.47 billion, up 6.2%. Therefore, while the P/S ratio of 1.79X is somewhat elevated, it\u2019s a relative discount to the 2.31X metric seen just a few months earlier.\n\nSmartRent (SMRT) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWorking in the technology field, SmartRent (NYSE:SMRT) falls under the software application category. Per its corporate profile, SmartRent is an enterprise real-estate tech firm, providing management software and applications to rental property owners and operators. As well, the company serves property managers, home builders, developers and residents. With the boom in real estate sales, SMRT could be a relevant idea for bargain stocks to buy.\n\nIt\u2019s not the easiest case to make, admittedly. Since the January opener, SMRT fell almost 8%. Over the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s down more than 20%. However, on Tuesday, it popped up 18%, possibly signaling a recovery play. Of course, SmartRent is dependent on the health of the broader economy. However, should interest rates decline, it could be an interesting idea.\n\nAnalysts believe that fiscal 2024 revenue will land at $273.38 million. That\u2019s up 15.4% from last year\u2019s result of $236.84 million. In the following year, they\u2019re forecasting consensus sales to hit $325.99 million. If so, that would be a gain of 19.2% from projected 2024 revenue. It\u2019s worth keeping on the radar.\n\nSturm Ruger (RGR) An LCP Custom handgun manufactured by Sturm Ruger (RGR).\n\nSource: Susan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com\n\nA controversial enterprise, Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) is a firearms manufacturer. Obviously, the industry has a poor reputation and it\u2019s not getting any better. With shooting-related crimes soaring, this sector carries a product evangelism dilemma. That said, it would be grossly unfair to overlook the economics of the industry. With so many legally registered firearms in the U.S., Ruger simply enjoys a large addressable market.\n\nBut does that alone make it one of the bargain stocks to buy? Not really \u2013 not unless you consider the politics behind it. Should the Democrats win big in the upcoming election or if there is a rising consensus that they will win big, that could spark a panic. Cynically stated, people may rush to acquire firearms before Democrats attempt to implement draconian gun control measures.\n\nNow, the one analyst that covers RGR believes fiscal 2024 sales could land at $561.23 million. That would be up a modest 3.2% from last year\u2019s result of $543.77 million. Further, fiscal 2025 sales could improve to $583.17 million, up 3.9%.\n\nHowever, these numbers could get a lot bigger if the political winds move in the right (or is that left?) direction.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "High interest rates are here to stay. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the fight against inflation had stalled and the central bank was leaving interest rates unchanged. It wasn\u2019t unexpected but it means that costs will remain elevated for an extended period for business. The Fed will try to slow the economy through its higher-for-longer policies. Although businesses can learn to adjust to the new normal, it takes a toll on their performance and causes stock prices to fall. Investors should be ready.\n\nIt\u2019s not an indication that the businesses are broken, only that the government is inept at managing the economy. Eventually this period will pass and businesses will pick up again, allowing their stocks to rise. By buying shares while they\u2019re down, investors will juice their portfolio returns on the recovery.\n\nBelow are three bargain stocks to buy for just such a scenario.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee shop Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is the perfect example of this in action. It just reported quarterly results that stunned Wall Street with how bad they were. While the chain had been passing along its increased costs to consumers, coffee drinkers pushed back in the fiscal second quarter and decided to pass on the high-priced brew. Sales fell 2% in the period to $8.6 billion. Adjusted profits plunged 14% year over year to 68 cents per share.\n\nStarbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said economic conditions were to blame.\n\n\u201cWe continue to feel the impact of a more cautious consumer,\u201d he told analysts, \u201cparticularly with our more occasional customer, and a deteriorating economic outlook has weighed on customer traffic and impact felt broadly across the industry.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the fault of Starbucks, and as Narasimhan suggested, it\u2019s hurting everyone. McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) also felt the effects of government and Fed policies with an earnings miss.\n\nThat, however, does make Starbucks a bargain stock to buy. Maybe don\u2019t rush right in, but the stock cratered 16% after earnings and is beginning to look much more attractive than it has for some time. As the coffee shop isn\u2019t sure whether it will cut prices to lure customers back, the malaise could linger for the stock. But this is now a discounted company you might want to buy.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nObesity and diabetes often go hand in hand, which is why combating one can help minimize the other. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is making bank with therapies for both, following rival Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) blowing up the market with its celebrity-endorsed treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead of using semaglutide as its glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, Lilly uses terzepatide as the wunderkind in Mounjaro and Zepbound. The treatments were only approved by the Food & Drug Administration last November but are already generating massive results. Worldwide sales of Mounjaro rocketed to $1.8 billion in the first quarter following U.S. approval, versus $565 million last year. Zepbound saw $517 million in sales in its first full quarter after approval.\n\nBut Eli Lilly isn\u2019t a one-trick pony (or two tricks in this instance). It has a portfolio of solid therapies. One of the best performers was Verzenio, a treatment for advanced metastatic breast cancer. Sales surged 40% to $1 billion, driven by increased U.S. demand. But that led to large back orders and Lilly is forecasting tight supplies going forward. How much money it makes will be restricted by how much it can produce.\n\nLimited capacity to meet demand could eventually bite Lilly, which might not be so bad for investors considering the hefty premium Eli Lilly stock carries. Shares go for 116 times trailing earnings, 60 times estimates and 20 times sales. That\u2019s not cheap. Any meaningful pullback in the stock, however, should be an invitation to buy.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwo months ago, I wrote that Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) was primed for a price cut via a stock split. Trading at $554 per share, I said that the beauty and personal care retailer would benefit from the increased liquidity and availability of its stock by splitting them to make them more affordable. Well, investors got a price cut \u2014 but not from any split.\n\nUlta Beauty stock was crushed last month after warning it was seeing a slowdown in sales across the first two months of the quarter. Shares are down 30% from the highs hit shortly after my article published. They recently closed just under $400 a share.\n\nThat makes them much more attractive even if they still trade at triple-digit prices. Ulta is the largest specialty beauty retailer in the U.S., with nearly 1,375 stores in all 50 states. After the haircut, shares trade at just 15 times trailing earnings, 13 times estimates and less than 2 times sales. Ulta also goes for 18 times the free cash flow (FCF) it produces. Closer to 10 times FCF would indicate that Ulta Beauty stock is a bargain-basement steal. But even at these levels, it makes for an attractive stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Barclays Just Slashed Its Price Target on These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Keeping an eye on what Barclays and other large investment banking firms can provide insights into a stock\u2019s market position. These price targets, like any other financial analysis, are predictions that cannot account for the human factors of a corporation, such as quality control, leadership, and productivity. Looking for stocks with lowered price targets helps determine if you\u2019re buying a stock at the right time.\n\nThe saying goes \u201cBuy low, sell high,\u201d making it unwise to buy when analysts say a stock will trend lower. Bearing this in mind, it\u2019s also important to research whether the stock will decline further. Sometimes, both decreases and increases in price targets can be conservative estimates based on broader market trends than what can be accurately predicted.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret (VSCO) Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores. Retail Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Rawpixel.com / Shutterstock\n\nKnown for its sizeable chunk of the premium women\u2019s underwear market, Victoria\u2019s Secret (NASDAQ:VSCO) stock pricing can be difficult to pin down. On one hand, the company is hardly innovative, while on the other, it is a staple of women\u2019s clothing. So why then did Barclays put it amongst its stocks with lowered price targets?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe likely answer is the trend of American consumers spending less in the retail sector which has affected the profit margins of nearly all non-essential retail stores. While VSCO underwear undoubtedly sells well, its pricing has only increased over the years while offering the same standards of comfort and quality. To its credit, VSCO has worked hard to establish a more inclusive brand image, offering a variety of underwear styles.\n\nHowever, since 2019, many shoppers have viewed VSCO\u2019s products as overpriced or too expensive to justify. Fast forward to 2024 and the reality is the same with now inflation eating into consumers\u2019 wallets. Thus, it makes sense why Barclays is estimating this stock\u2019s price will drop.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nBarclays recently lowered its price target for Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) from a high-value estimate of $612 to $434 a share. This means the banking giant still sees a 9.4% upside for ULTA, but not to the extent previously expected. While constricted consumer spending is also likely part of this prediction, ULTA\u2019s plans to expand its stores across the U.S. and into Mexico could factor in as well.\n\nAfter all, expansion projects for any company cut into free cash flow in the short term and limit ability to store cash reserves. With expenditures on the horizon, ULTA\u2019s next earnings report on May 30 might show thinner profit margins, which could impact short-term trading prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, don\u2019t bet against ULTA in the long run, as it has consistently delivered revenue growth even during times of inflation. Moreover, because the brand is not seen as a super-premium or luxury boutique, but rather a general beauty products store, it can adjust its offerings to fit a broad spectrum of spending categories.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nSpeaking of super-premium branding, Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) has also fallen into Barclays\u2019 bin of stocks with lowered price targets. With its original predicted price of $546 per share now down to $395, it seems like inflation is catching up to LULU\u2019s prospects as well. Much like VSCO, Lululemon has been able to charge premium prices for simple products like leggings due to extensive brand recognition and celebrity endorsement.\n\nThis ultimately created a devoted following of consumers who believe a $130 pair of workout pants is worth it. However, as individual spending power decreases and necessities like food and housing go up in price, the hype around workout clothes starts to feel irrelevant. While the company saw strong revenue growth in Q4 2023, coming in at 16% year-over-year, that trend will likely slow in the coming months.\n\nPerhaps those long-awaited interest rate cuts will abate a consumer spending slowdown, but for now, money is getting scarcer for the U.S. middle class.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "The S&P 500 is headed higher once again, but in April, the index lost roughly 4% of its value. Nearly every sector experienced weakness, erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in value.\n\nIf you've been searching for bargains, the following three stocks might be your ticket.\n\nWarren Buffett just made a move in this underperformer\n\nThe worst performer in the S&P 500 this April was Globe Life(NYSE: GL). This stock lost nearly 35% of its value last month. In fact, shares lost half of their value in a single day, although the share price has recovered a bit since.\n\nWhat happened? Fuzzy Panda Research, a short-seller, accused the insurer of \"extensive\" and \"obvious\" fraud. This report came on top of various legal claims against several of the company's subsidiaries -- American Income Life Insurance Co. and Arias Agencies -- including accusations of rampant drug use and sexual abuse. Investment firm Evercore believes shares now have \"significant uncertainty.\" There's so much uncertainty, in fact, that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathawayrecently sold its stake in the company.\n\nIs Globe Life stock on sale? Yes, at least according to its previous trading levels. But there's just too much uncertainty here to make an informed bet. While catching a falling knife can be enticing, it's likely best to follow in Buffett's footsteps and avoid this complicated stock. ^SPXTR Chart\n\nThis iconic stock is priced right for value investors\n\nThe second-worst performer in the S&P 500 last month is an iconic business: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). In April, Intel stock shed nearly one-third of its value.\n\nThis isn't Intel's first bad month. Over the last three years, the company has lost nearly half of its total value. The issues are many. Revenue levels have been falling, its share of the chip market has been shrinking, and last month the stock nosedived after management released weak guidance for the quarter ahead.\n\nHas April's slide made Intel worth looking into? Fool writer Dani Cook thinks so. The company isn't without its problems, but shares are attractively priced versus competitors like AMD and Nvidia. \"[S]hares are potentially the best-valued option in the chip market,\" she says, and adds: \"As a result, anyone looking to add a chip stock to their portfolio would probably do well to make a long-term investment in Intel now while they wait for Nvidia and AMD to come down to a more attractive price point.\" NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nWall Street thinks this 1 stock is a buy\n\nThe final stock on this list is Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA), which lost around 23% of its value last month. This is not the company's first time experiencing extreme monthly swings. Over the past six months, shares have zoomed from $400 to nearly $600, only to give up the gains entirely.\n\nStory continues\n\nUlta's struggles mirror those of Intel. Namely, it's facing a slowdown in sales, with management issuing weaker-than-expected guidance. The company's CEO, David Kimbell, couldn't pinpoint an exact reason for the sales slowdown. Rather, he pointed to weakness in the consumer discretionary sector in general.\n\n\"Despite the downbeat commentary,\" Fool writer Jeremy Bowman explains, \"several analysts reaffirmed buy ratings on Ulta stock, showing that Wall Street believes the headwinds are just short term.\" The last time Ulta stock reached the $400 level, shares popped in value by nearly 50% over a handful of months. If you've been looking for market bargains, Ulta is a great stock to dig deeper into.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE:WSM), founded by Chuck Williams in 1956 and publicly traded since 1983, is an omni-channel specialty retailer offering a diverse range of cooking, dining and entertainment products, as well as home furnishings and decorative accessories.\n\nI became interested in this stock in early 2023. At that time, shares were trading at $130, had a low price-earnings ratio of under 8, free cash flow of nearly $700 million and extremely robust return metrics, including a return on invested capital of 34.05%, a return on equity of 66.31% and a return on assets of 25.42%. Since then, the stock has jumped to a peak of $317.53 on March 28 and has drifted down slightly to $287.82 at the time of writing. GuruFocus assesses shares as being significantly overvalued; however, the stock is still garnering rave reviews by analysts and the press and is estimated to have a free cash flow margin of safety of 59.71%. This analysis aims to discuss the stock, its relative position compared to five closely aligned competitors and whether the stock warrants the enthusiasm that surrounds it or if value investors should think about scaling back.\n\nIndustry overview and competitive landscape\n\nGuruFocus categorizes Williams-Sonoma as belonging to the consumer cyclical sector, the retail cyclical industry and the retail specialty subindustry. These subindustries compare the retailer to other companies that offer an array of products and services, including automotive parts (Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC)), electronics (Best Buy (BBY)), sporting goods (Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS)), beauty (Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA)) and personal care products (Bath & Body Works (NYSE:BBWI)), farm products (Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO)) and convenience stores (Casey's General Stores (NASDAQ:CASY)). I assessed this subcategory as still too broad, so I've narrowed it to include just retail specialty businesses that are focused on hardlines and home furnishings. These highly competitive subindustries encompass the manufacture, distribution and retail of various products related to home decor and functionality, including furniture, household decorative accessories, appliances, cookware and gardening equipment, and are part of the greater specialty e-commerce and retail business space which has shifted more toward e-commerce and intensified competition from both emerging internet and discount retailers as well as established companies.\n\nFactors that determine the success of companies in this space include responsiveness to changing consumer demands and preferences, brand recognition, price competitiveness, cost management, effective promotional strategies and marketing, innovative shopping experiences (mobile applications, augmented reality capabilities, user-friendly shopping carts and check out, etc.) smartly leveraged artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance the customer experience and streamline processes, product quality that appeals to a diverse set of consumers, product differentiation and supply chain and distribution management.\n\nStory continues\n\nProduct sales closely parallel those within the housing market, especially within the market for existing homes, which has seen constraints in the last year as current homeowners have been commonly locked into their low mortgage rates, preventing them from relocating. This will likely continue throughout 2024, but may ease in the last quarter with reports of the Federal Reserve possibly easing or reducing rates in the latter part of the year. The housing market is only expected to grow at an average annual rate of between 3% to 5% until 2030.\n\nI came up with a list of five competitors that occupy those categories: Wayfair (NYSE:W), Beyond Inc. (NYSE:BYON), RH (NYSE:RH), Ethan Allen Designs (NYSE:ETD) and TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). These companies have market capitalizations ranging in size from $718 million (Ethan Allen Interiors) to $107 billion (TJX Companies). Since TJX Companies is a holding company primarily focused on apparel, I have focused mainly on the portion of its business dedicated to the HomeGoods/HomeSense operating segment, which is involved in the home furnishings industry, in this study. Williams-Sonoma has a market capitalization of $18.43 billion. Three peers (RH, Ethan Allen Designs and HomeGoods) are traditional brick-and-mortar businesses that have expanded their omnichannel networks to include e-commerce, while Wayfair and Beyond are primarily asset-light internet businesses, although Wayfair does have four retail outlet locations. The charts below depict market distributions by capitalization and revenue: Value Propositions of Williams-Sonoma and Its Peers Value Propositions of Williams-Sonoma and Its Peers\n\nValue evaluation based on CAPE and PE ratios\n\nTo assess value propositions in this sector, I compared the Shiller PE or CAPE ratio against the regular price-earnings ratio of the consumer cyclical sector versus those of other sectors. As of April 29, the CAPE ratio of the consumer cyclical sector was 45.30 versus a regular price-earnings ratio of 29.20. Thus, the CAPE ratio exceeds the price-earnings ratio by 43%. In contrast, the basic materials sector's CAPE ratio was 28.60 and its price-earnings ratio was 30.10, reflecting a PE ratio that exceeds the CAPE ratio by 5.11%. A CAPE ratio that exceeds the regular price-earnings ratio suggests the sector may be overvalued, thus basic material companies may be a better option for investors than consumer cyclical companies. However, basic materials are characterized by commodity pricing with little differentiation between competitors, while higher prices for companies in the consumer cyclical sector may be warranted if they have significant moats.\n\nThe retail cyclical industry has a median CAPE ratio of 17.135 (based on 560 companies) versus a median price-earnings ratio of 17.95 (based on 752 companies) representing a much narrower margin (4.65%) than that of the consumer cyclical sector. Williams-Somona's CAPE ratio is 33.66 versus a median price-earnings ratio of 19.84, representing an even larger gap (52.32%) between the excessive CAPE ratio and the PE ratio as compared to the sector. Williams-Sonoma is overvalued, as shown in the table below, based on the GF Value of $155.79; however, strong investor sentiment has been based on the company's strong free cash flow and fundamentals.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma's competitive advantages with those of its peers\n\nBranding\n\nWilliams-Sonoma uses its focused brand strategy as the basis of its business operating segments. The long-running Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn brands are easily recognizable, often a trait of brick-and-mortar businesses as compared to asset-light internet companies. However, TJX's HomeGoods brand, originally launched in 1992, is also very well entrenched in the minds of consumers.\n\nIntensive competition has muted these brands somewhat, and a review of other Williams-Sonoma brands compared to its five peers yields no significant difference. Most of these companies organize their brands into collections. Williams-Sonoma launched Pottery Barn Kids in 1999 and Pottery Barn Teen in 2009 to appeal to the market for children, but these efforts were duplicated by RH, which launched a baby and child's line in 2008 and a teen line sometime later. Furthermore, Beyond, whose branding strategy includes acquiring assets of now-defunct companies like Bed, Bath and Beyond and Zulily to beef up recognition is planning to launch its baby, child and teen lines later this year.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma has accumulated data from a long history of wedding and baby registries; however, the nature of product offerings with extreme price sensitivity and absence of switching costs has contributed very little advantage from a customer loyalty perspective. The only product offering advantage the company has in this competitive playing field is that its oldest business is focused on cookware and small appliances, which have more resiliency during business cycles than furnishings and other retail goods.\n\nFrom a branding perspective, Williams-Sonoma's prior advantage has diminished as nimble competitors refine their marketing strategies and algorithms.\n\nCapital allocation and return metrics\n\nCompared to the other five companies in this playing field, Williams-Sonoma has the best returns on assets, invested capital and capital employed. Furthermore, of all six companies, it leads the pack for free cash flow margin. The ability to have good cash flow often excites investors.\n\nIn observing Williams-Sonoma's profitability and return metrics versus those of its peers, Wayfair and Beyond have spotty histories of profitability over 10 years, and currently have dreadfully unfavorable return metrics. The other three predominantly brick-and-mortar companies have comparable return metrics that either match or exceed those of Williams-Sonoma. Ethan Allen Designs' gross margin exceeds that of Williams-Sonoma by over 20%. A contributing factor to its high gross margin may be its active pursuit of franchises through its Independent Retailer program. Franchise operations also comprise approximately 21% of Williams-Sonoma's global store fleet. Franchise business models efficiently contribute to growth margins in that franchisers can expand global footprints while outsourcing daily operational costs to franchisees, keeping costs of expansion relatively light.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma's operating and net margins also lead the pack, indicating effective deployment of capital. RH's ROE is over 35% higher and TJX's ROE is over 12% higher than that of Williams-Sonoma.\n\nCompany Williams Sonoma Wayfair Beyond, Inc. RH Ethan Allen Designs TJX Profitability Rank 9 3 3 8 7 9 Gross Margin % 42.62 30.55 20.11 45.86 61.02 30 Operating Margin % 16.05 -6.12 -7.57 12.09 13.01 10.69 Net Margin % 12.25 -6.15 -19.72 4.21 10.63 8.25 FCF Margin % 19.25 -0.02 -4.07 -2.22 10.45 8 ROE % 54.4 NA -56.28 89.98 15.13 66.72 ROA % 19.9 -21.7 -38.64 2.75 9.58 15.32 ROIC % 27.32 -31.35 -29.25 8.57 11.79 22.53 ROCE % 40.95 -51.79 -44.85 10.76 16.29 32.57 Profitability over the Past 10 years 10 1 5 9 10 10\n\nSupply chain and distribution channels\n\nWilliams-Sonoma's long history of operations and data accumulation has also helped the company with advantages over those of its peers concerning supply chains, distribution networks and store fleet productivity. These channels have been honed by its long-running history of former catalog sales that has morphed into an omnichannel distribution network with two-thirds of sales from its e-commerce channel, minimizing expenses and maximizing margins. The company has become more focused on the business-to-business marketplace, further enhancing profit margins over that of its traditional brick-and-mortar business. TJX, which also has well-engrained operating and data accumulation histories, has also honed effective supply chain strategies, in part, due to their focus on apparel. TJX buys apparel from major retailers in the off-season at marked down prices, then turns around and sells it the following season for a profit. As TJX is primarily a discount retailer, it has not developed a business-to-business marketplace channel. Neither has Beyond, which other than its Overstock.com business is primarily in the development stages. But the remaining three competitors have. Ethan Allen Designs has a significant focus on wholesale operations, which is considered one of its two operating segments (the other being retail.) Wholesale operations comprise approximately 41% of sales. The company has a website page that targets interior designers, contractors, office planners and accommodations, a Trade page that offers incentives for professionals who use Ethan Allen products for their designs and an affiliate program. Wayfair and RH have branded channels called Wayfair Professional and RH Trade respectively.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince I started writing this piece, investor sentiment has cooled somewhat on Williams-Sonoma. Indeed, insider transactions reveal a selling trend. Although the company has had a historically consistent record of generating cash, a review of the CAPE ratio, additional metrics and its differentiation indicate little advantage over peer companies. For those reasons, investors may want to pursue a conservative strategy when addressing this investment.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

Some of these dips only last a few days, while others can extend for several months. When great stocks go on sale, investors can accumulate more shares with the same amount of capital.\n\nThese bargain deals don\u2019t last forever, as investors soon remember the long-term growth prospects of stocks on the discount rack.

Some investors wanted more, but the company delivered good earnings and only trades at a 25.9 P/E ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRevenue increased by 27% year-over-year (YoY), while net income surged by 117% YoY. Daily active users grew 7% YoY to reach 3.24 billion users among its platforms. Meta Platforms also stands to benefit if the TikTok ban goes through.\n\nThe deadline is January 19, 2025, one day before the next presidential inauguration. ByteDance stated it will not sell TikTok. The app reached 150 million American users in March 2023. It\u2019s very safe to assume the number has soared since then.

Investors were spooked over a warning from Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) about softening demand for its beauty products.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty has been growing at a faster rate than Ulta.

The athletic apparel giant is up 25% year-to-date and has soared by 431% over the past five years. Despite the long-term gains, Deckers Outdoor is in the middle of a correction.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) has had a rough month with its share price down 24%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Ulta Beauty's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ulta Beauty is:\n\n57% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$2.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.57 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nUlta Beauty's Earnings Growth And 57% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Ulta Beauty has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Ulta Beauty's considerable five year net income growth of 22% was to be expected.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Ulta Beauty's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 25% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is ULTA worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether ULTA is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Ulta Beauty Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nUlta Beauty doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Ulta Beauty's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

As the largest beauty retailer in the U.S., we have the power to help shape how young people experience beauty and a responsibility to ensure women and teens have access to the resources and support they need to nurture their holistic well-being inside and out.\"\n\nTo advance its well-being efforts, the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation is launching a national fundraising campaign across its stores benefitting Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) and donating more than $1 million in 2024 to national nonprofit partners focused on well-being, including The Jed Foundation, Active Minds and Girls Inc. To reach all communities including BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities, the foundation is also donating $2 million to nonprofit partners that focus on well-being efforts specific to these communities. The Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation will also continue its longstanding support for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) through monetary and in-kind donations, and an in-store fundraising program.\n\nNew and Expanded Nonprofit Partnerships in 2024 Focused on Well-Being\n\nThe Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation is expanding its relationship with Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) to become its national well-being partner and is launching a national point-of-sale donation campaign to bring mental health resources to youth across the country. From May 19 through June 15, guests will have the opportunity to donate to BBBS in Ulta Beauty stores. The donations will be used to help activate Youth Discovery & Wellness resources in 2024, which will reach children and teens (\"Littles\") in the program with resources for self-care, self-expression, and self-discovery. To kick off the partnership, Ulta Beauty associates packed 2,000 heath & wellness kits at the company\u2019s Field Leadership Conference in April, which will be distributed to BBBS Littles.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We are thrilled to partner with the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation to create more youth-focused wellness initiatives that promote self-care, self-expression and self-discovery,\" said Big Brothers Big Sisters of America President and CEO, Artis Stevens. \"In a time where the mental health challenges young people face are increasingly complex, mentorship has proven to be an important part of their overall well-being by helping them reach their potential and lead fulfilling lives. Our approach, which puts youth at the center, relies on the support of communities working together, and partnerships like this one to create a better world through the power of mentorship.\"\n\nThe Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation is issuing $1 million in grants to national nonprofit partners focused on mental health and holistic well-being.\n\nThe Jed Foundation: The foundation\u2019s grant will bring the organization\u2019s evidence-based mental health and suicide prevention model to 3-4 local community-based youth-serving organizations in 2024-2025. Active Minds: The foundation\u2019s grant will expand Active Minds\u2019 youth-led mental health programs to 300 new schools through a comprehensive high school curriculum, an online mental health resource hub, and leadership development initiatives, aiming to empower students as mental health champions and foster inclusive communities nationwide. Girls Inc. The foundation\u2019s grant will support the organization\u2019s Mind + Body Toolkit \u2013 a programming resource delivering holistic wellness tools engaging girls around the topics of mental health, confidence, and healthy living.\n\nEnhancing Well-Being Among Ulta Beauty Associates\n\nUlta Beauty is committed to offering company associates year-round support and resources to enhance their well-being and opportunities for success, including financial wellness planning and guidance resources, annual memberships to a meditation tool and training on wellness, mindfulness, and inclusion.\n\nUlta Beauty believes that giving back has a significant impact on associate engagement and connectedness. The Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation offers year-round volunteer opportunities for associates who are passionate about giving back to their communities. These opportunities enable Ulta Beauty associates to engage with nonprofit partners and lend expertise, mentoring and support to women and teens based on local needs.\n\nBeyond giving back to the communities we serve, the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation offers an Associate Relief Fund, to ensure Ulta Beauty associates have access to financial support in times of need.

        "title": "12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 under the radar stocks with massive upside for 2024. If you want to skip our overview of shareholder ownership and how shares can jump if they come 'over' the radar instead of under, then you can jump ahead to 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024.\n\nInvesting in stocks is quite different these days compared to even just a decade back. Broadband internet combined with the rapid boom in personal computing devices, digital banking, and financial technology services allows anyone willing to take the risk to try their hand at stocks. This democratization of the stock market means that as opposed to the Wall Street of the 2000s and the 1990s, now, anyone can set their trading setup, consume information, and see how fate plays out on the S&P 500.\n\nAt the same time, while there are more avenues of trading available, the number of equities that are available for trading also runs in the thousands. For our everyday retail trader, this means that some stocks will always be under the radar as sifting out small and little known companies that might be the next Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might remain out of the spotlight for retail traders. Professional investors such as hedge funds benefit from their significant computing, financial, and human resources which enable them to go through countless firms each day to see which might be poised for growth.\n\nAs a result of all this, and other factors such as management decisions, stocks can also be bifurcated along their ownership structure. Some stocks, such as the mining giant BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) or the American depository receipts of the well known Japanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) are well known among retail investors and also have a large portion of their share ownership represented by them. Data from Refinitiv shows that for BHP, institutional and insider investors own 3.84% of the total shares outstanding, while for Toyota this percentage drops down to just 1.51%. This is unsurprising given that not only do these firms have billions of shares outstanding, but also since they are global brands.\n\nOther stocks are remarkable for their significant institutional and insider ownership. For instance, the software giant Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) has 157.36 million shares outstanding and 155.6 million shares as its float. Despite this, 92% of its stock is held by institutions, ensuring that even if the stock generates substantial hype, it will nevertheless remain under the radar as large numbers of retail investors will remain unable to add the stock to their portfolios and monitor it over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, investing in under the radar stocks can also be quite lucrative. After all, rapid share price appreciations are often driven by a large number of people feeling confident about a stock's future and starting to buy the shares. Perhaps the best example of this and one that's relevant to our discussion of Wall Street's democratization is the stock of the well known video game retailer GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME). Part of the meme stock craze that briefly took over the stock market, GameStop's shares soared in triple digit percentages in the blink of an eye as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the stock in bulk. This also led to massive losses for hedge funds which had sold the shares short based on the firm's fundamentals, and for a brief time period, it appeared that Wall Street had permanently changed.\n\nSo, which stocks are currently under the radar and are seeing significant upside from analysts? We took a look, with some top picks being Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA). 12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best under the radar stocks with significant upside we first made a list of under the radar stocks by sifting through coverage in the financial media. Then, the top 20 stocks with the highest analyst average share price target upside were narrowed down. Finally, these were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023, and the best under the radar stocks were picked.\n\nFor these top under the radar stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024\n\n12.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Finding compelling growth stocks isn't a terribly difficult task in the modern market environment. They're often staring you right in the face.\n\nShopping for growth stocks you can buy and hold forever, however, is a different story. Their underlying companies should be industry leaders capable of adapting as needed. And the industries they're in should be ones that will always be in demand. Just ask Kodak, Blockbuster, and Tower Records.\n\nHere's a rundown of three growth picks you can feel good about buying now and sitting on indefinitely.\n\n1. Ulta Beauty\n\nTo be fair, Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans made a valid observation when downgradingUlta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) to a hold recently. The beauty retailer truly is facing a \"lack of newness and increasing pressure from Sephora\" at this time.\n\nThere are a couple of matters the downgrade looks right past, however.\n\nThe first of these is that while the beauty business (skincare, haircare, cosmetics, fragrance, etc.) may be highly competitive, it's also a business that perpetually lends itself to new brands and products. Although Ulta's recent additions of Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro brands aren't making a significant impact -- at least not yet -- remixing its product lineup is nothing new to Ulta. Patience will pay.\n\nAnd the other overlooked factor working in Ulta Beauty's favor? While its recent earnings reports have been ho-hum and revenue guidance for the remainder of the current fiscal year is lackluster, that isn't an indictment of the company. It's a symptom of the current economic environment. Spending on must-have consumer staples is up due to inflation, putting pressure on discretionary spending including on beauty goods. The recent Wall Street Journal headline (specifically regarding Ulta) \"Beauty Slowdown Reflects Cracks in Consumer Spending\" speaks volumes.\n\nAll economic headwinds are cyclical, though. The economy will work its way back to full health sooner or later, and likely sooner than later. Once that happens, look for discretionary spending on things like makeup and haircare to bounce back with it.\n\nThe kicker: Ulta Beauty's operation meets consumers increasingly where they want to be. That's not so much the mall anymore. Rather, it's their neighborhood, and online in particular. Younger, digitally native consumers care less about where they buy their goods. They care far more about value and convenience, allowing Ulta to leverage its surprisingly strong e-commerce operation and membership/rewards program. In this vein, member utilization of its shopping app was up 30% last quarter. The retailer's also making investments in tech that will better personalize the online shopping experience, which should ultimately drive more member purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's just going to take some time for all of this to come together.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has become such a frequently suggested stock pick that it's almost become clich\u00e9. Amazon is of course one of the planet's biggest e-commerce platforms (and certainly the biggest in the western half of the world). Yet, it still only controls a little more than one-third of the United States' e-commerce market, and even less outside of the U.S. It's also a huge cloud computing service provider. Synergy Research Group reports Amazon's share of the cloud computing leads the way at 31% of the industry's worldwide revenue.\n\nConnect the dots. There's still plenty of room ahead for growth.\n\nThe reason Amazon is a true forever name, however, are the evolutions it's going through right now.\n\nA rethinking of how to best monetize online shopping is one of these evolutions. In its infancy the company's core business was simply selling goods online. Then it got serious about third-party sellers. Now it's turning up the heat on its retail media business, charging sellers to prominently feature their goods at Amazon.com. This may be Amazon's most lucrative, highest-margin business yet, which was worth $47 billion last year alone.\n\nAnother bigger-picture evolution is an effort to improve the appeal of cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services.\n\nWhile it may be the world's single busiest cloud services company, Amazon Web Services' lack of recent revenue growth is stark. Would-be cloud customers are finding providers like Microsoft and Alphabet are better equipped to meet their needs, particularly as it pertains to artificial intelligence.\n\nAmazon is upping its game, though. Just this week the company unveiled several new features for its generative AI platform called Bedrock. And, earlier this year the company acquired a data center directly connected to a nuclear power plant, recognizing the amount of electricity needed to support artificial intelligence platforms is so enormous that it could prove restrictive.\n\nSome of these initiatives will pay off sooner than others. All of them underscore the sort of long-term holistic thinking Amazon is doing.\n\n3. Nike\n\nLast but not least, add Nike(NYSE: NKE) to your list of growth stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nIt's been a tough past couple of years for Nike. Although the company's decision to rely less on retail partners and focus more on home-grown revenue makes sense, the shift isn't proving easy. As it turns out, struggling athletic apparel and footwear store chains like Foot Locker are still go-to destinations for consumers.\n\nAt the same time, the powerhouse sports apparel brand is learning just how tough it is to scale up your own direct-selling operation with or without an online presence. Last quarter's overall revenue was flat year over year, while Nike's digital sales -- a frequent bright spot in the company's recent quarterly reports -- only improved a modest 4% during the three-month stretch ending in February.\n\nThen there's the simple fact that younger consumers are more willing to try out new brands, like On Holdings.\n\nEnd result? Revenue growth for Nike has been hit-and-miss. Ditto for earnings. That's the big reason Nike stock is down by nearly half of its late-2021 peak price.\n\nThere's a detail too many investors are forgetting here, though. Recent challenges aside, this is Nike. It remains the world's single-biggest and best-known athletic wear brand, and it downright dominates the athletic footwear arena with a market share of 62%, according to numbers from IBISWorld. Nike might be on the defensive now, but it's got plenty of tools and name recognition to work with.\n\nThere's plenty of reason to expect such a turnaround of sorts in the near future, too.\n\nAt the same time he acknowledged last month that the company pushed too aggressively to wean itself from retail partners, CEO John Donahoe added that Nike hasn't been innovating enough of late. Perhaps feeling a little added pressure from shareholders and during board meetings, Donahoe may be about to light a fresh fire under the company's business starting with this coming summer's Olympics. It's a high-profile catalyst to be sure.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this beauty products retailer have returned -20.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, which Ulta falls in, has lost 8.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nUlta is expected to post earnings of $6.26 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.55 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2%. This estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.22 indicates a change of +10.1% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ulta.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Ulta, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.82 billion and $12.56 billion estimates indicate +5.5% and +6.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nUlta reported revenues of $3.55 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $8.08 for the same period compares with $6.68 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +7.88%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nUlta is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Beauty Stocks to Buy on Ulta\u2019s Guidance Warning",
        "content": "Cosmetic retail firm Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) recently delivered quite the shocker when its CEO said that beauty demand was slowing \u201ca bit earlier and a bit bigger than we thought.\u201d Undoubtedly, the commentary sent shares of ULTA nosediving by around 15%. At writing, ULTA stock has shed more than a quarter of its value from its peak levels. The Ultra guidance warning shockwave swept through the broader beauty industry, with some high-flying beauty stocks also taking sizeable hits to the chin, falling in sympathy with the $20 billion beauty titan.\n\nUndoubtedly, some of the beauty stocks have enjoyed sizeable runs in recent years, and with that, it\u2019s hard not to imagine the expectations bar creeping higher. With such extended valuations amid the market rally, it\u2019s not a mystery why Ulta\u2019s perception of the industry has weighed so heavily on the broader basket of beauty plays.\n\nThe big question is whether a shift in industry trends is solely to blame or if Ulta is being bettered by its rivals. Let\u2019s check in on three beauty stocks that may be worth buying on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF)\n\nSource: elf Cosmetics\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NASDAQ:ELF) has been the most exciting beauty stock to hang onto in recent years. Even after the latest 25% spill, ELF stock is still up 64% over the past year and over 500% in the past two years. Of course, there have been occasional scares en route to higher levels. Last August, the stock lost a third of its value before recovering in record time to hit new highs.\n\nEven as the beauty industry stalls, there\u2019s no doubt that e.l.f. Beauty has been a colossal market share taker, and the company can continue gaining share. Even as the cosmetics market hits a few road bumps, I\u2019d argue, e.l.f. Beauty may be in an even better spot to take more share as consumers seek to spend less.\n\nThe $8.7 billion cosmetics retailer offers competitive prices, decent quality, and, perhaps most importantly, a high degree of innovation. TD Cowen analysts remain upbeat on ELF stock amid recent turbulence, also remarking on the firm\u2019s ability to innovate. I think they\u2019re smart to stay bullish on the name.\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al (LRLCF) A photograph of a L'Or\u00e9al retail storefront.\n\nSource: PippiLongstocking / Shutterstock.com\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al (OTCMKTS:LRLCF) stock spiked higher following the release of some pretty impressive first-quarter earnings results. Most of its product categories saw impressive strength across the board. Most notably, the company\u2019s Dermatological Beauty segment experiences almost 22% gains for the quarter. There seem to be few, if any, signs of beauty industry softness, according to L\u2019Or\u00e9al thus far.\n\nStory continues\n\nPersonally, I think the recent weakness from Ulta is more of a company-specific matter than an industry one. Either way, I expect the broader basket of beauty stocks could grow L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s fantastic number as they rise from oversold conditions.\n\nAs for LRLCF stock itself, it\u2019s less than 7% from all-time highs, which may very well be reached following its applaud-worthy numbers, which, I believe, should act as a breath of fresh air for the broader cosmetics industry.\n\nCoty (COTY) The Coty (COTY) logo on a glass office in Poland.\n\nSource: Konektus Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Coty (NYSE:COTY), which I view as one of the best value options for the beauty market, with shares currently trading at 19.6 times forward price-to-earnings. Apart from the modest multiple, Coty has been praised by several big-name analysts in recent weeks.\n\nTD Cowen upgraded its rating on COTY stock to outperform with a 23% price target hike. As a part of the upgrade, analysts pointed to the firm\u2019s fragrance business as a \u201crobust category in the U.S.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, the luxury fragrance market has been a big mood booster during the pandemic and now through rampant inflation. Many young consumers, like those in the Gen Z cohort, view fragrances as another means of expressing their unique personalities with signature scents (or even sizeable fragrance collections). Further, widely followed social-media influencers within the scent community, like Jeremy Fragrance, have been an absolute boon to the smell-good industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Spotting Winners: Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) And Specialty Retail Stocks In Q4\n\nAs the Q4 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the specialty retail industry, including Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) and its peers.\n\nSome retailers try to sell everything under the sun, while others\u2014appropriately called Specialty Retailers\u2014focus on selling a narrow category and aiming to be exceptional at it. Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it. E-commerce competition exists and waning retail foot traffic impacts these retailers, but the magnitude of the headwinds depends on what they sell and what extra value they provide in their stores.\n\nThe 9 specialty retail stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues missed analyst consensus estimates by 1%. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, though the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and specialty retail stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 11.1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nUlta (NASDAQ:ULTA)\n\nOffering high-end prestige brands as well as lower-priced, mass-market ones, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an American retailer that sells makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products.\n\nUlta reported revenues of $3.55 billion, up 10.2% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company:\u00a0Ulta beat analysts' same store sales, revenue, and gross margin expectations. On the other hand, while full year revenue guidance was roughly in line, its full-year earnings forecast was underwhelming and missed. Ulta Total Revenue\n\nUlta achieved the fastest revenue growth and highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. The stock is down 26.9% since the results and currently trades at $413.5.\n\nIs now the time to buy Ulta?

It was a strong quarter for the company, with a solid beat of analysts' revenue estimates and optimistic earnings guidance for the full year.\n\nStory continues Dick's Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 3.8% since the results and currently trades at $195.08.\n\nIs now the time to buy Dick's?

        "content": "Ulta stock (ULTA) has been in a downward spiral after comments by the beauty retailer's CEO at a JPMorgan retail conference caught investors off guard.\n\nSince April 2, shares have been off by more than18% after CEO Dave Kimbell warned of \"a slowdown in the total category across price points and segments.\"\n\nFormer LVMH chair Pauline Brown interpreted Kimbell's comments differently from nervous investors.\n\n\"I think it's just ... a bit of normalization,\" Brown told Yahoo Finance. \"In general, in discretionary categories, luxury as well as more mass-market beauty, there's a normalizing.\n\n\"There was a bit of frothiness for a while,\" Brown continued, \"and I think when he came out and said, 'We're seeing some slowdown,' he wasn't suggesting there's inflationary pressure or that there's a big hiccup in the consumer market. He was just suggesting that some of the things they've experienced coming right out of COVID and some of the hyped-up activity in beauty and other segments had cooled off.\"\n\nAt the time, Loop Capital Markets managing director Anthony Chukumba said he was \"a little surprised\" by the warning, especially since it came less than three weeks after the company issued its guidance for the year.\n\nIn March, the beauty giant reported fourth quarter results that topped analyst estimates; however, its 2024 earnings guidance came in lighter than expected. Still, Ulta's Kimbell noted on the earnings call that the company remained \"optimistic about the resiliency of the beauty category\" despite the \"dynamic\" macroeconomic environment.\n\n\"I think it's really too early to tell if this is just a little bit of air pocket in terms of demand or if this is kind of the canary in the coal mine,\" Chukumba told Yahoo Finance on April 3.\n\nMexico expansion 'a coup for Ulta'\n\nAnalysts noted that Ulta is lapping tough growth comparisons following a post-pandemic boom in the beauty industry.\n\n\"They have been coming from highs in the past few years, and they've been able to comp the costs, but they have very tough comparisons,\" Jane Hali & Associates senior research analyst Jessica Ram\u00edrez told Yahoo Finance. \"[Kimbell] talked about still a conscious consumer and there being difficulty, which is true, and I think we're seeing that across the board. Now, I think it is still a cautious view.\"\n\nIn an effort to widen its consumer base and compete with cosmetic giants like LVMH-owned Sephora (LVMUY), Ulta has decided to push further into luxury beauty, becoming home to Chanel, Dior, Hourglass, and Fenty Beauty. The company also announced in March that it would be opening stores in Mexico through a joint venture with global operator Axo.\n\nStory continues Cashier Druhan Parker, right, works behind a plexiglass shield Thursday, Nov. 19, 2020, as he checks out shoppers Cassie Howard, center, and Paris Black at an Ulta beauty store on Chicago's Magnificent Mile. Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"That's definitely a market,\" Ramirez said. \"Sephora is there, so [Ulta is] going after its competitor. They do have the beauty that it is entry-level, ... so I think that's still a positive for them.\"\n\nThe overall Latino base could be key for Ulta. According to Nielsen IQ's Hispanic Beauty Consumer Report, Hispanic/Latino consumers outspend their non-Hispanic/Latino counterparts in categories like hair care, cosmetics and nail care, facial skin care, and fragrances. And they're more likely to shop for these products at stores like Ulta, Sephora, Walmart, and Target.\n\nBrown praised the international expansion, describing Mexico as a \"culture and creative sector on fire.\"\n\n\"It's a very, very strong market right now,\" she said. \"It's not evenly distributed, as you would expect in a less developed country. But there's a lot of momentum and a lot of excitement and a lot of kind of advancement going on. And see, even before that momentum I just described, it's always been a captive beauty market. And I do think as the Mexican consumer gets more sophisticated, they're not just one wanting to buy in their sort of local supermarket. So I think it's going to be a coup for Ulta.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

These stocks are more vulnerable to price swings due to macroeconomic factors. These growth stocks to buy now are also held under the microscope each time they report earnings.\n\nInvestors pay more attention to these types of stocks because of the potential payoff. Some growth stocks have become giants within their respective industries while others have the potential to become giants.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why investors buy growth stocks. They want to outperform the stock market. These seven growth stocks to buy now can give you a chance at achieving that objective.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

The company processes more than 4,000 product sales every minute.\n\nThe e-commerce segment is Amazon\u2019s main revenue driver, but the company is also seeing plenty of success with its leading cloud computing division. Amazon Web Services has the\u00a0lion\u2019s share of the cloud computing industry. It has roughly one-third of the total market share and has a big lead over the competition. It\u2019s mostly a duopoly between Amazon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as an honorable mention.\n\nThe tech giant is also expanding its advertising, video streaming, and grocery segments. Amazon recently got accused of\u00a0attempting to steal Trader Joe\u2019s trade secrets. This isn\u2019t the best look for Amazon, but investors should take note that the company is looking to expand its grocery store footprint through Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. Advertising and streaming are the bigger segments to monitor, but Amazon seems to be putting more effort into its grocery segment. This makes it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nSofi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nTraditional bank stocks aren\u2019t considered growth stocks. Those corporations have matured and offer dividend payouts to keep shareholders invested. However, SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) isn\u2019t your traditional bank.\n\nThe fintech company operates entirely online, so you can\u2019t drive to a local branch. The company also has many of the\u00a0financial products you would expect from a big institution. Consumers can get personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, and other products. SoFi has also made great strides in getting mainstream appeal through SoFi Stadium and by becoming the official bank of the NBA.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi reported its first profitable quarter in\u00a0Q4 2023. Net income came to $47.9 million while revenue was $615.4 million. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year and the company ended up with a 7.9% net profit margin. This helps make it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nSoFi\u2019s P/E ratio can drop quickly and present value to patient investors. However, you will have to contend with a stock that has dropped by 31% over the past five years and is also down by 25% year-to-date. Rising profits can catch a lot of investors by surprise and potentially result in a surge.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is gaining market share in the beauty industry and has generated significant returns for investors. The stock is up by 83% over the past year and has surged by 1,200% over the past five years.\n\nThe stock trades at a 73 P/E ratio and has impressive financial growth. Revenue increased by 85% year-over-year in\u00a0Q3 FY24 while net income jumped by 41% year-over-year to reach $26.9 million. The company has double-digit net profit margins.\n\nELF investors got spooked after\u00a0Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) warned investors of a slower quarter. However, that may not be bad news for Elf Beauty. The company can be using this opportunity to gain market share while another competitor isn\u2019t doing as well. It\u2019s possible that Elf Beauty is still performing well despite Ulta Beauty\u2019s warning. This is a case of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat leading up to Elf Beauty\u2019s earnings report. We\u2019ll learn more about the company\u2019s performance when that report comes out.

The company\u2019s revenue is well-diversified due to the large customer base, but Cintas can continue to reach additional businesses in North America.\n\nThe company hiked its annual revenue exceptions from a range of $9.48 to $9.56 billion to $9.57 billion to $9.60 billion after the latest earnings report.

        "content": "A Look Back at Specialty Retail Stocks' Q4 Earnings: Bath and Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) Vs The Rest Of The Pack\n\nLet's dig into the relative performance of Bath and Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q4 specialty retail earnings season.\n\nSome retailers try to sell everything under the sun, while others\u2014appropriately called Specialty Retailers\u2014focus on selling a narrow category and aiming to be exceptional at it. Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it. E-commerce competition exists and waning retail foot traffic impacts these retailers, but the magnitude of the headwinds depends on what they sell and what extra value they provide in their stores.\n\nThe 9 specialty retail stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues missed analyst consensus estimates by 1%.

        "title": "7 Buyback Kings to Buy as Corporate Cash Floods the Market",
        "content": "With corporate profits at record highs, many companies are returning much of that cash to investors through share repurchase programs. You can profit from this trend by entering long-term positions in buyback stocks.\n\nShare repurchases may have their social and political critics, but from the investor\u2019s standpoint, stock buybacks can be an effective tool for a company to maximize shareholder value. By reducing the amount of shares outstanding, repurchases can provide a lift for earnings per share.\n\nAs stocks typically rise over the long term in tandem with increases in per-share earnings, share repurchase programs can ultimately boost long-term total returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, what are some examples of top buyback stocks right now? Consider these seven. Each of them has initiated or expanded a large-scale share repurchase program in recent months.\n\nBuyback Stocks: Adobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nLast month, software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced plans to repurchase up to $25 billion worth of shares between now and 2028. Based on Adobe\u2019s current market cap, this represents around 11.8% of ADBE\u2019s outstanding share count.\n\nThis buyback news has thus far had zero impact on ADBE stock. In fact, waning excitement about the generative AI growth trend has overshadowed it. Nevertheless, in time, this buyback could play a role in getting ADBE moving in the right direction once again.\n\nWhy? Steadily decreasing the share count won\u2019t be the main driver, but alongside organic growth, it may contribute to Adobe delivering earnings growth in line with forecasts.\n\nThe sell-side estimates that Adobe\u2019s earnings will grow by around 13% during the fiscal year ending November 2025, with earnings experiencing another 13.4% increase during the fiscal year ending November 2026.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurant\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOn March 21, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) become one of the top buyback stocks, when the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse parent unveiled outside its latest earnings release plans to buy back up to $1 billion worth of DRI shares.\n\nAdmittedly, while $1 billion is a significant sum, for those aware of Darden\u2019s market cap, it may sound like a drop in the bucket. If the company were to repurchase DRI stock worth $1 billion today, this would only decrease DRI\u2019s outstanding share count by around 5.5%.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not as if Darden\u2019s share repurchase program is the only catalyst at play for the stock. InvestorPlace\u2019s Joel Baglole recently argued that the company\u2019s recent acquisition of Ruth Chris Steak House, plus the possibility of better-than-feared results following mixed results last quarter, are two additional factors that could give shares a lift down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuyback Stocks: eBay (EBAY) an ebay shipping box. cheap stocks\n\nSource: ShutterStockStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBack in February, alongside its latest fiscal results, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced that it had increased its share repurchase program by $2 billion.\n\nThis means that the online auction marketplace operator is now authorized to buy back as much as $3.4 billion worth of its outstanding shares.\n\nConsidering EBAY\u2019s current market cap of $26.6 billion, this means the company could retire as much as 12.8% of its outstanding shares. Decreasing the share count would help to counter the company\u2019s weak earnings growth in recent years, which has had a negative impact on the performance of EBAY stock.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Ebay is also aggressively reducing operating expenses, including mass layoffs, which stand to increase profitability. Even if growth remains slow, enhancements to the bottom line may lead to a re-rating for this undervalued tech stock, which currently trades for only 11 times forward earnings.\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nFedEx\u2019s (NYSE:FDX) post-pandemic slump may end soon. At least based on the shipping company\u2019s most recently released fiscal results.\n\nAlthough growth has yet to re-accelerate to Covid-era levels, much like other companies facing a growth slowdown, FedEx is making up for it through cost reduction efforts.\n\nThese efforts were material in last quarter\u2019s earnings beat. However, it wasn\u2019t just better-than-expected results that resulted in FDX stock surging following the March 21 earnings release. Rather, it was news of Fedex\u2019s latest share repurchase plans.\n\nAdding to the $1 billion in share repurchases last quarter, the company announced it would buy back another $5 billion in stock. Against FDX\u2019s current market cap of $65.9 billion, this means that Fedex is authorized to buy back as much as 7.6% of its outstanding shares. With this in mind, consider FDX one of the top buyback stocks to buy.\n\nBuyback Stocks: ODP Corporation (ODP) Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room. commercial real estate\n\nSource: GaudiLab / Shutterstock\n\nODPCorporation (NASDAQ:ODP) is the parent company of office supply retailers OfficeMax and Office Depot. Even as the company has reported declining sales and lackluster earnings growth in recent years, shares have performed well over the past few months.\n\nWhile not certain, a reason for this may be recent activist investor involvement. Back in December, hedge fund Arex Capital Managementstarted pushing for ODP\u2019s board to make sweeping changes to unlock value out of ODP stock, which trades at a highly discounted 8.9 times forward earnings.\n\nIn February, the company responded with its own set of proposed big moves. These included cost-cutting plans, as well as plans to buy back $1 billion worth of shares. For reference, ODP has a market cap of just $1.85 billion. Implementation of this share repurchase plan could go a long way in sending ODP to much higher prices.\n\nPVH (PVH) Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores. Retail Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Rawpixel.com / Shutterstock\n\nEarlier this month, PVH\u2019s (NYSE:PVH) latest quarterly earnings release elicited a negative reaction from the market.\n\nOn the heels of lackluster guidance, shares in the apparel company tumbled by over 22%. However, there was a silver lining contained within the earnings release.\n\nThat would be the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein parent\u2019s plans to buy back $2 billion worth of PVH stock between now and July 2028.\n\nAs $2 billion represents nearly a third of PVH\u2019s current valuation, this development makes it one of the top buyback stocks. Sure, the impact of this buyback will play out slowly. However, a rebound could happen far sooner\n\nHow so? As a Seeking Alpha commentator Seeking Profits argued in a post-earnings write-up on PVH, the aforementioned weak guidance may have been overly conservative. This suggests the strong possibility that the company delivers positive surprises with its next few earnings releases.\n\nBuyback Stocks: Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefront\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is another example of buyback news getting overshadowed by disappointing guidance.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 earnings release, Ulta reported results that exceeded expectations. The beauty retailer also said that it was launching a new $2 billion share repurchase program.\n\nHowever, instead of focusing on these positives, investors focused mostly on Ulta\u2019s guidance calling for weak margins. To make matters worse, ULTA stock has continued to tank over concerns about a beauty sales slowdown.\n\nHowever, in response to this sell off Loop Capital\u2019s Anthony Chukumba has upgraded ULTA from \u201chold\u201d to \u201cbuy,\u201d stating this selloff was \u201coverdone.\u201d\n\nWhile not citing the buyback plans in his upgrade, Chukumba did note that Ulta may soon start to return cash to shareholders in another way: by starting to pay a quarterly dividend. The analyst believes making such a move could result in a positive response from the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "4 Stocks to Watch From the Challenging Retail-Miscellaneous Industry",
        "content": "As stimulus-driven spending gradually wanes and interest rates remain elevated, the Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry is facing a crucial moment. Consumers are exercising caution with their disposable income. This change in consumer sentiment is impacting different merchandise categories, posing challenges for businesses. The recent report from the Labor Department revealed a 0.4% increase in the consumer price index for March. This has dashed hopes of any recent cut in benchmark interest rates.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the industry participants are proactively addressing the changing consumer environment by emphasizing a superior product strategy, enhancing their omnichannel capabilities and making prudent capital investments. Backed by these initiatives, companies such as Tractor Supply Company TSCO, Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS and Arhaus, Inc. ARHS are well-positioned to seize opportunities that may arise in this changed marketplace.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies and specialty products and sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, and art and craft specialty outlets and sell their products to farmers, ranchers and others, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers and specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.\n\n4 Key Industry Trends\n\nCautious Consumer Environment: The industry grapples with a complex set of challenges as a soft demand environment casts a shadow on overall sales and revenue prospects. Consumers are contending with a host of economic issues, encompassing high inflation, elevated interest rates and geopolitical tension. This economic landscape prompts shifts in consumer behavior, potentially altering purchasing patterns across various retail segments.\n\nPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in the SG&A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.\n\nStory continues\n\nFocus on Boosting Portfolio & Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omnichannel operations, coming up with reward programs and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.\n\nDigitization, Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Companies\u2019 initiatives to expand delivery options \u2014 curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders \u2014 and contactless payment solutions have been a boon. Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers\u2019 product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail \u2013 Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #156, which places it in the bottom 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of December 2023, the industry\u2019s earnings estimate has declined 16.7%.\r\n\r\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry vs. Broader Market\n\nThe Zacks Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry has underperformed the broader Retail \u2013 Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.\r\n\r\nThe industry has declined 2.3% over this period. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has risen 24.2%, and the broader sector has increased 27.6% in the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing retail stocks, the industry is currently trading at 16.24X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 20.88X and the sector\u2019s 22.44X.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.26X, as low as 10.97X and at the median of 16.54X, as the chart below shows.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)\n\n4 Stocks to Watch\n\nTractor Supply: Tractor Supply is positioned for growth, fueled by its unwavering commitment to the transformative \"Life Out Here\" strategy.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 17% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been pleasing. In the last three years the share price is up, 35%: better than the market.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nUlta Beauty was able to grow its EPS at 105% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 10% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt is of course excellent to see how Ulta Beauty has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.

On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade.

However, you may want to consider buying at least one of these seven top stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has entered a sharp correction ever since its competitor Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) warned investors about a slower beauty market. The recent pullback has resulted in a 46-forward P/E ratio for the cosmetics company.\n\nWhile some investors may feel nervous about the valuation, the reaction to Ulta news is overdone. The two beauty companies are in different leagues when it comes to growth rates. Ulta\u2019s revenue growth hovers at around 10% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Elf Beauty reported an 85% year-over-year increase in net sales and gained 305 basis points of market share in\u00a0Q3 FY24.\n\nElf Beauty has been maintaining 80% year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters while delivering impressive net income growth as well. The company also raised its fiscal 2024 outlook and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with a projected 30% upside. The stock has already been up by 92% over the past year. The correction presents a long-term buying opportunity, and it\u2019s possible for Elf Beauty to gain market share while others in the industry report slower sales. The second stock on this list follows that trend.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) An image of a hacker on a laptop with icons of messages and data behind him\n\nSource: jossnat / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow at a solid rate while competitors are slamming the brakes and announcing lukewarm guidance. Crowdstrike previously declined in solidarity with other cybersecurity stocks as they reported unfavorable guidance. Investors had a change of heart after Crowdstrike reported a strong earnings report for Q4 FY24.\n\nRevenue grew by 33% year-over-year to reach $845.3 million. The company also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue which serves as a good baseline. It\u2019s getting easier for hackers to threaten companies. They can use artificial intelligence to brute force their way into unprotected databases. These tools are getting more advanced, and the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform offers good protection from cyberattacks. This makes it one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike has always delivered impressive revenue growth, but the company\u2019s rising profit margins are also stirring up excitement. The company reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year. The stock has gained 392% over the past five years.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that helps businesses identify promising keywords. The first page of Google is prime real estate for online and local businesses. Those placements result in more website visitors who can turn into leads.\n\nCompetition in the industry is fierce, and Semrush gives many business owners the resources they need to succeed. Semrush is more than just keyword research. You can conduct detailed competitor analyses and discover opportunities to grow your business.\n\nThe stock has been bumpy since its IPO but is getting into the swing with a 31% gain over the past year. The company recently became profitable and reported an 8.5% net profit margin in\u00a0Q4 2023. That quarter also featured a 21% year-over-year revenue increase. Full-year net income came in at $1.0 million while the company generated $6.9 million in Q4 2023 net income.\n\nSemrush has approximately 108,000 paying customers which is a 12.5% year-over-year improvement. This broad customer pool can insulate the business from sharp revenue declines. Furthermore, some of the company\u2019s paying customers may upgrade their plans to access additional features.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is gaining market share in the fast food industry and continues to generate double-digit growth rates for its top and bottom lines. The fourth quarter of 2023 featured 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth and 26.1% year-over-year net income growth. Chipotle\u2019s net profit margin increased to 11.2%.\n\nThe company opened 121 restaurants in Q4 2023 and 271 new restaurants in the full year. Most of these restaurants include Chipotlanes, which allows the company to serve more customers. Chipotle has plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024 which is a 10.7% year-over-year improvement at the midpoint.\n\nChipotle stock will go through a\u00a050-for-1 stock split in June. The stock split will make shares more accessible and increase options trading volume. The stock has done a fine job of outperforming the stock market before its upcoming split. Shares are up by 308% over the past five years. It\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to win support from Wall Street analysts. Cloud computing, online marketplace sales, advertising, and video streaming are some of the catalysts that are prompting higher price targets.\n\nThe stock currently has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. Amazon only has Buy ratings from its 41 analysts. The highest price target of $230 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 24%.\n\nAmazon is growing in multiple industries and recently reported its highest-ever revenue. Net sales increased by 14% year-over-year to reach $170 billion in\u00a0Q4 2023. North American and international sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, while Amazon Web Services revenue growth stayed in line for Q4 2023 compared to full-year 2023. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nThe segment had a 13% year-over-year growth rate for both time periods. Advertising services did even better with 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has outperformed the stock market with a 146% gain over the past year. Shares are also off to a hot start with a 52% year-to-date gain and come with a 34 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company\u2019s commitment to expanding profit margins can result in a more enticing valuation in the future. Meta Platforms more than tripled its net income in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue was 25% higher in the quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\nMeta Platforms don\u2019t only have good growth rates. It also has a healthy balance sheet. The social media firm has $65.40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. On the other hand, it only has $18.39 billion in long-term debt. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 22% year-over-year to facilitate its profit margin expansion.\n\nMETA stock has now become a dividend growth play as the company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The company will probably maintain an annualized growth rate above 10% for many years.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that does not have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, sugar, or gluten. The drink also contains essential vitamins and plenty of caffeine.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock and have rated it as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The stock has a projected 11% upside at the average price target. The highest price target of $110 per share implies that shares can rally by an additional 31% from current levels.\n\nThe company is growing at a fast rate and is gaining market share from its competitors. Celsius Holdings reported 95% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q4 2023. The sports beverage company generated $322.8 million of its $347.4 million in North America. International revenue grew by 68% year-over-year and is still in its early innings.\n\nThe company is on the verge of tapping into Australian and New Zealand markets. The beverages will reach the continent in\u00a0Q4 2024. Domestic sales remain elevated, and international traction can lead to high revenue growth for several years. The company has maintained double-digit profit margins while generating substantial top-line growth rates. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, AMZN, and CELH.

        "content": "Investing legend Peter Lynch coined the term \u201c10-bagger.\u201d That is a stock that grows to 10 times the value of its initial investment. He knows a thing or two about hitting home runs with stocks.\n\nDuring his time as Fidelity Magellan\u2019s money manager, he took the fund from $20 million in assets under management (AUM) in 1977 to $14 billion AUM in 1990 when he retired for a 29% compounded annual growth rate. In other words, if you put $10,000 into the fund and never added another dollar, you would have $280,000 13 years later.\n\nLynch bought more than 100 ten-baggers while at Magellan, including Ford (NYSE:F), Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) and General Electric (NYSE:GE). You don\u2019t need that many to retire wealthy. You just need a couple of those stocks to become a millionaire, even if some of your investments completely strike out and go to zero.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are 3 stocks to become a millionaire that could turn $100,000 into $1 million in 10 years.\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) Smartphone with logo of American eVTOL company Joby Aviation on screen in front of business website.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not every day you have the chance to get in on the ground floor of a completely new industry. Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) offers that opportunity as it helps create the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry. While there is obviously risk involved in developing something out brand new, Joby is one that can pull it off.\n\nThe company was the first eVTOL company to complete the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) third phase of a five-phase regulatory process. Once it completes all five phases, Joby can launch its commercial robotaxi business. It is targeting a 2025 launch date and, so far, is on schedule.\n\nJoby has delivered one of its eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force for testing to date and just expanded its partnership to make it four planes it will deliver in total. Joby is also working with NASA on air traffic simulations out of the Dulles-Fort Worth area. Flying cars will be a new challenge for air traffic controllers. New York City will also electrify its existing helipads to accommodate Joby\u2019s flights.\n\nAlthough Joby Aviation is essentially a pre-revenue company, the eVTOL leader is counting down to launch. That could see its stock rocket to new heights very quickly and take a $100,000 investment to $1 million in 10 years, if not sooner.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nPersonal care and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is the second stock to help you become a millionaire. It is the largest specialty beauty retailer in the U.S., with 1,385 stores in all 50 states. ULTA stock is also a cash-generating machine.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past decade, the beauty company has grown its free cash flow (FCF) at a 26% compounded annual rate. It uses that money to return value to shareholders by buying back generous amounts of company stock. Last year it bought back 2.2 million shares worth $1 billion. Since 2014, Ulta Beauty has repurchased $5.8 billion worth of stock, while also investing in growing its business.\n\nThere is a certain recession resistance built into its business model, too, making it a perfect all-weather stock. Leonard Lauder of Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) coined the phrase \u201clipstick effect,\u201d which says during economic hard times, cash-strapped consumers turn to affordable luxury products like lipstick and makeup. Because they can\u2019t make large purchases, they splurge on small indulgences like lipstick.\n\nThat helps explain why, since Ulta Beauty stock\u2019s 2007 initial public offering, it has generated 1,278% returns for investors versus a 236% total return for the S&P 500. Look for this beauty queen to keep churning out excess returns for the next 10 years and beyond.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) space spacs Homepage of Rocket lab .Official website of company\n\nSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third stock to become a millionaire is satellite launch leader Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB). The company is the second most successful space venture after SpaceX. It might not be as showy as SpaceX, but Rocket Lab regularly launches rockets into space to put satellites into orbit. In March, it launched its 45th Electron rocket from its New Zealand launch pad making 181 satellites it has put into space so far.\n\nLater this month Rocket Lab will launch two more satellites, one an Earth observation satellite for Korea, and the other as part of NASA\u2019s Advanced Composite Solar Sail System.\n\nRocket Lab was also just awarded a $14.5 million contract from the U.S. Space Force for its space test program S30. It will be Rocket Lab\u2019s third such mission for the agency and secures the company as the leading small launch vehicle partner with the Defense Dept.\n\nTo make its services even more valuable, Rocket Lab is developing its next-generation rocket, the Neutron. It will be a bigger, heavier rocket capable of constellation deployment, cargo resupply and interplanetary missions. And stealing a page from SpaceX\u2019s playbook, Rocket Lab is undergoing testing of a reusable launch rocket. If successful, it should dramatically lower costs.\n\nAt less than $4 a share, Rocket Lab stock could easily launch itself into the stratosphere.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks Skyrocketing After Analyst Upgrades: Get In Before It\u2019s Too Late",
        "content": "The Wall Street rally has continued in April with the S&P 500 trading near recently-set record highs. The stronger-than-expected jobs report has boosted investor optimism as the U.S. economy remains resilient despite higher rates. In a bull market, Wall Street analysts tend to often raise ratings on stocks as they expect the outperformance to continue in the near term. In this blog post, we look at 3 stocks upgraded by analysts recently.\n\nAnalyst upgrades are a reflection of a positive sentiment among investors. Analysts tend to have regular conversations with large investors before they make recommendations on assets. The Wall Street sentiment received another boost yesterday after Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) raised its S&P 500 price target to the highest on the Street among large banks.\n\nA new target of 5535, up from 4625, is based on an earnings estimate of $270 for 2025 and a 20.5 times earnings valuation. This change suggests a 6% increase from current levels, indicating continued confidence in the market\u2019s upward trend.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe bank\u2019s strategists believe that the emphasis on artificial intelligence\u2019s growth and the concentrated nature of index holdings have led investors to focus more on future growth potentials rather than traditional valuation metrics.\n\nThey also note that systemic risk may be increasing due to current monetary policies encouraging risk-taking and leverage. However, they do not see an immediate peak in this risk, supporting continued aggressive valuation strategies until certain economic indicators signal otherwise.\n\nTheir investment strategy recommendation includes a mix of growth sectors like communications with defensive sectors such as healthcare and utilities. Mid-cap growth is highlighted for offering the best risk/reward due to its valuation, technicals and fundamentals.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is a leading beauty retailer in the United States, offering a diverse range of cosmetics, skincare products, fragrances, hair care items and beauty services. The company\u2019s stock saw its most significant drop since March 2020 after company executives indicated a slowdown in consumer interest for beauty products, negatively affecting the stock performance of similar companies in the industry.\n\nWhile many investors moved to sell shares in the company following this warning, the selloff has prompted some analysts to urge investors to buy a dip in this popular beauty and cosmetics stock. The company\u2019s strong fourth-quarter results, including a 14.6% operating margin \u2014 higher than the third quarter and surpassing management\u2019s forecasts \u2014 highlight the continuing strong demand for beauty products, analysts say.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost recently, Loop Capital upgraded Ulta Beauty stock from Hold to Buy as it believes the recent selloff is an overreaction, especially considering the challenging comparison Ulta faces in the first quarter of 2024. This leaves Ulta Beauty as one of the most debated stocks upgraded by analysts in recent days.\n\nThe forecast improvement over 2024\u2019s remaining quarters is expected to be driven by easier year-on-year comparisons and new product launches. The analysts also anticipate that Ulta\u2019s strategic stock buybacks and the potential initiation of a quarterly cash dividend could serve as positive catalysts for the stock.\n\nTake-Two Interactive (TTWO) Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) logo displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTake-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) is a prominent video game publisher known for its critically acclaimed franchises such as \u201cGrand Theft Auto,\u201d \u201cRed Dead Redemption,\u201d and \u201cNBA 2K.\u201d Take-Two also owns labels like Rockstar Games and 2K, offering a diverse portfolio of games across various genres for multiple platforms.\n\nOn Monday, the TTWO stock gained after Citi (NYSE:C) analysts raised their recommendation on shares and offered some very positive comments that gained wider investor attention. More precisely, Citi analysts raised their rating from Neutral to Buy, increasing the price target from $170 to $200.\n\nThe upgrade reflects optimism despite uncertainties surrounding the release timing of \u201cGTA VI,\u201d its potential bookings and the performance of the company\u2019s mobile games portfolio. The analysts outlined a bullish scenario of $235 and a bearish one at $130 for the stock, suggesting a favorable risk-to-reward ratio of 4:1 at current levels.\n\nThis analyst move comes after TTWO shares dipped two weeks ago following a report by a video gaming site Kotaku, which cited unnamed sources stating that the development of Grand Theft Auto VI is lagging, potentially missing its 2025 release target. Rockstar Games still aims for a spring 2025 launch, but insiders suggest a fall 2025 release is more likely, with a delay to 2026 also possible.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), one of the stocks upgraded by analysts recently, is a leading provider in the semiconductor and display equipment industry, specializing in manufacturing solutions for the fabrication of semiconductor chips, flat panel displays, and related industries.\n\nEarlier this week, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)analysts highlighted Applied Materials as a top pick in the semi sector with a strong Buy rating and a price target of $260. The recommendation is based on anticipated positive impacts from TSMC\u2019s capital expenditure and ASML\u2019s orders, suggesting a beneficial environment for Semiconductor Process Equipment.\n\nOne of the most closely-watched research firms on the Street emphasized Applied Materials\u2019 strong positioning to capitalize on secular growth opportunities in the industry, such as High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), Advanced Packaging, Gate-All-Around (GAA) technology, and Backside Power solutions.\n\nThis strategic positioning is expected to lead to market share gains and drive earnings power to approximately $11 per share in a semiconductor equipment market projected to reach $110 billion by calendar year 2025.\n\nAlso, Applied Materials has recently outpaced financial forecasts for its first quarter, showcasing a robust performance. As a leader in semiconductor equipment manufacturing, the company reported earnings of $2.13 per share and total revenue of $6.71 billion. These figures significantly exceeded analysts\u2019 predictions, who had anticipated earnings of $1.90 per share on revenue of $6.48 billion, further underscoring the company\u2019s strong market position and the accuracy of its strategic initiatives.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nShane Neagle is fascinated by the ways in which technology is poised to disrupt investing.

        "title": "Sephora, Ulta, and E.l.f. among the top beauty brands for US teens, per survey",
        "content": "Teens are crazy about cosmetics.\n\nScroll through TikTok, and you'll find Gen Zs (and Gen Alphas) sharing skincare routines, makeup tutorials, go-to fragrances, and hairdo how-tos.\n\nIn a new survey from Piper Sandler, Taking Stock With Teens, teens' overall \"self-reported\" spending was down 6% year over year to $2,263 \u2014 but they didn't hold back on beauty products.\n\nAnnual spending on beauty is up 8% to $339, the highest level since 2018, with make up holding the highest share, but fragrance seeing the most growth.\n\nThe young fashionistas are giving some beauty companies a boost. Sephora (MC.PA) and Ulta (ULTA) are the top beauty retailers for teens, at 37% and 31%, respectively. Target (TGT) clocks in at No. 3, with 10% listing it as their favorite.\n\nOther retailers that teens favor for cosmetics include Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), SHEIN, e.l.f. Beauty (ELF), and CVS (CVS).\n\nAfter Ulta reported its Q4 earnings in March, CEO David Kimbell said on an analyst call that young shoppers are interested in a spectrum of beauty products.\n\n\"Young consumers are engaged in mass [beauty], but they're also engaged in prestige [brands],\" he said. \"It's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily, as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media.\"\n\nThe increased sales from teens come as consumers pull back on overall beauty spending. Kimbell said at a conference last week that Ulta is seeing a slowdown across \"price points and segments.\"\n\nOverall, growth for US mass beauty brands is slowing, with sales increasing 3-4% year over year in Q1, compared to the 7% jump in Q4.\n\nUlta expects net sales of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion for 2024, up 4% to 5% from fiscal 2023, with an operating margin of 14.0% to 14.3%, down from 15% last year.\n\nIts stock has dropped 17% in the past month, after the soft outlook and comments about the slowdown.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Competitive intensity is definitely high, largely from Kohl's Sephora shop growth, and ULTA\u2019s 2024 guidance implicitly bakes in some level of market share inflection, adding an element of risk,\" added Evercore ISI analyst Michael Binetti wrote in a note to clients.

(Photo by Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images for Huda Beauty) (Cedric Ribeiro via Getty Images)\n\nWhen it comes to products, E.l.f. Beauty is the teen favorite with 38% of the votes, up 16 points compared to last spring.\n\nPer J.P. Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira, the 20-year brand is only getting started. \"There is plenty of runaway as [a] disruptor of a large category, with nimble and fast execution,\" she wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIts secret? The company has capitalized on social media, first as an early adopter of Facebook, then TikTok, with significant presence on Instagram, Twitch and Roblox. Its digital sales made up 24% of revenue last quarter.\n\nYet, e.l.f. Beauty shares are also under pressure, down 12% in the past month. Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans said now is the time to buy, alluding the recent stock pullback was \"driven by ULTA's commentary around a category slowdown,\" adding that \"demand remains robust\" for e.l.f. Beauty.\n\nSelena Gomez's Rare Beauty is a distant second, with 9% of teens pegging it as their favorite. Others in the top 10 include Maybelline, Charlotte Rilbury, and Rihanna's Fenty.\n\nFragrance makers are in luck. Nearly three-quarters of female teens said they use a perfume every day, up from last years' 66%.\n\nTheir favorite brand is Bath and Body Works (BBWI), with 29% of the votes, while L'Occitane Group's Sol de Janiero brand and Victoria's Secret (VSCO) took second and third, with 17% and 11%, respectively.\n\nBath and Body Works shares are up nearly 7% year-to-date, but underperform the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 10% gain. For fiscal 2024, the company is projecting flat to 3% decline in net sales, with a 2.5% to 4% year over year revenue drop in Q1.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) Omnichannel Focus Aids, SG&amp;A Costs Hurt",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA has been making the most of the favorable trends in the beauty industry with its robust omnichannel efforts. Healthy traffic, increased brand awareness and loyalty program expansion are working well for this beauty retailer.\r\n\r\nThese upsides, along with solid transformational efforts, reflected positively on fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the macroeconomic landscape remains dynamic in the near term, management expressed optimism about the beauty industry's resilience, highlighting growth opportunities for the company.\r\n\r\nTo fortify its leading position, the company aims to progress its transformative initiatives this year, including the completion of pivotal projects. Additionally, investments will be directed toward core traffic and experience enhancement strategies, aiming to bolster engagement levels and enrich the overall customer experience. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFocus on Core Priorities, a Major Driver\n\nUlta Beauty has been focused on its six strategic priorities. The company\u2019s foremost priority is to strengthen its omnichannel business and explore the potential of both physical and digital facets. ULTA is undertaking various tools to enhance the experience of guests, like offering a virtual try-on tool and in-store education and reimagining fixtures, among others. Thirdly, the company concentrates on providing customers with a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation.\r\n\r\nMoving on, ULTA is focused on deepening customer engagement by boosting rewards and loyalty programs. Fifthly, management is committed to optimizing its cost structure. Apart from these, the company strives to boost organizational talent and strengthen its culture.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of omnichannel, guests are effortlessly moving between physical and digital channels as management continues to invest in enhancing guest experience in all touch points. Ulta Beauty introduced 13 new stores, remodeled two and relocated two stores in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2024, the company expects 60-65 net new stores, along with 40-45 store remodeling and relocation projects.\r\n\r\nThe modernization of its digital technology ecosystem has been aiding ULTA in elevating and optimizing existing guest experience while driving digital innovation, utilizing a modern and agile approach. On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, management highlighted that comparable sales growth was driven by high-single-digit growth from its digital channels.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ULTA has been enhancing the Ulta Beauty at Target experience. The company opened 155 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during fiscal 2023, taking the total to 510 shops.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Skincare Category Stands Out\n\nUlta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out. The trend continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein skincare was the company\u2019s fastest-growing category, witnessing double-digit comp growth. Results gained from strength in brands like Bioma, Bubble, Good Molecules, La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica and Cetaphil. Guests\u2019 increased focus on self-care and maintaining healthy skincare routines, together with the company\u2019s focus on newness and innovation, keeps the skincare category well-positioned for continued growth.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nUlta Beauty\u2019s SG&A expenses have been rising year over year for a while now. Management expects SG&A deleverage in fiscal 2024 due to wage pressure, efforts to support core traffic and a focus on transformational agenda. SG&A is expected to increase by the high single digits in fiscal 2024, including a low-double-digit increase in the first half and mid-single-digit growth in the second half.\u00a0 The company also expects gross margin to decline modestly in fiscal 2024 due to soft merchandise margins and supply-chain cost deleverage.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ulta Beauty anticipates continued revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2024 due to its omnichannel strategy, customer engagement initiatives and curated product offerings. Management expects fiscal 2024 net sales in the range of $11.7-$11.8 billion, which suggests an increase from the $11.2 billion reported in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales are expected to rise 4-5%. For fiscal 2024, earnings are envisioned in the band of $26.20-$27 per share, which implies a rise from the $26.03 per share reported in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nShares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 15.2% in the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 25.7%.\n\n3 Retail Picks You Can\u2019t Miss\n\nBurlington Stores BURL sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. BURL, which operates as a branded merchandise retailer, has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 10.1%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Burlington Stores\u2019 current fiscal-year sales and EPS implies growth of 10.2% and 22.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nAbercrombie & Fitch ANF, a specialty retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. ANF has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 715.6%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s current fiscal-year sales and earnings implies growth of 5.6% and 19.1%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Kroger Co.

That's a bit earlier and a bit bigger than we thought,\" Ulta Beauty CEO David Kimbell told J.P. Morgan analysts during a fireside chat.\n\nShares of the company were headed for their worst day since May 26, 2023. Elf Beauty shares fell as much as 12.2%, tracking their worst day since May 2020. Coty and Estee Lauder both dropped about 5%.\n\n\"The competitive environment is intense, and we're feeling it particularly in a couple of areas. We lost share in prestige makeup. We've been challenged in haircare,\" Kimbell said.\n\nResilient demand for luxury makeup brands such as MAC Cosmetics, Clinique and Anastasia Beverly Hills as well as premium fragrances had lifted sales at Ulta in the last three years.\n\n\"We believe the decline in shares reflects uncertainty rather than a more tangible understanding of earnings downside,\" William Blair analyst Dylan Carden wrote in a note.\n\nUlta last month forecast annual profit below Wall Street estimates as supply chain costs and increased promotions squeezed its margins. In February, Estee Lauder announced it would cut jobs due to challenges in the Chinese market.\n\nUlta reiterated on Wednesday its comparable sales target of 4% to 5% growth for the year.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

        "title": "10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten AI stocks that will skyrocket. If you want to skip our overview of the AI industry and all the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\n\nIf we were to rewind the hands of time to 18 months back, not a lot of people would be hyped up about artificial intelligence. For the general public, the term would belong squarely to the realm of science fiction, and for those in the industry, AI becoming a worldwide phenomenon would appear to be a thing of the distant future.\n\nYet, with the first quarter of 2024 now over, AI is neither exclusively in the realm of science fiction and it is already a global phenomenon. The ball that started to roll with the debut of ChatGPT to the public in late 2022 and early 2024 has now sent chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by a whopping 518% since the close of 2022. At the same time, dozens of companies claiming to use large language models to help users with their daily lives are now live. They are joined by others that are selling video and image generation software for an industry whose computing needs are thought to sit in billions, if not trillions of dollars.\n\nThese computing needs are also at the center of a fundamental shakeup in the semiconductor industry. Before we get to that though, it's important to understand what AI really is. In layman's terms, AI is a set of mathematical formulae that seek to generate conclusions to queries or problems based on patterns that have been gleaned through training from an existing data set. The more voluminous and relevant this data set is, the better an AI system is, and voluminous data sets require large amounts of semiconductor chips called AI accelerators and GPUs for their processing.\n\nWhile the software end of AI is quite diverse, the hardware end can prove to be a bigger bottleneck simply due to the nature of chip fabrication. Making chips is neither cheap nor easy, and therefore, only a handful of companies in the world are capable of manufacturing high end semiconductors. In fact, only the American Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) are capable of making advanced AI chips. Out of these, only TSMC has been able to rapidly mass produce the latest chips, while Intel is catching up with its technology roadmap and Samsung fails to capture market share to stand its ground with TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis complexity and cost of manufacturing semiconductors is also why we regularly see unbelievable funding estimates for AI. In fact, the latest such bit comes from the The Information in form of a project that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI are working on. According to the details, the two plan on building a $100 billion U.S. based artificial intelligence supercomputer. The price tag is unsurprising since a single NVIDIA Blackwell GPU - one of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips in the world - costs between $30,000 to $40,000 according to fresh statements by NVIDIA chief Jensen Huang.\n\nSpeaking of Mr. Huang, even before the AI fever, he has advocated new technologies through which 'software will end up writing software' regularly during his technology conferences and earnings call reports. Now, with AI a permanent part of investor vocabulary, Huang's vision also appears to be coming to fruition. This is through the well known venture capitalist Peter Thiel backed startup Cognition Labs considering raising funding for a valuation of a whopping $2 billion. Cognition Labs seeks to develop an AI based tool to write code.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of AI stocks that could skyrocket, another major player in the AI race has been the Menlo Park, California based social media firm Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Before AI, Meta was one of the worst performing mega cap stocks on the market as investors remained unconvinced about its foray into the metaverse. However, it's a Wall Street AI darling now, with the shares up 129% over the past 12 months.\n\nHere's what\u00a0Wedgewood Partners had to say about Meta in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nMeta Platforms was a leading contributor to performance for the quarter \u2013 and the year. Core advertising revenue growth accelerated to +23% while operating margin rebounded strongly from a year ago. The Company has been a consistent beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past several years, investing aggressively in deep learning recommendation systems that help power its products, which reach nearly half the population of the planet. Meta Platform\u2019s AI investments, combined with its massive scale, allow the Company to quickly spin up new products across its digital advertising real estate to reinforce its competitive positioning. For example, the Company's relatively new Reels product is just over two years old, yet it has driven a +40% increase in the time Instagram users spend on the app. Reels content and other content served up to Instagram users is often driven by several very large and expensive AI recommendation systems that must sort through billions of datapoints in real time and come up with a probability of a user engagement. The Company is one of the few companies that has been able to consistently and profitably monetize AI technologies for shareholders and we continue to hold it has a top position in our portfolios.\n\nSo, wondering about which AI stocks will skyrocket? We shared our #1 AI stock pick that is trading at a steep discount with our premium subscribers, but there are other investment newsletters that have different stocks in mind. In this article we will take a look at what other investment newsletters think about the best way to bet on the future of AI. 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\nA high-tech robotic drone, showcasing the company's advancements in unmanned aerial systems.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the AI stocks that will skyrocket, we ranked AI stocks covered by multiple investment newsletter websites dating back as far as November 28th, 2023 by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q4 2023.\n\nFor these AI stocks that will skyrocket, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 most undervalued retail stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the retail industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Retail Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAccording to Economic Intelligence\u2019s consumer goods and retail outlook 2024 report, in 2024, global retail sales are projected to grow by 6.7%, with a 2% increase in volume due to a slowdown in inflation. Despite this growth, some challenges remain due to depleted household savings and high food prices, especially in developing economies. Additionally, the report states that online sales are expected to see double-digit growth in 2024, reaching 14.6% of total global retail sales. However, online retailers will continue to face challenges in maintaining profitability due to some regulatory issues.\n\nThe online retail industry experienced significant declines after its February 2021 highs. While the industry is still a long way from complete recovery, it still showed decent performance over the last 12 months. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY) is still 58.5% lower than its February 12, 2021 levels but has gained 38.21% in the last 12 months, compared to 27.20% gains of SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) and S&P 500\u2019s 30.82% gains, as of March 26 market close.\n\nFuture of Retail According to Retail Executives\n\nOn February 16, CNBC shared the predictions of top retail executives that included Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\u2019s (NYSE:ANF) CEO, Fran Horowitz, Levi Strauss & Co.\u2019s (NYSE:LEVI) CEO, Michelle Gass, chief e-commerce officer of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and a few others.\n\nThe executives mentioned that the retail landscape is shifting towards smaller, omnichannel stores that are strategically located to align with what customers want and need. The retail spaces will be set up to run smoothly and will guarantee a hassle-free shopping experience. Additionally, traditional brick-and-mortar stores are transforming into engaging places that offer immersive experiences and much more than the typical shopping trip to captivate customers' senses. Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\u2019s (NYSE:ANF) CEO, Fran Horowitz said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe future of retail is small, efficient, omni stores, and they\u2019re located where the customer tells us. [For Abercrombie] these big, massive stores were just not productive and not efficient \u2014 the consumer was responding to a much more intimate associate experience, and then economically, they were not productive. You don\u2019t get the kind of traffic through the stores like you did in the past when there wasn\u2019t a digital option, so you have to provide a location that is financially sound, which has X amount of traffic and X amount of digital orders that come together.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the executives emphasized the role of AI in the future of retail. They said that AI will reshape retail through personalized experiences owing to data analysis. Advanced algorithms will deliver tailored recommendations and promotions and that will improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, AI will help with the seamless integration of online and offline channels, which will make transitions for shoppers much easier. This can enhance convenience and flexibility and encourage customers to engage with retailers across various platforms. As CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI), Michelle Gass said:\n\n\u201cIf you think about the technology today, broadly speaking, a lot of what you might see in the personalization is, okay, if you\u2019re an avid buyer of [Levi\u2019s] 501s [jeans], you might get a recommendation on the next exciting wash of a 501, or something similar. But I think where the technology is going to go is it\u2019s going to be able to leap into something like, to go from you\u2019re a 501 shopper to this is going to be the perfect denim skirt for you and make bolder leaps, but do it in a way that\u2019s informed based on your shopping history and who you are.\u201d\n\nThe executives also stated that sustainability and inclusivity are some of the top priorities in retail, with a focus on inclusive sizing and sustainable practices like using eco-friendly materials and ethical sourcing. Sam\u2019s Club CEO Chris Nicholas mentioned that renewable energy and electric vehicles are going to become vastly important in the future of retail. On December 13, Walmart Canada announced putting Canada\u2019s first electric semi-trucks on the road. According to the company, each of the trucks will travel around 68,000 miles annually. On top of that, these trucks will save around 100,000 liters of fuel annually.\n\nRecent Updates on Major Retail Companies\n\nOne of the best discount retailer stocks and the largest retailer in the world, Walmart Inc.

Here are some comments from Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers.\"\n\nWith that in mind, some of the most undervalued retail stocks to buy now are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) (U.S.) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger\u2019s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger\u2019s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year\u2019s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger\u2019s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons could accelerate the company\u2019s earnings growth and produce additional scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.\u201d\n\n9. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)\n\nPE as of March 26: 17.54\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nDollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the most famous discount retailers in the US and offers a wide range of products, including but not limited to consumables, seasonal items, home products, etc. The company sells its products under various brands, namely Dollar General, Clover Valley, Smart & Simple, and more.

As of March 26, the stock has a PE ratio of 17.54.\n\nHedge fund sentiment was positive toward Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in Q4 of 2023. In the quarter, hedge funds with investments in the stock were 47, with positions worth $1.25 billion. This is compared to 38 funds with positions worth $1.13 billion in the third quarter. Holocene Advisors is the top investor in the company and has a position worth $257.206 million as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nArtisan Partners stated the following regarding Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur biggest full-year detractors included energy holdings Schlumberger and EOG and 2023 purchases Baxter International and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG). Dollar General, a discount retail chain in the US, has dealt with a few struggles. The retailer had previously benefited from COVID stimulus checks, reflected in the bump it experienced in revenues and margins. However, the effects have worn off, and its core consumer has been hurt by inflation, stiffer economic conditions, lower tax refunds and reduced SNAP benefits. Margins are also under pressure due to labor costs, shrink and markdowns. Some of the issues are likely self-inflicted. After years of focusing on store growth to drive the top line, store standards have suffered. Addressing store standards is needed to turn around flagging traffic, comps and customer satisfaction. On the positive side, discount retail due to its trade-down feature tends to be a defensive business during economic slowdowns. Dollar General has a strong market position and faces less competition than other discounters due to its largely rural footprint. The business\u2019s value proposition is everyday low prices, a convenient format and proximity. The company has leverage due to capital expenditures, but interest coverage of ~9X is strong. From a valuation perspective, the froth from the pandemic, when it traded in the low- to mid-twenties, is gone. So, we aren\u2019t paying for margin upside or store growth. Those would be bonuses. If the company can continue to grow revenues, generate cash flow and buy back stock, we still see a path to success.\u201d\n\n8. Bath & Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI)\n\nPE as of March 26: 12.53\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nBath & Body Works, Inc.

        "title": "Analysts Have Made A Financial Statement On Ulta Beauty, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ULTA) Yearly Report",
        "content": "Last week saw the newest annual earnings release from Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$11b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Ulta Beauty surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$26.03 per share, modestly greater than expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing the latest results, Ulta Beauty's 29 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$11.8b in 2025. This would be an okay 4.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$26.78, roughly flat on the last 12 months. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$11.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$26.79 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$582, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Ulta Beauty analyst has a price target of US$690 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$387. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Ulta Beauty's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Ulta Beauty's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 12% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this to the 149 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.0% per year.

        "content": "Ulta Beauty Inc showcases robust financial growth with net sales surpassing $11 billion. Strategic partnerships and innovative digital experiences continue to drive the company's market leadership. Investments in omnichannel experiences and private label offerings present significant opportunities. Market volatility and competitive pressures pose potential threats to Ulta Beauty Inc's growth trajectory.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA), the leading specialized beauty retailer in the U.S., has released its 10-K filing on March 26, 2024, providing a comprehensive view of its financial performance and strategic direction. With a financial year ending on February 3, 2024, the company has demonstrated impressive growth, with net sales reaching $11.21 million in thousands, a notable increase from the previous year's $10.21 million in thousands. This growth is underpinned by a strong gross profit margin, which has risen to $4.38 million in thousands. The company's net income has also seen a healthy uptick to $1.29 million in thousands, reflecting a solid financial foundation. These financial highlights set the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis, providing investors with insights into Ulta Beauty Inc's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as it navigates the dynamic beauty retail landscape. Decoding Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Leadership and Brand Portfolio: Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) stands out with its expansive brand portfolio, offering approximately 25,000 products from around 600 established and emerging beauty brands. This diverse range caters to a wide range of consumer preferences, contributing to the company's strong market position. In fiscal 2023, makeup accounted for 42% of sales, while skincare and haircare products contributed 21%, showcasing a balanced product mix. The company's strategic partnership with Target has further extended its reach, with over 500 Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shops enhancing its market presence.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital and Omnichannel Prowess: Ulta Beauty Inc's investment in digital innovation has paid off, with its website and mobile applications offering interactive and personalized experiences. The company's virtual try-on and skin analysis tools, leveraging augmented reality and artificial intelligence, have set a high bar for customer engagement in the beauty retail sector. These digital capabilities, combined with a variety of fulfillment options, position Ulta Beauty Inc as a leader in omnichannel retailing.\n\nLoyalty Program Success: The Ulta Beauty Rewards program is a cornerstone of the company's strength, with more than 95% of total sales generated from members. This loyalty program not only fosters customer retention but also provides invaluable consumer insights, allowing Ulta Beauty Inc to tailor experiences and promotions effectively.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOperational Cost Pressures: Despite its financial success, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) faces operational cost pressures, including higher wage rates and transportation and shipping costs. These macroeconomic trends have the potential to erode profit margins if not managed effectively. The company's efforts to optimize processes and upgrade its enterprise resource planning platform are steps toward mitigating these pressures, but the challenge remains significant.\n\nInventory Management: The company's merchandise inventories have increased, with a reported $138,685 in thousands adjustment for the fiscal year 2023. This suggests potential inefficiencies in inventory management, which could lead to excess stock and associated carrying costs. Effective inventory management is crucial for maintaining profitability and cash flow health.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion of Product Lines and Services: Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) has the opportunity to further expand its product lines and services, particularly in emerging beauty and self-care trends. The company's focus on exclusive brands and products, such as its private label Ulta Beauty Collection, presents a significant opportunity for growth and differentiation in the market.\n\nOmnichannel Experience Enhancements: The company's strategic pillar to evolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems offers substantial opportunities for growth. By expanding its physical footprint and enhancing digital experiences, Ulta Beauty Inc can drive greater engagement and capture a larger share of the beauty market.\n\nThreats\n\nCompetitive Market Dynamics: The beauty retail industry is highly competitive, with new entrants and established players vying for market share. Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its leadership position. The company's ability to respond to competitive pressures and dynamic market conditions will be critical for its long-term success.\n\nEconomic Volatility: Economic fluctuations can impact consumer spending patterns, particularly in discretionary categories like beauty. Ulta Beauty Inc faces the threat of reduced consumer spending in the event of an economic downturn, which could adversely affect sales and profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) exhibits a strong financial performance and strategic positioning, with a robust brand portfolio, innovative digital capabilities, and a successful loyalty program. However, the company must navigate operational cost pressures and inventory management challenges. Opportunities for expansion and omnichannel enhancements are promising, but competitive pressures and economic volatility pose potential threats. Overall, Ulta Beauty Inc's strategic initiatives and market understanding position it well to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the evolving beauty retail landscape.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks That Could Skyrocket in 2024",
        "content": "The recent rally in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices has taken them to new all-time highs. Many stocks have also coasted on the wave of optimism to hit new highs, in line with improving investor sentiment over the reduced pace of inflation. Many companies are also seeing their revenue and earnings rise, thus helping to justify higher valuations and providing fuel for the rally.\n\nThere has never been a better time to search for good growth stocks to own for the long term. With interest rates poised to decline, consumer sentiment should improve and generate optimism that things will get better. Picking stocks with strong market positions, great track records, and astute management will enable you to generate explosive returns over time.\n\nThere are three stocks with these attributes that could even be positioned to soar for the remainder of the year. Here's why we think this trio of stocks should do well. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) owns and operates around 3,400 restaurants in the U.S. and Europe, serving a wide variety of delicious Mexican-inspired offerings. The company has logged consistent growth over the past three years, with 2023 being no different.\n\n2023 saw revenue rise 14% year over year to $9.9 billion, with comparable restaurant sales increasing by 7.9% year over year. Chipotle also managed to increase its overall operating margin from 13.4% to 15.8% and restaurant operating margin to 26.2%, up from 23.9%. The Mexican-themed restaurant chain continued to expand its reach, with the record opening of 271 new restaurants for the year.\n\nChipotle has demonstrated steady growth, with revenue rising from $7.5 billion in 2021 to $9.9 billion in 2023. Net profit climbed from $653 million to $1.2 billion over the same period, even as the number of shares fell by close to 3%, allowing earnings per share to soar 94% from $22.90 to $44.34. The business also generated increasing free cash flow for all three years, rising from $840 million in 2021 to $1.2 billion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\n2024 promises to be an interesting year for Chipotle, as it targets to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants. Management also projects full-year, mid-single-digit year-over-year comparable restaurant sales growth.\n\nLast year, Chipotle inked its first-ever development agreement with franchise operator Alshaya Group to open restaurants in the Middle East as part of its efforts to internationalize the business. Investors can look forward to the company opening new restaurants in Dubai and Kuwait that will contribute to its top line.\n\nChairman and CEO Brian Niccol remains confident that Chipotle can achieve its long-term goal of opening 7,000 restaurants in the U.S. while continuing to improve its margins.\n\n2. Caterpillar\n\nCaterpillar(NYSE: CAT) is a manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, as well as diesel and gas engines, turbines, and locomotives serving three key sectors: construction, resource, and energy & transportation. The company's share price recently hit a record high after it reported a solid set of earnings for 2023.\n\nRevenue rose 12.8% year over year to $67.1 billion, while operating income surged by 64% year over year to $13 billion. Net income climbed 54.1% year over year to $10.3 billion. It was Caterpillar's best year in its 98-year history, with the equipment company declaring a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share, capping a consecutive, three-decade increase in its dividend.\n\nSales climbed from $51 billion in 2021 to the current $67.1 billion for 2023, with net income jumping from $6.5 billion to $10.3 billion over the same period, showcasing Caterpillar's consistent growth in both its top and bottom lines. Diluted earnings per share nearly doubled from 2021 to 2023, going from $11.83 to $20.12. The company also generated consistent free cash flow in all three years, going from $4.7 billion in 2021 to $9.8 billion in 2023.\n\n2024 should see an operating margin at the top end of Caterpillar's projected range, with an increase in prices to exceed manufacturing costs. The company's strong pricing power showcases its ability to maintain sales volume while upping its prices to keep ahead of inflation. Services revenue is also expected to grow, as Caterpillar targets $28 billion of such revenue by 2026. Investors should note, however, that Caterpillar's revenue and earnings can be cyclical. The heavy equipment manufacturer tends to do well when the economy is on an upswing because of higher demand for construction and infrastructure development. When a downturn arrives, demand may fall sharply as its customers cut back on spending and delay their projects. Despite this cyclicality, Caterpillar remains a solid stock to own as its revenue and earnings have trended higher over time, thus showcasing its dominant position and pricing power.\n\n3. Ulta Beauty\n\nUlta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) is the largest specialty beauty retailer for cosmetics, fragrances, skincare products, and hair care services in the U.S., with 1,385 retail stores across 50 states as of March 14.\n\nThe company's recently ended fiscal 2023 saw the retailer report a 9.8% year-over-year rise in revenue to $11.2 billion. Operating income edged up 2.4% year over year to $1.7 billion, while net income increased by 4% year over year to $1.3 billion. Ulta Beauty also generated a positive free cash flow of $1 billion for the fiscal year.\n\nFiscal 2023 caps off a successful year of growth, where the retailer opened a total of 30 new stores. Ulta Beauty boasts a track record of rising sales and profitability over the past three fiscal years. Sales rose from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2020 to $10.2 billion for fiscal 2022, with net income surging from $176 million to $1.2 billion over the same period. The cosmetics specialist also generated consistent positive free cash flow averaging $905 million for all three fiscal years.\n\nThese numbers attest to the strength of Ulta Beauty's franchise and showcase its growing membership base. Its loyalty program saw the number of members rise from 32 million in fiscal 2018 to 40 million in fiscal 2022, with close to 95% of sales made by its members. Euromonitor estimated back in 2022 that the U.S. beauty products market is worth $104 billion, implying that Ulta Beauty still has room for significant future growth in this large but fragmented market.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Ulta Beauty expects comparable sales to continue growing by 4% to 5%, with plans to open another 60 to 65 net new stores. Investors can look forward to continued growth for Ulta Beauty as it caters to a wide assortment of customers with a variety of price points through its omnichannel offerings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Caterpillar wasn\u2019t one of them.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to\u00a0Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nThe resurgence in US stocks, buoyed by what's been labeled the \"most-crowded trade,\" underscores the market's resilience. Led by a surge in tech megacaps, often referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" equities bounced back, mitigating earlier losses. This trend, characterized by Bank of America Corp., highlights the dominance of a select group of technology giants driving market gains. Notably, Nvidia Corp. experienced a notable uptick, fueled by optimism surrounding its latest chip technology, which is anticipated to catalyze further growth, already evidenced by a staggering $1 trillion increase in the company's market value this year. Simultaneously, the bond market stabilized following a recent downturn, during which traders adjusted their expectations for future policy easing. As Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve's decision, scheduled for Wednesday, investors are closely monitoring signals regarding potential adjustments to the rate-cut outlook. Amid these developments, Bank of Japan's Ueda commented on the confirmation of a positive feedback loop between wages and prices, contributing to the broader economic landscape. The collective sentiment among traders underscores the intricate interplay between market dynamics and central bank policies, shaping investment strategies and market movements. As the landscape evolves, market participants remain vigilant, analyzing emerging trends and developments for potential opportunities and risks.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has made a significant policy shift by abandoning its negative rates and unconventional easing measures, reported CNBC. This move, following robust wage negotiations and signals of sustainable price increases, marks a departure from its long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy. The decision triggered a sharp decline in the Japanese yen, reflecting market reactions to the BOJ's shift towards normalizing monetary policy. Going forward, the BOJ will focus on utilizing short-term interest rates as its primary policy tool, aiming to maintain accommodative financial conditions while gradually scaling back its asset purchases. However, the central bank remains cautious about the pace of rate hikes, considering the fragile economic outlook. While the immediate global impact of the BOJ's decision is expected to be limited, concerns persist about potential volatility stemming from the unwinding of carry trades and capital repatriation to Japan. Nevertheless, the BOJ's gradual approach to policy normalization suggests a measured response to evolving economic conditions. Looking ahead, market analysts anticipate continued adjustments in bond yields and monetary policy as the BOJ navigates the complexities of achieving sustained economic growth. The broader implications of these policy shifts are yet to unfold, with market participants closely monitoring developments and their potential impact on global financial markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nOn March 18, Wells Fargo & Company raised their price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares from $141.00 to $144.00 while maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating for the stock. This adjustment signifies the bank's updated assessment of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) valuation and outlook within the technology sector. The move by Wells Fargo & Company reflects their analysis of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) performance and potential future growth opportunities. By increasing the price target, they indicate their belief that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is poised for appreciation, although the specific upside potential is not provided. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), operating in the technology industry, is renowned for its diverse portfolio of products and services, including its dominant search engine, advertising platform, and cloud computing solutions. The company's continued innovation and expansion efforts contribute to its appeal among investors. The decision to maintain an \"equal weight\" rating suggests a balanced view of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock, neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic. Investors may interpret the revised price target as a signal of confidence in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) long-term prospects. It provides guidance for investors evaluating their positions in Alphabet, offering insights into the potential trajectory of the stock price.\n\n09. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)\n\nUpside Potential: 0.60%\n\nOn March 18, Wells Fargo analyst Jeffrey Donnelly affirmed his Equal-Weight rating for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) while increasing the price target from $234 to $250. This adjustment reflects Wells Fargo's updated assessment of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) valuation and prospects within the hospitality industry. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) operates in the hospitality sector and is renowned for its global portfolio of hotels and resorts spanning various brands and segments. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as travel trends, economic conditions, and competition within the industry. By raising the price target, Wells Fargo indicates a modest upside potential of 0.60% for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) stock compared to its current market price of $248.52. This suggests that while Wells Fargo remains relatively neutral on Marriott's prospects, they still see some room for appreciation in the stock. Maintaining an Equal-Weight rating suggests that Wells Fargo believes Marriott's stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions.\n\nVulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a company that we have owned several times in the past. The company is an asset-light global lodging franchisor and operator that benefits from strong network effects. Approximately 99% of Marriott\u2019s global rooms are managed or franchised which enables the company to generate high returns on capital. Marriott has an extensive portfolio of brands ranging from luxury brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, to premium brands such as Westin Hotels & Resorts, to select brands such as Residence Inn by Marriott. The company is doing an excellent job converting independent hotels into the Marriott system through its soft brands including the Luxury Collection, the Autograph Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio. This conversion opportunity should benefit Marriott\u2019s net unit growth in a period when new hotel development could be challenging in North American and Europe. The company generates robust free cash flow through its long-term, contracted franchise fee and management fee revenue streams. Its competitive advantages include brand strength, operational scale, direct booking systems, and loyalty programs. We sold Marriott in the first quarter of 2020 because of our concerns about the company\u2019s debt structure. Since then, Marriott has restructured its debt and improved its balance sheet. Additionally, average daily rates (ADR) on corporate travel have returned to pre-Covid levels.\u201d\n\n08. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nUpside Potential: 6%\n\nOn March 18, Piper Sandler updated its outlook on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), a leading company in the consulting and professional services industry. They raised the price target on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) from $335 to $394 while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This adjustment reflects Piper Sandler's assessment of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) performance and prospects within the competitive landscape of consulting and professional services. Accenture operates in an industry characterized by providing a wide range of services to businesses worldwide, including strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations. With the increase in price target, Piper Sandler indicates a potential upside of 6% for Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock compared to its current market price of $372.67. This suggests that while Piper Sandler sees some room for appreciation, they remain relatively neutral on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) outlook.\n\nThe Neutral rating implies that Piper Sandler believes Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions. This rating takes into consideration various factors, including Accenture's financial performance, competitive position, and growth prospects in the consulting and professional services sector. Piper Sandler expects Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) second-quarter results to meet expectations, with revenue likely to be in-line amid muted market expectations. However, they anticipate the company may adjust the top end of its fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range of 2%-5% due to a potentially slower path to second-half acceleration. Particularly, the consensus for third-quarter growth of +7.4% quarter-over-quarter appears ambitious, according to Piper Sandler. The analysis also highlights historical trends, noting that Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has not experienced a similar level of improvement between the second and third quarters since 2017. Additionally, Piper Sandler underscores the importance of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) commentary on the macroeconomic environment, as industry peers have differing views on the timing of enterprise spend acceleration. This commentary will likely be closely monitored by investors for insights into Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) future performance and industry trends.\n\nClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAnother welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant\u00a0Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.\u201d\n\n07. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN)\n\nUpside Potential: 10%\n\nOn March 18, BofA Securities provided an updated assessment of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), a prominent player in the electrical equipment industry. Analyst Andrew Obin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and revised the price target upwards from $320 to $325. This adjustment reflects BofA Securities' analysis of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) performance and outlook within the competitive landscape of the electrical equipment sector. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) operates in an industry characterized by providing a diverse range of electrical products and services to various sectors, including industrial, commercial, and residential markets. With the increase in the price target, BofA Securities suggests a potential upside of 10% for Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stock compared to its current market price of $298.75. This indicates BofA Securities' optimism about the company's growth prospects and market positioning. The Buy rating signifies BofA Securities' belief that Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stock offers attractive investment opportunities relative to its peers and market conditions. The increased price target reflects BofA Securities' confidence in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) ability to deliver strong performance and create value for shareholders.

This endorsement underscores BofA Securities' confidence in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) ability to generate sustained growth and shareholder returns in the dynamic landscape of the electrical equipment sector.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile renewable stocks have come under pressure of late, energy efficiency and decarbonization remain strong drivers for our industrials holdings, where\u00a0Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) and Trane Technologies (TT) were strong contributors. Eaton, whose electrical equipment enables the electrification of the power grid and electrical vehicle charging infrastructure, is benefiting from tax incentives supporting clean energy, growth in reshoring and expanding manufacturing in North America and the need for grid resiliency amid broad demand for electrification.\u201d\n\n06. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nUpside Potential: 13%\n\nOn March 18, Loop Capital provided an updated analysis of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), a leading player in the streaming entertainment industry. Analyst Alan Gould reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock and adjusted the price target upward from $585 to $700. This update reflects Loop Capital's assessment of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) performance and outlook within the highly competitive streaming entertainment sector. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u00a0operates in an industry characterized by providing digital streaming services for a wide range of entertainment content, including movies, TV shows, and original productions. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as subscriber growth, content acquisition, and competition from other streaming platforms. With the increase in the price target, Loop Capital suggests a potential upside of 13% for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock compared to its current market price of $618.39. This indicates Loop Capital's confidence in the company's growth prospects and market position.\n\nThe Buy rating signifies Loop Capital's belief that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock presents attractive investment opportunities relative to its peers and market conditions. By maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target, Loop Capital reiterates their positive outlook on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and encourages investors to consider the stock as a potential investment opportunity. This endorsement underscores Loop Capital's confidence in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to innovate and capture market share in the evolving landscape of streaming entertainment.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms\u2014both categorized in the communication services sector\u2014rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Netflix and other media stocks were out of favor due to questions about the long-term economics of streaming, slowing subscriber growth and increasing competition. Meta\u2019s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market. Despite growth having slowed, Netflix\u2019s position as the largest streaming service with currently close to 250 million subscribers is a key strategic advantage. Streaming is a scale and intellectual property business model that will result in a few large winners. Netflix remains far ahead of all streaming peers in subscribers, revenue, content spend and cash flow generation. Importantly, Netflix has also evolved its business model over the past year, becoming more efficient with its content spending, cracking down on password sharing and introducing a lower cost advertising-supported tier (lowering subscriber churn). These changes have led to robust earnings and free cash flow growth. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Biggest Solar Companies in the World 16 Sites Like Alibaba: Best Alternatives to Source Products 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US\n\nDisclosure: None.

The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, operating margin, and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy, our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5% driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high team growth last year. A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies, and new fulfillment and technology capabilities enabled our teams to deliver mid-single digit comp growth for the holiday period.\n\nOur holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling which inspired authentic connection, leading to record-breaking impressions, significant growth in shared voice, and strong social engagement. These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content combined with successful promotional strategies drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopping frequency and retention. From a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3rd, 2024, according to Circana data.\n\nOur market share of prestige Beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continued to face pressure from the expansion of beauty distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. Turning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like Bioma, Bubble, and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica, and Cetaphil.\n\nThe fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Nuna's from Valentino, Burberry, and Tree Hut, and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites YSL, Gucci, and Billie Eilish, contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. Top sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness and prestige Cosmetics were partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continued to resonate with beauty enthusiasts, and brands leaning into these trends, including Elf, Nyx, and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth.\n\nWhile prestige Makeup was challenged in totality as we lacked strong growth last year, luxury brands Dior, Natasha Denona, and Pat McGrath continued to engage guests, and Hourglass Tard and Lancome saw success with compelling holiday offerings. Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on styling and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra, and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with Way, Mielle, and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and Lola Bay also resonated with guests. Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions.\n\nIn addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, textures, services, and ear piercing drove strong engagement with guests. Turning now to the full year, net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion, comp sales increased 5.7%, operating profit was 15% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touchpoints, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry.\n\nWe launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beauty Counter, and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one conscious beauty pillar and continued to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our Muse Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness.\n\nAdditionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. Turning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touchpoints. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guests about new products, new techniques, and the latest beauty trends.\n\nWe also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new, modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app, and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in ecommerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same day delivery to all stores and increased our ship from store capabilities to 450 stores. Between focus, same day delivery and ship from store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year.\n\nFinally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, re-engagement of lapsed guests and greater loyalty account linkage, as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand building efforts resulted in record level, unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place.\n\nWe expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trend setting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members.\n\nWe are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements, and deliver future profitable growth. I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution Center, opened our Greer Market Fulfillment Center and began work on our Bolingbrook Market Fulfillment Center.\n\nWe successfully transitioned our Jacksonville Greers and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform, and we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. We built a New Enterprise Data Platform on Google Cloud Infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities, and we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. Our teams enable our success and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.\n\nAssociate retention improved across stores, distribution centers, and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforced that our overall associate engagement remains strong. Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofit, and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the science-based target initiative. I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders, while also enabling new capabilities for future growth.\n\nAs we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last three years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth, in 2024 we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single digit range, barring a major economic event. Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects, while also investing in core traffic and experience drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve, and expand all things beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast.\n\nTo strengthen our differentiated position, we'll continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury, while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. In addition, this year we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our Conscious Beauty platform and we will continue to enhance and amplify luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touchpoints. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels, and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment, and engaging services and events, while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization, and optimizing our store teams. A photograph of a customer testing out different products in the skincare aisle at a store.\n\nWe also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion, and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty and Target shops, evolve the assortment, and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the JOY project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program.\n\nWe will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition, while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement, and we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts, in fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including project SOAR, digital store, and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media, and overall ecommerce efforts.\n\nOur supply chain optimization journey will continue. As our Bolingbroke Market Fulfillment Center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas Distribution Center, and we begin the retrofit of our remaining full service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhance associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. Turning to our final strategic pillar, we intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact.\n\nBuilding on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our roadmap to achieve our emission reduction goals. Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the US. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing, and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly.\n\nAnd I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023, while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities, and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates, and the communities we serve.\n\nNow, as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call, and I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. Now, today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1st. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott?\n\nScott Settersten : Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2% driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions.\n\nAverage ticket declined 1.9% driven by lower units per transaction which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall increase. Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lapped the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated two, remodeled two stores and closed two stores. For the quarter gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin.\n\nOur efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions, and royalties earned through our Target partnership. At the same time, we realize benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality, as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year, but continues to be well below 2019 levels. Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor, and new fragrance fixtures.\n\nFor the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. Moving to expenses, SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses in store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.\n\nIn addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleverages during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities, and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives, as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business.\n\nOperating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7% driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share.\n\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina, as well as the impact of product cost increases. Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $124 million for IT, $73 million for supply chain, and $60 million for store maintenance and other.\n\nDepreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352, 000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to $1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Before I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty.\n\nIt has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward.\n\nPaula Oyibo : Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share two capital allocation updates. First, yesterday we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retained flexibility to upsize the capacity, if needed.\n\nSecond, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024, we expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures, and support core traffic and experienced drivers.\n\nIn total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single digit growth in the second half of the year.\n\nFor modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margin. Finally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels, and merchandise fixtures, $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT, and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook.\n\nWe will share more of the logistical details later this summer. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A.\n\nSee also 6 Cheaper Alternatives to Braces for Kids and Adults and 10 Alternatives to Antidepressant Medications.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "title": "Why Ulta (ULTA) Shares Are Falling Today",
        "content": "Why Ulta (ULTA) Shares Are Falling Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of beauty, cosmetics, and personal care retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) fell 7.7% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided full-year revenue guidance, which was roughly in line; its full-year earnings forecast was underwhelming and missed.\n\nOn the other hand, Ulta beat analysts' same store sales, revenue, and gross margin expectations. Its EPS also outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Zooming out, this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Ulta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nUlta's shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 2 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago, when the company gained 9.8% on the news that the company reported third quarter results with same-store sales beating convincingly, although revenue only narrowly topped expectations. Profitability was sound, leading to a nice EPS beat in the quarter.\u00a0The company raised its full year outlook for important metrics such as same-store sales, revenue, and EPS.\n\nFinally, management commentary in the release was optimistic, citing healthy traffic trends and a good setup for the important holiday shopping season. The beauty category seems to be holding up well despite a backdrop of consumer uncertainty, fueling the argument that many beauty products are more staples-like than discretionary (consumers buy them both in good economic times and bad).\n\nAs a reminder, when Target reported its quarterly results on November 15, 2023, the consumer bellwether also called out strength in beauty purchases. Zooming out, we think this was a solid quarter, showing that the company is staying on target.\n\nUlta is up 10.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $539.31 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $567.18 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Ulta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,594.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

Kimbell\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy. Our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. \r\nFor the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5%, driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high-teen growth last year. \r\nA thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies and new fulfillment and technology capabilities, enabled our teams to deliver mid-single-digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling, which inspired authentic connection, leading to record breaking impressions, significant growth in share of voice and strong social engagement. \r\nThese successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content, combined with successful promotional strategies, drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopper -- shopping frequency and retention. \r\nFrom a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, according to Circana data. Our marketing share -- our market share of prestige beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continue to face pressure from the expansion of beauty -- distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. \r\nTurning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest-growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like BIOMA, Bubble and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continue to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica and Cetaphil. \r\nThe fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Newness from Valentino, Burberry and Tree Hut and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites, YSL, Gucci and Billie Eilish contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand, to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. \r\nComp sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continue to resonate with beauty enthusiasts. And brands leaning into these trends, including e.l.f., NYX and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth. While prestige makeup was challenged in totality as we lapped strong growth last year, luxury brands, Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Pat McGrath continue to engage guests. And HOURGLASS, Tarte and Lanc\u00f4me saw success with compelling holiday offerings. \r\nFinally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single-digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on silane and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with OUAI, Mielle and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and LolaVie also resonated with guests. \r\nOur services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, texture services and ear piercing, drove strong engagement with guests. \r\nTurning now to the full year. Net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%. Operating profit was 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. \r\nIn addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry. \r\nWe launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beautycounter and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one Conscious Beauty pillar and continue to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. \r\nWe expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed to the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our MUSE Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. \r\nTurning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touch points. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guest about new products, new techniques and the latest beauty trends. \r\nWe also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in e-commerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. \r\nTo support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same-day delivery to all stores and increased our ship-from-store capabilities to 450 stores. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship-from-store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. \r\nFinally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations, ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, reengagement of labs guests and greater loyalty account linkage as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. \r\nMoving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand-building efforts resulted in record level unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. \r\nWe expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trendsetting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. \r\nWith improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members. We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. \r\nFinally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution, which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. \r\nOur fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth. \r\nI am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, opened our Greer market fulfillment center and began work on our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville, Greer and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform. And we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. \r\nWe built a new enterprise data platform on Google Cloud infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities. And we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. \r\nOur teams enable our success, and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year, we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforce that our overall associate engagement remains strong. \r\nFinally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofits and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. \r\nI am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace, and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders while also enabling new capabilities for future growth. \r\nAs we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last 3 years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2024, we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, barring a major economic event. \r\nBeauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year, we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects while also investing in core traffic and experienced drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. \r\nStarting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we will continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. \r\nIn addition, this year, we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our conscious beauty platform. And we will continue to enhance and amplify Luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. \r\nReflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touch points. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment and engaging services and events while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization and optimizing our store teams. \r\nWe also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. \r\nOperating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the Joy Project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement. And we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. \r\nTurning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media and overall e-commerce efforts. \r\nOur supply chain optimization journey will continue as our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas distribution center, and we began the retrofit of our remaining full-service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. \r\nTo protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhanced associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. \r\nTurning to our final strategic pillar. We intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our road map to achieve our emission reduction goals. \r\nFinally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the U.S. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. \r\nThe Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts, and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset-light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly. And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands, to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. \r\nAs a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. \r\nIn closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023 while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates and the communities we serve. \r\nNow as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call. And I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. \r\nNow today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. \r\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo, who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. \r\nFinancial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line, reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2%, driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. \r\nAverage ticket declined 1.9%, driven by lower units per transaction, which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall comp increase. \r\nLooking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December, reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lap the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. \r\nDuring the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated 2, remodeled 2 stores and closed 2 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs, which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions and royalties earned through our Target partnership. \r\nAt the same time, we realized benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year but continues to be well below 2019 levels. \r\nNotably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. \r\nMoving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. \r\nIncentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. \r\nOffsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. \r\nFinally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. \r\nTo recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales, with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. \r\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina as well as the impact of product cost increases. \r\nOur well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. \r\nIn fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $124 million for IT; $73 million for supply chain; and $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. \r\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352,000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to 1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. \r\nBefore I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward.\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nThank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty, and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. \r\nBefore we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share 2 capital allocation update. First, yesterday, we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retain flexibility to upsize the capacity if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. \r\nNow turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures and support core traffic and experienced drivers. \r\nIn total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single-digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single-digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. \r\nOur assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margins. \r\nFinally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT; and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. \r\nWe believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. \r\nBefore we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. \r\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\n\nRupesh Dhinoj Parikh\n\nAlso, Scott, best wishes on retirement. So I wanted to start out just with the prestige cosmetics category. As you look towards this fiscal year, we're seeing a lot of newness in stores. You're moving past, I think, pretty difficult comparisons. So just curious if you guys expect to return to share gains within the prestige cosmetics category.\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nRupesh, thanks for your question, and thanks for calling out, Scott, well deserved. Yes. I'll say on makeup, and I'll even speak a little bit more broadly across all our categories, we are focused on driving growth in every part of our business. Our makeup business in 2023, particularly in the second half, we saw healthy growth on the mass side and more challenges on the prestige side. So we have a strategy to drive performance within all parts of our makeup business. It is our largest segment and obviously important in the beauty category. \r\nOur efforts are holistic. We've got a number of new brands that we believe will either already are or will add value to the category, including the launch of Charlotte Tilbury, which just rolled out recently, also exclusive brands like Half Magic and Polite Society, Rabanne, innovation from our existing big brands that we'll continue to see that have been so important to our business like Tarte and Benefit and Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me on the prestige side. \r\nOur luxury proposition really launched last year to -- with a lot of success. And as we continue to grow and build our presence in that space, we see that as a contributor. And then through our holistic efforts, we're going to try to find ways to lean into the important trends. Makeup is -- of course, has a key trend component. So whether it's blush, shade, proliferation, lip layering, matte makeup, nail is an important opportunity, we're going to continue to drive that. \r\nAnd the last thing I'd say is we continue to revamp and elevate our events that play an important role in mass migration, the number of mass consumers that we've acquired over the years, continuing to introduce them to prestige for the first time. So we're focused on driving that business. We are confident over time that we'll be able to deliver the growth that we expect, and we're working hard to deliver across all parts of that business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler.\n\nKorinne N. Wolfmeyer\n\nCongrats on the quarter. I'd like to touch a little bit on the decision to enter into Mexico. I mean previously, we've been talking about potentially going into Canada. Just would like to understand your thought process of going or doing Mexico versus Canada. And what kind of opportunity do you really see there over the longer term?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nI'm just going to say we're really excited about this announcement and really, as I said in the prepared remarks, see Mexico as a great opportunity that's tailor-made for the Ulta Beauty experience. Kecia is leading this effort among many things that she does. So I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color on it.\n\nKecia L. Steelman\n\nYes, absolutely. Well, after careful evaluation of many market opportunities, we really felt like the Mexican market is the next step for Ulta Beauty for us to have this partnership with Axo. And we're really excited about this. I know that the future is going to be really bright in this partnership. We've spent a lot of time with their teams from a cultural perspective, also just even from the best-in-class performance with global partners that they've brought to the Mexico consumer -- the Mexican consumer. \r\nOur border stores are performing really, really well. And I just think it's the next natural step for us as we continue to expand internationally. So we are really excited about this. Again, we are planning to be operational in 2025. The cost of this is built into the guidance in '24. So we don't feel like it's very material. But we're super excited and feel that Axo is the right partner for us to launch in this next new territory for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.\n\nJuliana Duque\n\nThis is Juliana on for Ike. I just wanted to ask in regards to thoughts on the beauty categories moving forward, particularly the balance of prestige and mass, and maybe in addition, how we can see that driving merchandise margin given the benefit that we've seen.\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nWell, for the overall category, as I mentioned in the remarks, we're fortunate to be in a category that continues to be healthy, that is highly connected to our consumers, a high level of engagement, that there's an emotional connection that's driving the category and has been for a very long time, and then certainly coming out of COVID, has been exceptionally strong. \r\nAll indicators, as we look at the consumer landscape, is a continued level of engagement. When we look into this year, though, of course, we are evaluating and anticipating and preparing for consumer behavior to continue to evolve. We know there's external pressures on the consumer. We know we're entering into a dynamic time with an election year. \r\nAnd what we've seen in this category is strong growth, but as expected, some moderation in that growth. Still above historical trends but some moderation. Simply put, we think consumers, highly engaged in the category but still -- and still passionate about the category but will continue to be thoughtful in all of their spending. But fortunately, we know that beauty is an important one. \r\nAnd as a reminder, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to manage through really any kind of economic disruption or challenge given our unique portfolio, all price points, all categories that allow us to meet our consumers' needs if there is a time that they feel more pressure or have other changes. But overall, category healthy. Paula, as it relates to any potential margin changes?\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nYes. What I would say is our merchandise margin, I would remind, we are meaningfully higher and better, our merchandise margin since 2019. And really that has a lot to do with we are a much healthier business now, and we have -- our mix in our business between our categories as well as prestige and mass through category performance efforts over the years has really helped us be able to be flexible as the consumer shifts between various categories as well as between mass and prestige. And so we believe that our -- we're able to manage that dynamic.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nSusan Kay Anderson\n\nI wanted to maybe ask about the store expansion. It looks like it picks up this year. I guess how should we think about timing throughout the year? And then also, should we expect these to be the full-size stores? Or are you going to roll out any of the smaller test stores that you've been looking at? And then also, just how do you think this helps to maybe win back some of the share from other competition?\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nThanks, Susan. We are planning to open between 60 and 65 net new stores in fiscal 2024. That puts our growth between the 2-year period at 90 to 95, which is generally in line with the 100 that we had communicated. And so our thinking hasn't materially changed there. \r\nWe remain confident in our ability to open and operate between 1,500 and 1,700 traditional Ulta Beauty freestanding locations in the U.S. And we're optimistic the small format store prototype could give us an opportunity for additional growth, as does the partnership with Target and then similarly as we're excited about the additional opportunity with our international expansion into Mexico. Related to the small geographies, we are planning to open 10 small store formats in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies.\n\nAshley Elizabeth Helgans\n\nSo we just wanted to ask for an update on UB Media. Anything you can share about the number of brands that are currently on the platform, maybe demand for the platform? And then any color to help us model as UB starts to scale?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nYes. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made. As a reminder for those on the call, this really does represent a way for us to generate positive impact on our business by leveraging the first-party data and insights that we have in partnering with our brands. We're not sharing, we haven't shared and we don't plan to share specific on a number of brands or even specific financial impact at this time. \r\nBut what I will say is we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in 2023 and are confident that we'll continue to grow this part of the business. The network that we have offers advertising access via off-site display, video, social influencers as well as on-site sponsored products. Our on-site display inventory is one of the actually new core offerings that we activated just in 2023. \r\nSo we've got a full suite of ad inventory experiences, value-added services. And as I said, we're confident in its impact going forward. And the support, engagement, reaction from brands has been very positive. As you know, the advertising world continues to evolve. So the value that we can bring through first-party data with 43 million beauty enthusiasts is very meaningful. And we continue to work with our brand partners, and they have demonstrated to us that they see a positive return. And we're continuing to grow that business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\n\nOlivia Tong Cheang\n\nCongrats, Scott, and looking forward to working with you, Paula. I wanted to ask you a little bit about your thoughts on new product contribution this year because it does seem like certainly starting off with the momentum with Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro. We did some store tours in New York recently, and the team is very energized around these brands. So was wondering if you could talk about contribution this year versus previous years and then helping us understand sort of -- I think you mentioned Sol de Janeiro that -- a portion of the doors. Maybe can you give the same statistics for Charlotte Tilbury? \r\nAnd then on the margin, I would just love a little bit more detail in terms of what's driving the margin outlook to the 14% to 14.3% end of the longer-term range, whether there's anything, sort of higher investment or what have you that's sort of dragging that to that end of the range?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nOkay. Thanks, Olivia. Yes, I'll talk about new product at our newness pipeline, and then Paula can pick up on your question around margins. So we're -- well, first, I'll say newness is always a critical part of our business and historically has been between 20% to 30% of our sales. And that's an important part of the category and one of the best things about the category. There is a large desire from our beauty enthusiast guests from our members to discover what's new and exciting across all of our categories. \r\nAnd so we do have what I believe is a well-balanced portfolio of new brands between big, recognized brands like Charlotte Tilbury as well as a steady stream of emerging brands that are unique or exciting within the Ulta Beauty environment. And so we don't -- we're not going to give any specific numbers about newness this year versus last year. But I will give you a couple of highlights. \r\nFirst, you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury. And just to reiterate, that is in 600 stores and online, and we're excited about that. It was one of the top requested brands from our members, and we're pleased to be partnering with them to bring a unique and powerful experience to life. Sol de Janeiro is in 700 stores and also online and also was highly requested and brings just a terrific experience in-store and online and has been very well received since we launched that in January. \r\nBut there's a whole range of products that we're going to continue to launch and bring to life. We do focus, as I said, on emerging brands. And while I'm not going to, for competitive reasons, share some in the pipeline that are ahead of us, I'd highlight some of the brands that we launched last year like LolaVie, Polite Society, Half Magic, a brand like Live Tinted, which has been with us for a little bit, important brands playing an exciting role in driving growth in various categories that we're excited about. And our luxury business that I talked about, we continue to add brands to that throughout the year and see growth. \r\nSo newness is important. We see -- we like the balance that we have. We're excited about the brands that we've launched so far, and I look forward to rolling out more partnerships and bringing newness across our portfolio throughout 2024. Paula, on the margin question?\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nYes. So from an operating margin perspective, we shared 14% to 14.3% of sales. And that is mostly deleverage coming from SG&A as we complete many of our foundational elements of our transformation agenda and move to investments to enable growth as well as we operationalize the investments that we made to date and those go into one state. We also are managing ongoing wage pressures, which is assumed in the guidance. And we also will continue to support core traffic and experienced drivers. \r\nAnd so as you think about SG&A growth for the year, it will moderate into the high single-digit range from the 12.5% growth we saw in fiscal 2023. And then we do expect gross margin to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage from supply chain costs are partially offset by the growth we see and expect in other revenue.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.\n\nMichael Allen Baker\n\nReally just a follow-up on what you just said. The -- can you tell us where you are in this investment -- these foundational investments? I think you said $62 million in 2023, which was below plan, and shift some into 2024. So what should it be in 2024? And even working backwards, can you remind us what it was in '21 and 2022? It was sort of supposed to have a 3-year investment plan that is rolling off. It sounds like it's still rolling off and -- although there will be some lingering costs in 2024. So just trying to conceptualize what 2024 investments will look like versus 2023.\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nYes, Michael, I'll start with some of the numbers and then turn it over to Kecia so she can give a little bit more flavor for where we are. So we had an incremental $55 million in 2022 related to our transformational strategic investments. We communicated $62 million incremental in 2023. As you think about 2024, we expect limited incremental investment as we complete the foundational elements of our transformational agenda. Think about Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT projects. \r\nBut as I communicated, once we complete those particular systems, these upgraded systems roll into our core operations and become a part of our base, and there's run costs associated to that. So there is run cost associated with those foundational investments. We will continue to invest to enable growth as well as the other items that I mentioned regarding wage pressures and investing in traffic and experienced drivers. Kecia?\n\nKecia L. Steelman\n\nYes. So in regards to like where we are on the investments and where we are in the projects for our ERP upgrade or what we're internally calling as Project SOAR, just this week, we completed our Dallas DC. And we have plans to wrap up Greenwood and Fresno and open up our new MFC in Bolingbrook, which is a relocation of the existing FFC in Romeoville before peak this year. Part of the ERP upgrade, we're also transitioning our store systems and our merchandising systems. And we have those plans to be completed before the second half, again prior to peak. \r\nFor supply chain in '24, we are continuing to invest in our automation capabilities. And I mentioned already the MFC in Bolingbrook hits on our supply chain lines and then also finishing out that retrofit in Dallas -- the Dallas DC. And then for the Digital Store of the Future, so our Digital Store platform, we expect that to be completed in the first half of 2024. And we're wrapping up all of our upgrades around our analytical tools and reporting capabilities. So bottom line, we continue to be on track and on our budget, and we are all in on wrapping these foundational enabling systems up this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.\n\nAnthony Chinonye Chukumba\n\nLet me add my congratulations to Scott as well. It's been a pleasure working with you all these years. So my question was on the luxury brands. I guess just 2 parts to the same question, both pretty quick. First off, how did they perform relative to your expectations in 2024? And what are your expectations in terms of additional brand rollouts -- luxury brand rollouts in 20 -- sorry, in 2023? And then what are your expectations for additional luxury brand rollouts in 2024?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nGreat. Well, thanks for the question. And yes, luxury, as I said, was one of our -- one of many initiatives last year to drive engagement. And we're really pleased with establishing that more firmly with some of our existing partners, including Chanel, but Dior, NATASHA DENONA, Pat McGrath. And so we see strong performance, and we're really pleased with how our guests are engaging in that part of the business. \r\nWe had a lot of confidence going in because of existing relationships with brands like Chanel. And then by elevating and expanding it, it has really, we believe, met our guests' needs. And they're excited about it. And it further demonstrates our ability to deliver all things beauty from all price points, including luxury. \r\nWe're not sharing any specific launches of anything beyond what I've already shared today. More broadly, as I said, with newness, we have a steady stream of newness throughout the year, and we'll continue to innovate. Specifically within luxury, our focus is continuing to grow in partnership with the brands that we've launched and find new ways to expand those businesses and delight our guests with them. And we're really pleased and proud to have that experience in our stores.\n\nKiley F. Rawlins\n\nOperator, can we have the last question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.\n\nAdrienne Eugenia Yih-Tennant\n\nScott, congratulations. It's been great, and thanks for all the help over the years. This question is maybe for Dave or Kecia. Can you talk about the promotional environment that your guidance is under for 2024? Is it expected to sort of remain in maybe the first half and then abate or kind of preexist all year long and whether it was more from prestige? Are you concerned that there perhaps is a longer-term shift to mass or masstige from younger or more price-sensitive consumers? \r\nAnd then Scott and Paula, just a quick one. In your 4% to 5% comp, what are you expecting in terms of any ASP increases this year? And what's the rationale behind the low single-digit to mid-single-digit comp in the back half? What's going to drive the acceleration?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nSo yes, just on the promotional environment, what -- I probably won't answer every one of your detailed questions because we're not going to break it out that way exactly. What I'll say more broadly is we're not expecting that the promotional environment is going to significantly intensify or become irrational. We are in a competitive environment. That's for sure. And we are focused on ensuring that we're delivering on our leadership position. \r\nSo as we look forward, we would anticipate and we have in our plans the ability to drive our business, which includes marketing, store labor, digital experiences and promotional activity as appropriate. But not an expectation more broadly for a significant step. And we do anticipate, as we saw in 2023, that it will still remain well below 2019 levels. \r\nThe mass to mass prestige question, we see opportunity across both parts of the business. Yes, consumers are engaged, and young consumers are engaged in mass, but they're also engaged in prestige. They're loving our luxury experience. So it's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media. Those brands will win and -- regardless of the price points. Paula, do you want to give a little color on some of the 4% to 5%?\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nSure. Adrienne, on your question with regards to expectation around ASP, what I would share is that we are planning for a more normalized pricing environment in 2024.\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nGreat. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. I'd like to close by thanking our 55,000 associates for delivering a strong 2023. Together, I know we will continue to unleash the unique power of beauty and keep moving our business forward in exciting ways. I'm optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty and confident we will continue to create significant shareholder value. \r\nI do want to take 1 second to thank Scott again. Scott, as I said, has been an amazing partner to all of us, and I so appreciate his impact and his leadership. And I want to thank those on the call that have the chance to thank him yourself. I know he loved spending time in all of our meetings and all of our earnings calls. It was -- I know he appreciated partnership with all of you, and I do want to thank Scott for everything you've done for our company. Thank you, Scott. \r\nWe look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on May 30. Thank you again, and have a great night.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

        "content": "Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA posted strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\r\n\r\nResults were backed by the success of the company\u2019s holiday season strategies and carefully curated product selection, which resonated well with customers. These factors led to increased traffic, greater brand recognition, and robust member growth. Moving into 2024, the company is well-positioned for continued revenue and earnings per share (EPS) growth. While the macroeconomic landscape remains dynamic in the near term, management expressed optimism about the beauty industry's resilience, highlighting growth opportunities for the company.\r\n\r\nUlta Beauty further highlighted the potential for global expansion as a long-term strategic opportunity. After careful evaluation of different operating models, partnerships, and geographical considerations, the company has unveiled the creation of a joint venture with Axo, in a bid to launch and manage Ulta Beauty in Mexico, scheduled for 2025. Axo boasts extensive expertise in managing global brands.\n\nQuarterly Numbers\n\nUlta Beauty reported an EPS of $8.08 in the quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.49. The bottom line surged 21% from the $6.68 in the year-ago period.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote\n\nNet sales of this beauty product retailer advanced 10.2% year over year to $3,554.3 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,519 million. The uptick can be attributed to higher comparable sales, solid new store performance, increase in other revenues and benefit from an additional week.\r\n\r\nComparable sales (sales for stores open for at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) jumped 2.5% compared with our estimate of 1.4% growth. Comparable sales growth was driven by a 4.5% improvement in transactions, partly offset by a 1.9% drop in the average ticket.\r\n\r\nThe gross profit advanced 10.6% to $1,340.6 million. The gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 37.7%, up 10 basis points year over year. Higher other revenue, lower supply-chain costs and reduced shipping rates fueled the upside. Our model suggested a gross margin expansion of 40 bps to 38%.\r\n\r\nSG&A expenses rose 7.6% to $820.4 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 23.1%, down from the 23.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. Increased corporate overheads related to strategic investments were more than offset by leverage of incentive compensations, along with lower marketing expenses as well as store payroll and benefits.\r\n\r\nThe operating income ascended 15.5% to $517.1 million. The operating margin expanded 60 bps to 14.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Updates\n\nUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $766.6 million. Net merchandise inventories were $1.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Stockholders\u2019 equity at the end of the quarter stood at $2,279.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,476.3 million for the 53 weeks ended Feb 3, 2024.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, Ulta Beauty did not have any borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility.\r\n\r\nThe company repurchased 352,000 shares for $159.5 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. In fiscal 2023, ULTA repurchased 2.2 million shares for $1 billion. As of Feb 3, 2024, Ulta Beauty had shares worth $99.9 million left under its $2 billion buyback program announced in March 2022.\r\n\r\nOn Mar 12, management unveiled a new repurchase plan of $2 billion, which will replace the abovementioned March 2022 authorization. Management expects to buy back shares worth $1 billion in fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2024, the capital expenditure is expected to be in the band of $415-$490 million.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, Ulta Beauty introduced 13 new stores, remodeled two and relocated two. Ulta Beauty ended the fiscal fourth quarter with 1,385 stores totaling 14.5 million square feet.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2024, ULTA expects 60-65 net new stores, along with 40-45 store remodeling and relocation projects.\n\nGuidance\n\nUlta Beauty expects fiscal 2024 net sales in the range of $11.7-$11.8 billion. The company reported net sales of $11.2 billion in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nComparable sales are expected to rise 4-5%. Management expects an operating margin between 14% and 14.3%.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2024, earnings are envisioned to be in the band of $26.20-$27 per share, suggesting a rise from the $26.03 per share reported in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 36.7% in the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 28.8%.\n\nSolid Retail Picks\n\nHere, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks.\r\n\r\nAbercrombie & Fitch ANF, a specialty retailer, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s current fiscal-year earnings suggests growth of 3.2% from the year-ago reported numbers.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Ulta Beauty on Thursday forecast full-year profit below Wall Street estimates after elevated supply chain costs and increased promotions hurt margins, sending its shares down 4.5% in extended trading.\n\nDespite the beauty retailer's efforts to boost sales through steep discounts, inflation-weary consumers cut back spending on discretionary items such as cosmetics and hair care products.\n\nAlthough pressure from retail shrink, where inventory is lost or damaged due to theft and breakage, has risen over the past few years, it persists as a challenge for retailers with several companies flagging an impact on margins.\n\nUlta Beauty now expects its annual operating margin to range between 14.0% and 14.3%, down from 15.0% reported in 2023.\n\nThe company forecast annual adjusted earnings per share between $26.20 and $27 per share, the mid-point of which fell below analysts' average estimate of a profit of $27 per share, according to LSEG data.\n\nIt expects fiscal 2024 revenue to be between $11.7 billion and $11.8, largely above LSEG estimates of $11.69 billion.\n\nThe beauty retailer reported a profit of $8.08 per share for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, compared with expectations of $7.53.\n\nQuarterly revenue rose about 10% year-on-year to $3.6 billion, ahead of analysts' expectations of $3.53 billion.\n\nShares of the Illinois-based company hit an intra-day record high on Thursday before closing down at $565.44. The stock has surged around 15% in 2024.\n\n(Reporting by Annett Mary Manoj in Bengaluru; Editing by Shweta Agarwal)",

        "content": "Ulta's (NASDAQ:ULTA) Q4 Earnings Results: Revenue In Line With Expectations\n\nBeauty, cosmetics, and personal care retailer Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) reported results in line with analysts' expectations in Q4 FY2023, with revenue up 10.2% year on year to $3.55 billion. The company's outlook for the full year was also close to analysts' estimates with revenue guided to $11.75 billion at the midpoint. It made a GAAP profit of $8.08 per share, improving from its profit of $6.68 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Ulta? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nUlta (ULTA) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $3.55 billion vs analyst estimates of $3.53 billion (small beat) EPS: $8.08 vs analyst estimates of $7.54 (7.2% beat) Management's revenue guidance for the upcoming financial year 2024 is $11.75 billion at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations and implying 4.8% growth (vs 9.7% in FY2023) Management's EPS guidance for the upcoming financial year 2024 is $26.60 at the midpoint, below analyst expectations of $27.03 Gross Margin (GAAP): 37.7%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $994 million, up 24.2% from the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales were up 2.5% year on year\u00a0(beat vs. expectations of up 2.0% year on year) Store Locations: 1,385 at quarter end, increasing by 30 over the last 12 months Market Capitalization: $27.54 billion\n\nOffering high-end prestige brands as well as lower-priced, mass-market ones, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an American retailer that sells makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products.\n\nBeauty and Cosmetics Retailer\n\nBeauty and cosmetics retailers understand that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but a little lipstick, nail polish, and glowing skin also help the cause. These stores\u2014which mostly cater to consumers but can also garner the attention of salon pros\u2014aim to be a one-stop personal care and beauty products shop with many brands across many categories. E-commerce is changing how consumers buy cosmetics, so these retailers are constantly evolving to meet the customer where and how they want to shop.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales Growth\n\nUlta is larger than most consumer retail companies and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge over its competitors.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 10.9% over the last four years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) was decent as it opened new stores and grew sales at existing, established stores. Ulta Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Ulta's year-on-year revenue growth clocked in at 10.2%, and its $3.55 billion in revenue was in line with Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 3.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth and demand for retailers.\n\nUlta has generated solid demand for its products over the last two years. On average, the company's same-store sales have grown by a healthy 10.9% year on year. This performance suggests that its steady rollout of new stores could be beneficial for shareholders. When a company has strong demand, more locations should help it reach more customers seeking its products. Ulta Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, Ulta's same-store sales rose 2.5% year on year. By the company's standards, this growth was a meaningful deceleration from the 15.6% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago. We'll be watching Ulta closely to see if it can reaccelerate growth.\n\nKey Takeaways from Ulta's Q4 Results\n\nIt was good to see Ulta beat analysts' same store sales, revenue, and gross margin expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, while full year revenue guidance was roughly in line, its full-year earnings forecast was underwhelming and missed. Zooming out, we think this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. Investors were likely expecting more, and the stock is down 3.5% after reporting, trading at $546 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Ulta right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

(NASDAQ: ULTA) today announced financial results for the fourteen-week period (\"fourth quarter\") and fifty-three-week period (\"fiscal year\") ended February 3, 2024, both of which contain one extra week (\"53rd week\") versus the comparable thirteen-week and fifty-two-week periods ended January 28, 2023.\n\n14 Weeks Ended 13 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended February 3, January 28, February 3, January 28, (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales $ 3,554.3 $ 3,226.8 $ 11,207.3 $ 10,208.6 Comparable sales (1) 2.5% 15.6% 5.7% 15.6% Gross profit (as a percentage of net sales) 37.7% 37.6% 39.1% 39.6% Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 820.4 $ 762.7 $ 2,694.6 $ 2,395.3 Operating income (as a percentage of net sales) 14.5% 13.9% 15.0% 16.1% Diluted earnings per share $ 8.08 $ 6.68 $ 26.03 $ 24.01 New store openings, net 11 12 30 47\n\n(1) Comparable sales are based on a comparable number of weeks from the prior year.\n\n\"We closed out a strong 2023 with better-than-expected fourth quarter financial performance. Our compelling holiday plans and thoughtfully curated assortment resonated with our guests and delivered healthy traffic, record brand awareness, and strong member growth. I am proud of how our teams drove these results while making meaningful progress on our multi-year, transformational investment agenda to enable new capabilities for future growth,\" said Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer. \"We enter 2024 well-positioned to drive strong top and bottom-line growth, build on our foundational capabilities, and unlock further advantages of our differentiated model.

Net sales in the 53rd week were approximately $181.9 million. Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 2.5% compared to an increase of 15.6%, driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions and a 1.9% decrease in average ticket. Gross profit increased 10.6% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 37.7% compared to 37.6%, primarily due to strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates, and leverage of supply chain costs, largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 7.6% to $820.4 million compared to $762.7 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.1% compared to 23.6%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and store expenses. Operating income increased 15.5% to $517.1 million, or 14.5% of net sales, compared to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales. Net interest income decreased to $3.3 million compared to $4.4 million due to interest paid on borrowings during the quarter. The tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Net income increased 15.7% to $394.4 million compared to $340.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 21.0% to $8.08, including $0.46 due to the extra week of sales, compared to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\n\nFull Year of Fiscal 2023 Compared to Full Year of Fiscal 2022\n\nNet sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion compared to $10.2 billion, primarily due to increased comparable sales, strong new store performance, strong growth in other revenue, and the benefit of the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales increased 5.7% compared to an increase of 15.6%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. Gross profit increased 8.3% to $4.4 billion compared to $4.0 billion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 39.1% compared to 39.6%, primarily due to lower merchandise margin and higher inventory shrink, partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs. SG&A expenses increased 12.5% to $2.7 billion compared to $2.4 billion. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 24.0% compared to 23.5%, primarily due to higher corporate overhead due to strategic investments, higher store payroll and benefits, higher marketing expenses, and higher store expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Operating income increased 2.4% to $1.7 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, compared to $1.6 billion, or 16.1% of net sales. Net interest income increased to $17.6 million compared to $4.9 million, due to higher average interest rates on cash balances. The tax rate decreased to 23.9% compared to 24.4%, primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes and benefits from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Net income increased 3.9% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased 8.4% to $26.03, including a $0.14 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation and a $0.46 benefit due to the 53rd week, compared to $24.01, including a $0.07 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $766.6 million.\n\nMerchandise inventories, net at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brand launches, 30 net new stores, increase in distribution center inventory primarily due to the opening of the new market fulfillment center in Greer, SC, and product cost increases.\n\nAs previously announced, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company borrowed $195.4 million on its revolving credit facility to support ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures, and merchandise inventory growth. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company repaid all amounts borrowed, together with interest due.

The new program has no expiration date but may be terminated by the Board at any time.\n\nStore Update\n\nReal estate activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 included 13 new stores located in Anaheim, CA; Brea, CA; Brenham, TX; Dartmouth, MA; Glassboro, NJ; Goldsboro, NC; Hialeah, FL; Jacksonville, FL; Land O'Lakes, FL; Missouri City, TX; Orange, CT; Orlando, FL; and Venice, FL.

Non-GAAP earnings are expected between 14 cents and 15 cents per share.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $110.5 million, indicating a rise of 9.44% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 15 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days, and indicates year-over-year growth of 87.5%.\r\n\r\nPagerDuty\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 141.52%, on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for PagerDuty prior to this announcement:\n\nPagerDuty Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPagerDuty price-eps-surprise | PagerDuty Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nPD\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to have benefited from ongoing digital transformation and strong demand for its solutions. Growing demand for automation and generative AI is expected to have driven PagerDuty\u2019s top-line growth.\r\n\r\nIncreased demand for automated and intelligent incident management solutions is expected to have benefited PagerDuty\u2019s operations cloud.\r\n\r\nImproved customer retention and steady growth in the enterprise market are anticipated to have driven top-line growth amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.\r\n\r\nMacro uncertainty continues to keep consumers\u2019 budgets and spending under pressure, which is expected to have hurt top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "title": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Readies for Q4 Earnings: Is a Beat in Store?",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Mar 14. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.52 billion, which indicates an increase of almost 9% from the $3.23 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings has risen by a penny in the past 30 days to $7.48 per share, which implies an increase of nearly 12% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure. ULTA has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.8%, on average.\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nA positive view of the beauty space is keeping Ulta Beauty well-positioned. The company has been benefiting from healthy traffic trends, greater brand awareness and the expansion of its loyalty program. Management\u2019s transformational initiatives have also been yielding favorable results.\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote\n\nUlta Beauty\u2019s focus on its strategic priorities has been working well. These include strengthening the omnichannel business, undertaking various tools to enhance the experience of guests, concentrating on providing customers with a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation, deepening customer engagement by boosting rewards and loyalty programs and optimizing its cost structure.\r\n\r\nUlta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out due to consumers\u2019 rising interest in self-care and the company\u2019s focus on newness and innovation. The trend continued in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein skincare was the company\u2019s fastest-growing category. ULTA saw double-digit growth in both mass and prestige segments. The continuation of these trends bodes well for the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nUlta Beauty has been witnessing continued margin pressure due to higher supply-chain costs and reduced merchandise margins, among other reasons. Ulta Beauty\u2019s SG&A expenses have also been rising year over year for a while now. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, SG&A expenses rose 10.8% to $661.4 million due to increased corporate overheads related to strategic investments, deleverage of store payroll and benefits, increased store expenses and greater marketing expenses.\r\n\r\nThe persistence of these trends is a concern. We expect SG&A expenses to increase 11.1% in the fourth quarter, with the SG&A rate expected to expand to 24.3% compared with 23.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ulta Beauty this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\r\n\r\nUlta Beauty has an Earnings ESP of +0.05% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are three other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:\r\n\r\nDICK'S Sporting Goods DKS currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.80% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is likely to register a top and bottom-line increase when it reports fourth-quarter 2023 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings per share of $3.34 suggests a rise of almost 14% from the year-ago quarter. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for DICK'S Sporting\u2019s quarterly revenues is pegged at $3.75 billion, which indicates a jump of 4.2% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. DKS delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.8% in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nDollar General DG currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to register a bottom-line decrease when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings per share of $1.74 suggests a decrease of 41.2% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Dollar General\u2019s revenues is pegged at $9.78 billion, which calls for a decline of 4.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. DG delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.9% in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nDollar Tree DLTR currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.28% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to register top and bottom-lines increases when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings per share of $2.67 suggests a rise of 30.9% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree\u2019s quarterly revenues is pegged at $8.67 billion, which indicates an increase of 12.4% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Ulta Beauty is US$569 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$540 suggests Ulta Beauty is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for ULTA is US$552 which is 2.9% below our fair value estimate\n\nHow far off is Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty\n\nIs Ulta Beauty Fairly Valued?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$1.09b US$1.16b US$1.31b US$1.32b US$1.41b US$1.49b US$1.55b US$1.60b US$1.65b US$1.70b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x7 Analyst x4 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 3.83% Est @ 3.37% Est @ 3.04% Est @ 2.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1%  US$1.0k US$1.0k US$1.1k US$1.0k US$995 US$986 US$955 US$921 US$886 US$850\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.7b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$1.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.3%) = US$36b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$18b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$28b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$540, the company appears about fair value at a 5.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ulta Beauty as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.055. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Ulta Beauty\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.\n\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "title": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis beauty products retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $3.52 billion, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.03% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ulta?\n\nFor Ulta, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.05%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Ulta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ulta would post earnings of $4.96 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.07, delivering a surprise of +2.22%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nUlta appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, Petco Health & Wellness (WOOF) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.02 per share for the quarter ended January 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -91.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.63 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Petco has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Petco will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Stock Splits 2024: 3 Stocks That Could Follow in Walmart\u2019s Footsteps",
        "content": "Walmart (NYSE:WMT) recently surprised the market by splitting its stock 3-for-1. That means for every one WMT share you own you will now have three. The announcement was the first time in over 20 years that the retailer split its shares. More stock splits in 2024 could be coming.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know a stock split is a corporate action where a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the liquidity of the shares. Although the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific multiple, the total dollar value of the shares remains the same, meaning the split does not alter the company\u2019s market capitalization. This action often makes the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors by reducing the price per share.\n\nBecause the purpose of the split was to make its stock more affordable for Walmart employees to buy, we may see more high-priced stocks follow suit. The three companies below are ripe for stock splits in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) A digital image of a ticker tape reads \"STOCK SPLIT.\" REDU Stock stock split.\n\nSource: iQoncept/ShutterStock.com\n\nAt $554 a share, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is primed for a price cut via a stock split. The personal care and cosmetics retailer has grown to become the largest specialty beauty retailer in the U.S. with nearly 1,375 stores in all 50 states.\n\nUlta has been aggressive in returning value to shareholders. Although it doesn\u2019t pay a dividend, the beauty retailer has been repurchasing shares. After the fiscal third quarter report, Ulta said it would buy back $950 million worth of shares instead of its previous guidance of $900 million worth of shares. A stock split would make ULTA stock as attainable as its makeup.\n\nBeauty supplies tend to be resilient in both good and bad economies. An affordable luxury, consumers will continue to buy such products despite hard times. There is even a name for it: the Lipstick Effect. Because consumers can\u2019t afford to buy upscale goods they purchase smaller indulgences instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince its IPO in 2007, Ulta Beauty generated returns in excess of 1,603% versus a 239% return by the S&P 500. Bringing its stock down to an affordable luxury range would generate even greater investor interest in this high-growth company.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Stock splits, companies do exchange transactions to increase the number of shares by issuing more shares to current shareholders\n\nSource: Bakhtiar Zein / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) would be a perfect candidate for a stock split in 2024. The move would align with other tech stocks that split their shares two years ago. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) were among those splitting their stock then and the chipmaker can afford to do the same now. This makes it one of those potential stock splits for 2024.\n\nAt just under $1,400 per share, it is ready. AVGO stock is up 135% in the last 12 months and 412% over the last five years. The original Broadcom stock was founded in 1991 and split its shares on three separate occasions. It was acquired by Avago in 2016 but kept the Broadcom name (and the Avago ticker symbol). Since then, it hasn\u2019t split shares at all.\n\nThe new Broadcom has been something of a serial acquirer itself, making numerous software acquisitions over the past few years. Among those were the software businesses from CA, Symantec, and Brocade. It most recently completed its acquisition of VMWare last November.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s network and server solutions for data centers are optimized for artificial intelligence (AI). That blends well with the AI chips it is developing as well. AI is a fast-growing business and generated $1.5 billion in revenue for the company last quarter.\n\nBroadcom is well on its way toward trillion-dollar status and a stock split would make AVGO stock more accessible to all.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the cheapest stock of the three at only $415 a share but even it could split its shares. The company has nine other splits in its history, so it is not unheard of, but the last one was back in 2003. Since then, MSFT stock has grown 1,560% but including reinvested dividends would boost its total return to almost 2,600%. In comparison, the broad market index has but an 812% total return.\n\nThe company just delivered impressive second-quarter earnings. Sales surged 18% from the year-ago period to $62 billion as AI pervaded throughout all of its products and services now. CEO Satya Nadella says half of all Fortune 500 companies are using Microsoft\u2019s Azure AI models now and the cloud services platform has grown to 53,000 AI customers.\n\nMicrosoft is the richest company on the market with a $3.1 trillion valuation. It ended its fiscal second quarter with $81 billion in cash. Profits of $22 billion were up 33% from last year. This is a tech stock firing on all cylinders. Investors ought to consider MSFT stock for their portfolios, no matter if it splits its stock or not.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reached $546.54, with a -0.63% movement compared to the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.12% loss on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.25%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.41%.\n\nThe beauty products retailer's shares have seen an increase of 8.84% over the last month, surpassing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.32% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.83%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Ulta Beauty in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on March 14, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $7.48, up 11.98% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $3.52 billion, indicating an 8.95% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Ulta Beauty. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.16% higher. Ulta Beauty is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nInvestors should also note Ulta Beauty's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 20.33. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.75.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, ULTA's PEG ratio is currently 2.3. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Retail - Miscellaneous industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.37.\n\nThe Retail - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 77, this industry ranks in the top 31% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "content": "Investors interested in Retail - Miscellaneous stocks are likely familiar with ODP Corp. (ODP) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nCurrently, ODP Corp. has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Ulta Beauty has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ODP is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nODP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.18, while ULTA has a forward P/E of 20.33. We also note that ODP has a PEG ratio of 0.66. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ULTA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.30.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for ODP is its P/B ratio of 1.85. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ULTA has a P/B of 13.17.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help ODP earn a Value grade of A, while ULTA has been given a Value grade of C.\n\nODP is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that ODP is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.49 a share, just 10 days from its upcoming earnings release on March 14, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $7.49 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.48 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Ulta Beauty has an Earnings ESP of 0.05%.\n\nULTA is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Carvana (CVNA).\n\nCarvana is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 2, 2024. CVNA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.82 a share 59 days from its next earnings release.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carvana is -$0.86, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.93%.\n\nStory continues\n\nULTA and CVNA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Forget Costco. Here's a Better Retailer to Buy Right Now.",
        "content": "Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) is an excellent business, but the stock has some big drawbacks. The warehouse giant isn't very profitable, even for a retailer, due to its price-leadership selling approach. And shares are expensive, potentially limiting an investor's returns from here.\n\nIf you're shopping around in this niche but would like another option, you're in luck. There's a large, growing national retailer that's been posting double-digit profit margins, along with market-thumping customer traffic gains in recent quarters.\n\nRead on for some reasons to consider Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) shares right now.\n\nBeautiful growth\n\nThe biggest knock against Ulta Beauty these days is that the business is going through a tough growth slowdown. Comparable-store sales were up 7% in the nine months that ran through late October, down from a 16% surge in the prior year period.\n\nThe makeup and beauty care niches are more price competitive lately due to this deceleration, giving Ulta and its peers less room to hike prices. That challenge combined with softer demand growth to make 2023 an unusually weak sales year.\n\nYet Ulta is faring well despite these issues. That 7% comps increase was powered by a robust 9% customer traffic spike that was offset by a nearly 2% drop in average spending per visit. Costco, in comparison, is boosting traffic by 4% in the core U.S. market, while average spending was down 1% last quarter.\n\nHigher margins\n\nUlta is much more profitable than Costco. Sure, its operating profit margin has declined this year, slipping to 15% of sales from 17% of sales in 2022. This shift has contributed to roughly flat earnings, while most shareholders would prefer to see robust gains here.\n\nBut you'll still love the fact that Ulta's profit margin is far ahead of Costco's 3% rate. It's also well above the pre-pandemic profitability (of around 8% of sales) that investors were seeing as recently as 2019.\n\nStory continues COST Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's encouraging that this success arrived even as Ulta is facing more price-based competition and slower growth rates. Costco's management team makes it clear that the company intends to reinvest all excess cash into extending its price leadership, rather than allowing margins to rise.\n\nUlta, on the other hand, stands to see a rebound once the industry reaches a better balance between supply and demand. \"The outlook for the beauty category is bright, and I am confident Ulta Beauty has the right plans in place,\" CEO Dave Kimbell told investors in late November.\n\nThe price check\n\nCostco stock is near an all-time high and is also trading at close to its highest premium to date. That's not the case with Ulta, though. You can buy this retailer for 2.4 times sales, down from recent highs of closer to 3 times sales. Ulta is cheaper than Costco on a price-to-earnings basis, with shares trading at 21 times profit compared to Costco's elevated premium of 49.\n\nIt's true that a Costco investment delivers much more stability due to the chain's massive global sales base and the steady income that's powered by subscription fees. Yet Ulta's bright long-term growth outlook, combined with its impressive earnings power, should have investors feeling just as good about its opportunities to generate excellent returns over the next several years.\n\nIf you've found yourself waiting in vain for Costco shares to get cheaper, then maybe it's time to consider owning Ulta Beauty instead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ulta Beauty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ulta Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Ulta Beauty (ULTA). This company, which is in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this beauty products retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 2.39%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Ulta was expected to post earnings of $4.96 per share, but it reported $5.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.22%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.87 per share, while it actually produced $6.02 per share, a surprise of 2.56%.\n\nFor Ulta, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nUlta has an Earnings ESP of +0.98% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Ulta Beauty a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Ulta Beauty (ULTA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ULTA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nUlta Beauty's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Ulta Beauty's main business drivers.\n\nBolingbrook, IL-based, Ulta Beauty Inc., previously known as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., is a leading beauty retailer in the United States. Founded in 1990, the company changed its name to Ulta Beauty in January 2017.\r\n\r\nThe company offers a wide range of products including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. It sells more than 25,000 products from about 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points. We note that the company's skincare category has been standing out in particular for a while now, given consumers' rising consciousness.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the beauty products retailer also provides private label products comprising Ulta Beauty Collection branded cosmetics, skincare, and bath products. Additionally, the company operates a full-service salon in every store offering hair, skin and brow services. Additionally, it offers products through its Website, ulta.com, as well as mobile applications. The products offered by the company include the prestige and mass beauty brands.\r\n\r\nAs part of its value proposition, Ulta Beauty provides a range of loyalty programs through its Customer Relationship Management platform. It also offers frequent promotions, coupons, in-store events and gifts. The company also makes use of a range of media platforms to advertise products as well as generate awareness. The company strives to boost distribution center capabilities to better support store footfall and online demand.\r\n\r\nThe company has a strong vendor base and holds partnerships with companies such as Estee Lauder, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Shiseido. Ulta Beauty works closely with vendors to provide improved growth platforms for new and existing brands. As of the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release, Ulta Beauty operated 1,374 stores. For fiscal 2023, ULTA expects 25-30 net new stores, along with 20-30 store remodeling and relocation projects.\r\n\r\n(Note:\u00a0 Zacks identifies fiscal years by the month in which the fiscal year ends, while ULTA identifies their fiscal year by the calendar year in which it begins; so comparable figures for any given fiscal year, as published by ULTA, will refer to this same fiscal year as being the year before the same year, as identified by Zacks)\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Ulta Beauty ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in February 2014 would be worth $5,820.86, or a 482.09% gain, as of February 8, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 177.96% and gold's return of 54.29% over the same time frame.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for ULTA.\n\nUlta Beauty has outpaced the industry in the past three months. The company is benefiting from healthy traffic trends, greater brand awareness and the expansion of its loyalty program. Management is on track with transformational initiatives, which is yielding. Ulta Beauty is known for its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. These factors boosted third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and net sales increasing year over year. A positive view of the beauty space keeps the company well-positioned. However, Ulta Beauty has been witnessing continued margin pressure owing to higher supply-chain costs and reduced merchandise margins, among other reasons. The company\u2019s SG&A expenses have been rising year over year for the past few quarters.\n\nThe stock is up 6.89% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 11 best hair care stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our industry background and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at the 5 Best Hair Care Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nWhile hair care products may appear to be a modern phenomenon, their origins trace back thousands of years. Throughout history, humans have utilized various products to enhance their appearance. From homemade remedies to the thriving industry it is today, hair care and cosmetics have evolved significantly over time, reflecting both cultural practices and technological advancements.\n\nThe global hair care and beauty industries have traditionally been considered recession-resistant, as they fall within the consumer staples category, alongside essential items like groceries and cleaning supplies. In addition, given that numerous hair care and beauty brands also qualify as luxury products, the sector operates as a hybrid, blending features of consumer staples and luxury goods to provide the advantages of both. However, the COVID-19 pandemic challenged this perception. Lockdowns and consumer concerns about infection prompted widespread closures of retail and salon stores, resulting in weakened sales across the beauty and personal care product market back in 2022. In response to these challenges, industry leaders were forced to devise strategies to attract more consumers.\n\nIn 2022, the average American consumer spent approximately $86 on hair care products. Among these, shampoo emerged as the most profitable, generating sales of approximately $3.6 billion, followed by hair conditioner and hair coloring, with unit sales reaching 172 million units in the women's hair coloring category. More prevalently, hair growth treatments have gained significant attention in the beauty industry. As more consumers express interest in products that combat hair loss and thinning, the hair growth category has seen a surge in both unit and dollar sales in the United States. In 2022, dollar sales of hair growth products amounted to about $121 million. This category encompasses various product types, including oils such as rosemary oil, as well as more conventional hair care items like shampoo and conditioner, formulated with ingredients aimed at promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe evolving fashion trends and growing awareness of new, safer, and more effective hair care products have fueled a notable surge in their usage, consequently driving growth in the global hair care market. According to a market report by Fortune Business Insights, the global hair care market is forecasted to expand from $99.53 billion in 2023 to $147.49 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% during the forecast period.\n\nInvestors are increasingly turning to shares of hair care companies as a hedge against potential periods of inflation. Some of the top players in the hair care sector that serve as effective choices include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), among others listed below.

        "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Ulta Beauty, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.43 = US$1.6b \u00f7 (US$5.6b - US$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).\n\nThus, Ulta Beauty has an ROCE of 43%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Ulta Beauty's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

        "title": "How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. MercadoLibre (MELI) earns a Zacks Rank #2 20 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 22, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.38 a share.\n\nMercadoLibre's Earnings ESP sits at 10.89%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $7.38 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.66.\n\nMELI is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nUlta Beauty, which is readying to report earnings on March 14, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $7.55 a share, and ULTA is 41 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ulta Beauty is $7.48, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.97%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMELI and ULTA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "1 Growth Stock with Massive Upside Potential",
        "content": "Quality growth stocks have the potential to deliver outsized gains to long-term shareholders, especially during bull markets. It\u2019s essential to consistently identify companies growing at a higher pace compared to the overall market to benefit from massive upside potential over time.\n\nMost growth stocks trade at a premium, as investors expect a steep increase in revenue and earnings, which eventually translates to a higher valuation.\n\nOne such mid-cap growth stock is e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has already delivered outsized gains to shareholders in the last five years. e.l.f. Beauty has surged over 1,800% since January 2019 and is trading near all-time highs.\n\nDespite its market-beating gains, I expect the stock to deliver robust returns in the upcoming decade as I am bullish on the company\u2019s widening competitive moat, strong earnings growth, and recession-resistant business.\n\nAn Overview of e.l.f. Beauty\n\nValued at $8.8 billion, e.l.f. Beauty offers a portfolio of cosmetic and skin care products to consumers globally. These products are sold through a network of national and international retailers as well as direct-to-consumer.\n\ne.l.f. has a family of brands that include e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. SKIN, Well People, and Keys Soulcare. These brands can be purchased online or across leading mass market and specialty retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), allowing the company to expand distribution in the U.S. and other international markets.\n\nIts high-quality products have a universal appeal, especially among millennials and the Gen Z demographic.\n\nA Customer-Centric Marketing Model\n\ne.l.f. Beauty has deployed a consumer-centric marketing model, as the company has focused on building brand equity by driving traffic to its e-commerce platform and retail partners through digital and social media.\n\nComparatively, legacy cosmetic brands acquire customers through traditional media, such as celebrity endorsements, television ads, and magazines.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Fiscal 2023 (ended in March 2023), e.l.f. Beauty spent $126 million on marketing, which accounted for 22% of its net sales. Several of its customers active on social media write product reviews online and generate content on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, creating a social media flywheel for e.l.f. Beauty in the process.\n\nA Focus on the Supply Chain\n\ne.l.f. Beauty has successfully developed a scalable and asset-light supply chain. Its products are sourced and manufactured in China in collaboration with a network of third-party manufacturers.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty emphasizes its broad supply base provides it with the ability to fulfill product requirements and remain cost-competitive as it continues to work with suppliers on product innovation and quality.\n\nIt has two main distribution centers in California that serve national retail customers, while another distribution center in Ohio serves e-commerce demand. Further, these distribution centers are operated by a leading third-party logistics provider. It also uses third-party logistics partners in Canada and the UK to distribute products in certain international markets. e.l.f. has invested heavily in capital expenditures to automate its processes, driving its costs lower.\n\nHow Did e.l.f. Beauty Perform in Fiscal Q2 2024?\n\ne.l.f. Beauty reported revenue of $215.5 million in Fiscal Q2 2024, an increase of 76% year-over-year. Its top-line growth was driven by strong sales in retail and e-commerce channels.\n\nThe company reported a gross margin of 71% in Q2, up from 65.3% in the year-ago period, due to lower inventory, cost savings, a strong U.S. dollar, and improved transportation costs. Its operating expenses rose at a much lower pace to $112.2 million, accounting for 52% of net sales.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty reported an adjusted net income of $47.1 million or $0.82 per share in Q2, compared to a net income of $20 million or $0.36 per share in the year-ago period. Its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) more than doubled to $60.4 million in Q2, indicating a margin of 28%.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty ended the quarter with $167.8 million in cash and $57.7 million in long-term debt. Its improving profit margins have enabled e.l.f. Beauty to roughly double its balance sheet cash in the last 12 months, providing it with the flexibility to reinvest in growth and target accretive acquisitions. For instance, e.l.f. Beauty closed the acquisition of Naturium, a high-performance skincare brand, last October for $355 million.\n\nIts stellar performance in Q2 and the above-mentioned acquisition meant e.l.f. Beauty now aims to end Fiscal 2024 with sales between $896 million and $906 million, much higher than its previous mid-point revenue guidance of $797 million.\n\nIs ELF Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the 14 analysts covering ELF stock, nine recommend a Buy, five recommend a Hold, and none recommend a Sell, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average ELF stock price target is $165.85, 3.7% above the current price.\n\nAnalysts also expect ELF stock to expand its adjusted earnings to $3.22 per share in Fiscal 2025, indicating a forward P/E of 49.7x, which is steep, given that the median multiple for this sector is much lower at 17.9x.\n\nHowever, ELF stock is growing at a much faster pace compared to peers, allowing it to command a premium valuation.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nThe personal cosmetics industry is fairly recession-resistant, which should enable e.l.f. Beauty to enjoy predictable cash flows across market cycles. A lower cost base should also translate to higher margins for the company once inflation cools down.\n\ne.l.f Beauty is a digitally disruptive brand with massive upside potential, given that it\u2019s yet to gain traction in emerging economies, making it a compelling investment today.\n\nDisclosure",
