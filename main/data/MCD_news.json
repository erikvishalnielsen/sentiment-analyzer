        "title": "Chipotle's California customers are spending less after the chain upped prices due to wage hike: CFO",
        "content": "Californian burrito lovers are fed up with higher prices.\n\nWhile some thought Chipotle would be able to pass along higher costs to its loyal following once the FAST Act took effect in April, CFO Jack Hartung said customers across the industry pulled back.\n\n\"It's not because the Chipotle burrito costs a little more. There's really a reduced spending across the restaurant industry [in California],\" Hartung told Yahoo Finance, \"When we've looked at it, restaurant companies that took a very high increase had a impact on sales, about the same as what we've seen. Restaurants that have taken no increase had the same kind-of reduction in sales.\"\n\nThe FAST act mandated food chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide to raise their minimum wage for restaurant employees to $20 per hour, up from $16. As a response, Chipotle raised prices in California by 6.5% to 7% in April, Hartung said.\n\nThe \"best offense\" to combat the slowing growth in foot traffic is with \"great operations,\" Hartung said.\n\n\"It's high quality food, it's big portions, it's a fast experience, and it's the food that they crave,\" Hartung said of Chipotle's recipe to success, regardless of the macro environment. SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 01: Workers fill food orders at a Chipotle restaurant on April 01, 2024 in San Rafael, California. A new minimum wage law went into effect in California today that calls for fast food restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide to pay employees a minimum of $20 per hour at their stores in California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nIn its latest quarter, the company beat Wall Street estimates for revenue, earnings, and same store sales.\n\nFor Q3, the company expects labor cost \"to be in the low 25% range due to seasonally lower sales with wage inflation to remain at about 6%,\" Hartung told investors on the earnings call. California accounts for around 15% of Chipotle locations.\n\n\"About half of the wage inflation is due to the nearly 20% step-up in wages in California as a result of the increase in minimum wage for restaurant companies like ours that took effect in April,\" he added.\n\nFoot traffic jumped 8% in the quarter, more than the 6.3% expected, with growth across all income cohorts. That's compared to a 0.6% decline in the industry, according to a note to clients from Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo.\n\n\"Market share gains despite burger wars reinforce our view of Chipotle\u2019s enduring value superiority,\" Gargiulo wrote. \"Wth the normalization of trends and on the back of the pricing resistance encountered in California,\" Gargiulo expects fiscal year 2024 to end with 7.8% sales growth.\n\nGargiulo said the company will still be able to increase prices, if the fall return of another limited-time offering \u2014 smoked brisket \u2014 surpasses expectations, and the inflationary environment persists.\n\nStory continues\n\nHartung said this limited-time offering will likely bring in more customers, but is more expensive for the company than its current Chicken Al Pastor special.\n\nThe industry at large has been keeping tabs on the impact California's higher wages.\n\n\"We continue to see visitation trends for most QSR and fast-casual restaurant chains in California lag the national average since the implementation of the $20 minimum wage increase in the state (and subsequent menu price increases by many operators),\" R.J. Hottovy, Placer.ai's head of analytical research, told Yahoo Finance in an email.\n\nChipotle's year over year weekly foot traffic growth in California lags behind the company's national average by more than 5% since April 1, according to Placer.ai.\n\nDomino's Pizza CEO Russell Weiner told Yahoo Finance, \"We haven't had closures [in California], we haven't had to lay off our drivers, like some of our competition has, but it's a long haul, and in the short term, you're definitely going to lose orders when you increase prices.\"\n\nThe pizza chain's Q2 results \"benefitted from 1.5%\" of price increases, \"which was inclusive of high single digits [increase] in California,\" CFO Sandeep Reddy said on the earnings call.\n\nMcDonald's is set to report its Q2 earnings on Monday, July 29, but Yahoo Finance previously reported one McDonald's franchise owner that made the decision to close one location.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Savyata Mishra and Juveria Tabassum\n\n(Reuters) - The performance of McDonald's and other fast food chains' value meal launches will be closely watched when the U.S. restaurants report quarterly results over the next few weeks.\n\nMcDonald's, Burger King and other chains have been scrambling to improve traffic as soaring menu prices put off diners, especially from the lower-income group.\n\n\"The focus will be how consumers are responding to that (value and discounts) and more importantly or equally important, how long these discounts will have to go on for to get consumers back,\" said BTIG analyst Peter Saleh.\n\nIn the past few months, McDonald's extended its $5 value meal into August after its launch in June 25, while rival Burger King began offering a $5 \"Your Way Meal\" and Wendy's rolled out its $3 breakfast deal.\n\nWhile the promotions are in their early days, some analysts have said their benefit, if any, would be temporary.\n\n\"Offering value through promotion is only limited to a couple of items such as McDouble or the McChicken sandwich which are not as enticing as a let's say, a Big Mac or maybe a Whopper Junior from Burger King,\" said Danilo Gargiulo, senior analyst at Bernstein.\n\nWhile these offers were rolled out only at the end of the quarter, companies are yet to see meaningful traffic growth.\n\nFoot traffic at McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's rose 0.4%, 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively, between April and June, as per Placer.ai data.\n\nMcDonald's, set to report results on Monday, is expected to post a drop in profit for the first time in six quarters, as well as record slower growth in same-store sales from the prior three months.\n\nSame-store sales at Wendy's, scheduled to report next week, and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands, which reports on Aug. 8, are expected to slow from the levels seen last year.\n\n\"The problem in the broader sector right now, is that despite a lot being thrown at consumers, it doesn't seem to be catalysing demand that has been in a rut,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour wrote in a note.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra and Juveria Tabassum in Bengaluru; Editing by Arpan Varghese and Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "With 71% institutional ownership, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a favorite amongst the big guns",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in McDonald's implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently\n\nEvery investor in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 71% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for McDonald's  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in McDonald's. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.6% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.8% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of McDonald's\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$387m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - McDonald's has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder known for his tech innovations and philanthropic efforts, has become an important player in a surprisingly traditional sector: Fast food.\n\nAccording to an investigative report issued by NBC News, among the nearly 300,000 acres of farmland owned by the billionaire is a 14,500-acre plot in Washington state that is so vast it can be seen from space. This plot is dedicated to growing potatoes, some used to make McDonald's French fries.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWill the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing that lets you cash out whenever you want. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nAcquired beginning in 2012 through at least 22 limited liability shell companies linked to his investment group, Cascade Investments, Gates has been buying farmland in 18 states. So much farmland that, if grouped together, it would cover about 25% of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n\"My investment group chose to do this,\" Gates said in response to a Reddit user who asked him why he was buying so much U.S. farmland during an \u2018Ask Me Anything' session in 2021. \"The agriculture sector is important.\"\r\n\r\nThe connection between Gates and the fast-food giant doesn\u2019t end there. Benzinga reported that Gates is also one of the few individuals worldwide to possess a McDonald\u2019s \u201cGold Card,\u201d which grants him free meals at any of the chain\u2019s locations globally.\n\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nHowever, Gates' farmland is much more than just a supplier for the largest restaurant chain in the world. According to the report, it is used to grow soybeans, corn, cotton, carrots, rice, and onions \u2013 the same onions used in American kitchens.\r\n\r\nMore pointedly, Gates, through Cascade Investments, owns farms across various states:\n\nNorth Louisiana: 70,000 acres where farmers grow soybeans, rice, corn, and cotton. Nebraska: 20,000 acres primarily dedicated to soybean cultivation.\r\nWashington: Over 14,000 acres, including the massive potato fields used by McDonald's. Florida: Farms where carrots are grown on Gates\u2019 property.\r\nGeorgia: Initially over 6,000 acres, where farms specialized in Vidalia onions and carrots.\n\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nHis farmland empire also includes land previously owned by other billionaires, including former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nDespite the scale of Gates\u2019 farmland, farmer advocates are concerned about the impact of such large-scale acquisitions on smaller, independent farmers. With nearly 40% of U.S. farmland owned by individuals aged 65 or older, NBC News noted that deep-pocketed investors like Gates could outbid the next generation of farmers when more land becomes available.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s significant competition from non-farmers, and that really affects young farmers because it means that the price they\u2019re trying to compete with on the marketplace is driven and determined by people who are not dependent on a farming income,\u201d said Holly Rippon-Butler, former land campaigns director at the National Young Farmers Coalition.\n\nJohnathan Hladik, former policy director at the Center for Rural Affairs, noted, \"Farmers just aren\u2019t owning the assets anymore.

        "title": "How to Play McDonald's (MCD) Ahead of Q2 Earnings Release?",
        "content": "McDonald's Corporation MCD is slated to release second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 29, before the opening bell.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. However, the company\u2019s top and the bottom line increased 5% and 2% year over year, respectively.\r\n\r\nMCD surpassed earnings estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters. The average surprise over this period is 6.4%, as shown in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTrend in Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) has declined to $3.08 from $3.10 in the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 2.8% drop from the year-ago EPS of $3.17. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $6.65 billion, indicating 2.4% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model doesn't conclusively predict an earnings beat for McDonald's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of -0.67%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nFactors Influencing Q2 Performance\n\nMcDonald's top line for the second quarter is likely to have registered year-over-year growth, driven by strong digital adoption, innovative menu additions and strategic unit expansion. These factors, along with average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases, successful restaurant-level execution, effective marketing campaigns featuring the core menu and continued digital and delivery growth are likely to have aided comps. Also, the effective implementation of the Accelerating the Arches strategy bodes well.\r\n\r\nOur projections indicate a 1.8% year-over-year increase in second-quarter comparable sales. We expect U.S. and International Operated Market comps to increase 0.3% and 3.3% year over year, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe expect total company-operated sales in second-quarter 2024 to be up nearly 5.3% year over year to $2,619.1 million. Revenues from franchised restaurants are expected to be $3,997.4 million, suggesting a 1.6% rise year over year.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s second-quarter 2024 bottom line is likely to have been hurt by persistent pressure from elevated commodities and wages. A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates, is a headwind. Given the ongoing inflationary headwinds, the company expects the operating margin to be under pressure in the near term. The company expects commodity and food and paper inflation to be at the higher end in 2024. Also, it expects labor inflation to be in the high single digits.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nThe Restaurant industry has disappointed investors and MCD is no exception. Year to date, the stock has declined 14.2% compared with the industry\u2019s 10.6% drop. Other industry players like Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI, down 15.1%, Starbucks Corporation SBUX, down 22.3%, and Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, down 10.5%.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet's assess the value MCD offers to investors at its current levels.\r\n\r\nFrom the valuation point of view, the stock is trading at a discount. MCD\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stands at 19.97, lower than the industry\u2019s ratio of 21.18 and the S&P 500's ratio of 21.71. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thoughts\n\nMCD is well-positioned to benefit from its strategic initiatives, including digital growth, menu innovation and unit expansion. The company continues to expand its global footprint. The company plans to expand in Australia through new restaurant openings, leveraging its strong position. Existing restaurants will be enhanced with delivery rooms and integrated McCafe beverage cells, aiming for growth against the company.\r\n\r\nThe company continues to improve and enhance the delivery experience for its customers. This includes the addition of delivery order capabilities within the mobile app, which is available in five of its top markets. The company aims to boost the percentage of system-wide delivery sales originating from its mobile app to 30% by 2027.\r\n\r\nGiven its discounted valuation and solid growth prospects, current investors are advised to retain their holdings in McDonald's stock. New investors should be cautious of short-term challenges, including inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties. It's also crucial to closely monitor the company's performance in the upcoming earnings report.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The latest trading session saw McDonald's (MCD) ending at $253.37, denoting a -0.27% adjustment from its last day's close. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's 2.32% loss on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 1.25%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 3.64%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had lost 1.29% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.68% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.79% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of McDonald's in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on July 29, 2024. On that day, McDonald's is projected to report earnings of $3.08 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 2.84%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $6.65 billion, up 2.4% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $12.13 per share and a revenue of $26.56 billion, demonstrating changes of +1.59% and +4.17%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.51% downward. As of now, McDonald's holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, McDonald's is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.95. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.51.\n\nMeanwhile, MCD's PEG ratio is currently 2.92. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Retail - Restaurants industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.87.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 160, placing it within the bottom 37% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chipotle Q2 earnings blow past expectations, boosted by brand loyalty and value proposition",
        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) is devouring expectations, even as the restaurant industry struggles with cautious consumers.\n\nOn Wednesday after market close, the burrito chain reported earnings that beat Wall Streets' estimates across the board, including on revenue, earnings, and same-store sales.\n\nRevenue jumped 18.2% year-over-year to $2.97 billion, versus expectations of $2.94 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.34, compared to an estimate of $0.32.\n\nSame-store sales jumped 11.1% year over year, versus the 9.23% Wall Street anticipated. In Q1, same stores sales were up 7%.\n\nCEO Brian Niccol called the quarter \"outstanding,\" thanks to \"successful brand marketing\" alongside the return of the popular Chicken Al Pastor.\n\nFoot traffic jumped 8% in the quarter, more than the 6.3% expected.\n\nPrior to the report, UBS analyst Dennis Geiger called the company \"one of the best positioned concepts to sustain sales momentum in a tough macro given customer brand affinity and a solid value for the money proposition.\"\n\nBut choosier customers and value meals from fast food players like McDonald's (MCD) could pose a threat, wrote Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan in a client note.\n\n\"On the other hand, we'd rather err on the side of caution and view quick-service restaurant's aggressiveness as a near-term (even if on the margin) headwind at Chipotle, Wingstop, and Shake Shack,\" he wrote in a note to clients. SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 01: Workers fill food orders at a Chipotle restaurant on April 01, 2024 in San Rafael, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nBernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo, who has an Outperform rating and price target of $80 on the stock, wrote that there are more levers the fast-casual restaurant could pull to keep the flame burning long-term.\n\nThey include adding late-night or breakfast hours, revamping its loyalty program, and leaning into its Gen Z fans, as the demographic increasingly becomes household decision-makers.\n\nIn June, the company conducted its first 50-for-1 stock split. Shares have since fallen nearly 18% in the last month. Shares jumped roughly 14% in after-hours trading, following the earnings results.\n\nHere's what Chipotle posted in Q2 2024, compared to Bloomberg consensus data:\n\nRevenue: $2.97 billion versus $2.94 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.34 versus $0.32 Same-store sales growth: 11.1% versus 9.23%\n\nFor 2024, the company expects sales growth of mid- to high-single digits for the full year, which was up from the previous guidance of mid-single-digit growth set in Q4 of last fiscal year.\n\nChipotle ended Q2 with 3,530 stores, slightly less than the 3,540 locations anticipated. In Q2, Chipotle opened 52 new restaurants, with 46 locations featuring its drive-through Chipotlane. This year, it expects to open 285 to 315 new locations, with more than 80% of them having the drive-through concept. Long term, it plans to operate 7,000 restaurants in North America.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Domino's Pizza (DPZ) aims to win over consumers with its value proposition, regardless of the economic or political environment.\n\n\"No matter who's in the White House, no matter who's in Congress ... as long as the cards are dealt and everyone's dealt the same deck, as long as our competition and us, we've got the same parameters, I think we win,\" CEO Russell Weiner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIn Q2, Domino's US same-store sales slightly missed expectations with a 4.8% growth, compared to estimates of 4.92%.\n\nIts US company-owned businesses saw same store sales growth come in at 4.5%, versus the anticipated 6.08%. Franchisees were up 4.8%, versus the 4.87% expected. Domino's home page features a slew of ongoing value deals. (Screenshot taken by Yahoo Finance)\n\nWith ongoing deals like its $6.99 mix and match, which include various options like pizza, pasta, chicken, and desserts, or a $10.99 large 3-topping New York Style Pizza, which Weiner (a New Yorker) said is adding incremental customers, Domino's is trying to compete for dollars as eating out becomes increasingly expensive.\n\nThe company \"purposely\" raised prices when it needed to a couple of years ago, Weiner said, \"then we stopped,\" unlike many fast food competitors. Many chains are now introducing value meals to get consumers back.\n\n\"Our value is not whiplashing people, it's always been here, where it can be count on and you can get what you want,\" Weiner said, pointing to the company's growth across all income cohorts. It also posted positive growth in order counts for delivery and carryout last quarter.\n\nAs consumer confidence in the US trends lower, he expects consumers to keep coming.\n\n\"We've found ourselves during good times and bad now. As we continue to grow as a brand, we're [in a] pretty steady state through different economic times,\" Weiner said.\n\nMorningstar analyst Sean Dunlop said the company is \"pretty well positioned to compete in an environment like this.\"\n\n\"The average check for Domino's is about $22.50, you can feed somewhere between two and three people,\" he said, calling pizza as a category a \"pretty good per meal value.\"\n\nHowever, Domino's shared a pullback on international growth guidance when it reported Q2 results last Thursday. Coupled with a slight miss on its US results, its shares moved lower, down 21% in the last month alone.\n\nQ2 results \"did not live up to our elevated expectations\" Baird analyst David Tarantino wrote in a note to clients. Yet he's \"optimistic\" about the \"bigger picture,\" calling the top line results as \"fairly solid on an absolute/relative basis.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Domino's has the drivers in place to sustain standout comparable performance in upcoming periods amid an otherwise challenging macroeconomic backdrop,\" he wrote.\n\nUBS analyst Dennis Geiger said that US same store sales could potentially end the year with low-single digit growth, \"particularly in this unforgiving market.\" But the company has \"compelling catalyst path,\" with third-party delivery partnerships (like UberEats), menu innovation like New York style pizza, and gains from year two of its loyalty program.\n\nBTIG analyst Peter Saleh called the dip after earnings an opportunity to buy.\n\n\"We think Domino's is executing its domestic strategy brilliantly, gaining market share and driving traffic with all income groups, while the broader industry is struggling.\" Saleh added that \"traffic growth is a direct result of the rewards program change last year.\"\n\nAs it looks to keep prices low, Weiner is aware of new changes that could impact that ability, like higher wages in California.\n\nIt's important to note Q2 \"benefitted from 1.5%\" of price increases, \"which was inclusive of high single digits [increase] in California,\" CFO Sandeep Reddy said on the call.\n\n\"We haven't had closures [in California], we haven't had a layoff our drivers, like some of our competition has, but it's a long haul, and in the short term, you're definitely going to lose orders when you increase prices,\" Weiner said.\n\nAs repercussions of the higher wage begin to come to fruition, Yahoo Finance previously reported one McDonald's franchise owner made the decision to close one location.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Wall Street expects another robust quarter, with $2.94 billion in revenue, up 17% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.32, up 25% year over year.\n\nFoot traffic is expected to be 6.3% higher, but the average check size is only expected to grow 2.63%.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Lauren Silberman expects sales growth this quarter to be the \"highest of the year.\"\n\n\"Though traffic and same-store sales should remain strong in the second half of the year, supported by a strong innovation and marketing pipeline, while throughput remains one of the most meaningful multi-year traffic drivers,\" she wrote in a note to clients.\n\nUBS analyst Dennis Geiger called the company \"one of the best positioned concepts to sustain sales momentum in a tough macro given customer brand affinity and a solid value for the money proposition.\"\n\nBut choosier customers and value meals from fast food players like McDonald's (MCD) could pose a threat, wrote Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan in a client note.\n\n\"On the other hand, we'd rather err on the side of caution and view quick-service restaurant's aggressiveness as a near-term (even if on the margin) headwind at Chipotle, Wingstop, and Shake Shack,\" he wrote in a note to clients.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nBernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo, who has an Outperform rating and price target of $80 on the stock, wrote that there are more levers the fast-casual restaurant could pull to keep the flame burning long-term.\n\nThey include adding late-night or breakfast hours, revamping its loyalty program, and leaning into its Gen Z fans, as the demographic increasingly becomes household decision-makers.\n\nThis quarter, some on Wall Street had their eyes on portion sizes at Chipotle, like Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem, who tracked the portion size at eight Chipotle locations in New York City and ordered the same burrito bowl 75 times.\n\nOthers think the company will ride out the wave, without a hiccup.\n\n\"I don't think consumers are really going to stop going to Chipotle because they feel like their bowls are a little smaller,\" BTIG's Peter Saleh told Yahoo Finance over the phone. He said customers will likely ask for more if they want it.\n\n\"This is going to be short lived, this issue or this social media, kind-of, pushback,\" Saleh added.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q2, the company conducted its first 50-for-1 stock split. Shares have since fallen nearly 18% in the last month to nearly $53.\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from Chipotle in Q2 2024, based on Bloomberg consensus data, compared to Q2 2023:\n\nRevenue: $2.94 billion compared to $2.5 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.32 compared to $0.25 ($12.32 before stock split) Same-store sales growth: 9.23% compared to 7.4%\n\nAs of Q1, the company expects sales growth of mid- to high-single digits for the full year, which was up from the previous guidance of mid-single-digit growth.\n\nWall Street expects the company to end Q2 with a total of 3,540 locations. In Q1, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants, with 43 locations featuring its drive-through Chipotlane. This year, it expects to open 285 to 315 new locations, with more than 80% of them having the drive-through concept. Long term, it plans to operate 7,000 restaurants in North America.\n\nFollowing Q1, CEO Brian Niccol told investors the results provide \"confidence that we can achieve our long-term target of more than doubling our business in North America and expanding internationally.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Starbucks (SBUX) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?",
        "content": "Starbucks (SBUX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.93 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $9.23 billion, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.04% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Starbucks?\n\nFor Starbucks, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.12%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Starbucks will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Starbucks would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.68, delivering a surprise of -13.92%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nStarbucks appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, McDonald's (MCD) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.08 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.66 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for McDonald's has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.17%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald's will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "McDonald's (MCD) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) ended the recent trading session at $259.54, demonstrating a +0.88% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 1.08% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.32%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.58%.\n\nThe world's biggest hamburger chain's stock has dropped by 0.81% in the past month, falling short of the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.31% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.43%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of McDonald's will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on July 29, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $3.08, signifying a 2.84% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $6.66 billion, indicating a 2.55% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $12.13 per share and a revenue of $26.58 billion, demonstrating changes of +1.59% and +4.24%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for McDonald's. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.49% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. McDonald's is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nIn the context of valuation, McDonald's is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 21.22. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.49.\n\nIt is also worth noting that MCD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.96. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The average PEG ratio for the Retail - Restaurants industry stood at 1.91 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 157, placing it within the bottom 38% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "McDonald's $5 meal deal swept the internet, but franchisees may struggle from an extended run.\n\nThe promotion, originally limited to July, will be available all summer. Per a memo obtained by Yahoo Finance, 93% of all McDonald's restaurants voted yes to extend the $5 meal deal through August.\n\nThe company's US chief marketing officer, Tariq Hassan, said the deal successfully drove foot traffic back from competitors and boosted the brand's affordable image after several price hikes. Customers drawn in by the deal may try other pricier items too.\n\nWhen the offering rolled out formally on June 25, foot traffic was down 0.8% that week year over year, per Placer.ai. Traffic was subsequently up 2.8% the week of July 1 and up 2.4% the week of July 8, compared to last year.\n\n\"It does look like incremental visits are coming in because of this,\" R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe deal is \"resonating with that lower-income consumer,\" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh told Yahoo Finance, though more data is needed to gauge its effectiveness.\n\nSaleh thinks it may be extended to September as the new national value platform, while the Golden Arches figures out other launches like buy one, get one, or a version of the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu.\n\n\"This is kind of their bridge to that value menu,\" Saleh said prior to the extension announcement. He added that franchisees are learning that the $5 deal, which consists of a choice of McDouble burger or McChicken sandwich, four-piece chicken McNuggets, small fries, and a small soft drink, is \"too narrow\" and \"doesn't allow the customer to have a ton of variety.\"\n\nThe meal deal could have implications for value offerings across the industry.\n\nMcDonald's is the \"dominant player ... Anything they do is gonna have a big ripple effect,\" Hottovy said, especially as grocery stores and casual dining chains like Cava (CAVA), Chipotle (CMG), and Sweetgreen (SG) offer customers competitive alternatives. McDonald's restaurant in Manhattan, New York City, on July 16, 2024. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBut in some ways, the meal may be working against franchisees in the early innings.\n\nSo far, franchisees said 20% to 25% of transactions have included the deal, which is \"way higher than historical [and] way higher than what McDonald's would typically want,\" according to Saleh. Customers that were already going to McDonald's are turning to the discounted meal too.\n\n\"That's definitely not all incremental. These aren't new customers. Some of these customers are existing customers that were going to come anyway,\" Saleh said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTypically, 10%-15% of customers use discounted deals, according to Hottovy.\n\nPlus, 20% of customers ordering the $5 meal deal are using an additional 20% off digital coupon from the app. Its usage is \"much higher than what McDonald's had expected it to be\" too.\n\n\"Franchisees are telling us that ... their margins are being impacted by [the deal], and it's making this a lot less profitable, or in certain cases, not profitable at all,\" Saleh said. Some franchisees are pulling back on marketing for the deal, like video ads on the in-store screen or signage on the windows.\n\nOthers are making the threshold to get 20% off higher.\n\n\"Some markets were at $5 and some were at $10 ... almost all, or many, have gone above the $10 mark,\" per Saleh.\n\nThis comes as the company is set to report its earnings on Tuesday, July 29.\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from McDonald's in Q2, per Bloomberg consensus data, compared to Q2 of 2023, when the Grimace Shake stole the show:\n\nRevenue: $6.64 billion compared to $6.5 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $3.08 compared to $3.17 Global same-store sales growth: 0.94% compared to 11.7%\n\nUS same-store sales growth: 1.06% compared to 10.3% International owned same-store sales growth: 1.97% compared to 11.9% International franchised same-store sales growth: -3.8% compared to 14%\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Analysts Estimate McDonald's (MCD) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for",
        "content": "The market expects McDonald's (MCD) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis world's biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.8%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $6.66 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.53% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald's?\n\nFor McDonald's, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.28%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald's will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that McDonald's would post earnings of $2.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.70, delivering a surprise of -0.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nMcDonald's doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $350.32 million, up 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for BJ's Restaurants has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 9.25%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that BJ's Restaurants will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Chipotle Mexican Grill vs. Cava Group",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is probably best known for its assembly line-style fresh food preparation. Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) has also built its foundation on the same concept, but with the distinction that Chipotle focuses on Mexican food while Cava specializes in Mediterranean fare. The latter, of course, is a much smaller chain, which makes the comparison with Chipotle extra interesting. Which is a better investment right now?\n\nChipotle is a huge success story\n\nEvery restaurant chain starts from modest beginnings, but not every restaurant chain can grow to have 3,500 locations like Chipotle. Sure, McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) and Yum! Brands'(NYSE: YUM) Taco Bell are both much larger, but they've also been around for a lot longer than Chipotle. Chipotle, in fact, has only been a public company since 2006, when it held its initial public offering. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBy just about any measure, Chipotle is a standout in the restaurant sector today. And the chain continues to execute at a high level, with first-quarter sales rising a huge 14.1% and same-store sales, which looks at sales for locations open for at least a year, up a very impressive 7%. That speaks to a management team that is firing on all cylinders, operating its current fleet at a high level, which is captured in the same-store number, while also adding new locations that boost overall sales.\n\nThere's a reason why Chipotle's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 60. While that's below the five-year average of around 70, it is still quite high on an absolute basis. Investors are paying up for a fairly large company that they expect to keep growing strongly.\n\nThat's entirely possible, but growth becomes more and more difficult to achieve the larger you get. It's a numbers game. Adding one restaurant when you own only one restaurant is a 100% increase in the store base. But the third location is only a 50% increase. The more restaurants you add, the slower the expansion rate becomes. Still, for more conservative investors looking to invest in growth stocks, Chipotle's proven success will be very compelling. Just go in knowing you are paying a big premium, noting that McDonald's P/E is only 22 and its five-year average P/E is 27.\n\nCava is all about the potential\n\nBy comparison, Cava is a tiny little restaurant chain with just 320 or so locations. But it opened 14 new sites in the first quarter of 2024. All told, the store base grew a huge 22% year over year! That's a number that would be almost unthinkable for Chipotle, which speaks to the opportunity ahead for Cava.\n\nStory continues\n\nCava is coming off of a very strong run. In 2023 its sales increased nearly 60% and its same-store sales rose by almost 18%. Those just aren't sustainable figures and they will probably make 2024 results look a bit less exciting because the company will be comparing against truly astounding growth figures. For example, first-quarter 2024 sales \"only\" rose 30% or so while same-store sales were up just 2.3%. Obviously, 30% sales growth is still very strong, but the 2.3% same-store figure is respectable for a fast-food company, though nowhere near as enticing as 18%.\n\nBut if Cava can keep expanding its store count and just maintain that low-single-digit same-store sales growth, it will still be a very fast-growing restaurant chain. And that, in a nutshell, is the investment thesis. There's one small problem, though. Cava is a very young company, having only held its IPO in mid-2023. Given that the P/E ratio is a massive 225, investors are clearly pricing in a lot of success in the years ahead (and probably looking at Chipotle to gauge its long-term potential). If the company lives up to expectations, it could be well worth the price and risk. If not, well, Wall Street is littered with restaurants that have crashed and burned.\n\nThe bottom line: There's more long-term growth opportunity with Cava than there is with Chipotle. But that opportunity is far from certain, which will make Cava most appropriate for aggressive growth investors.\n\nCava vs. Chipotle: Which one wins?\n\nThere are a few simple answers here and some more complex ones. For example, neither Chipotle nor Cava pay a dividend, so don't buy either if you are an income investor. And given the lofty P/E ratios, value investors may want to pass as well. But if you are a growth investor, you might find each of them of interest.\n\nThe difference is going to be whether you want to pay up in a big way for potential growth from a company with a short operating history or pay up in a more modest way for potential growth from a company with a solid track record of expanding over time. Or, to put it another way, most growth investors will probably find Chipotle more interesting while those looking to swing for the fences will likely be more attracted to Cava.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Index is made up of 30 of the largest, publicly traded companies trading on either the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq. These companies are known as blue-chip stocks to buy for their ability to deliver stable, reliable performance no matter what\u2019s going on in the economy.\n\nThese stocks are part of many institutional portfolios. In fact, if you own a mutual fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), you own more than one of these blue-chip stocks.\u00a0However, when choosing individual stocks to own, retail traders and investors may stay away from these stocks in favor of companies that offer stronger growth potential.\n\nThat was the case in 2023 and has continued in 2024. Investors flocked into tech stocks and particularly artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. However, there are signs that the current market rally is likely to expand beyond the Magnificent 7. And with a two-day rally that sent the Dow stocks up over 900 points, it\u2019s likely that investors are looking for blue-chip stocks to buy like the ones listed here.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) An image of the Caterpillar tractor brand logo.\n\nFirst up on this list of blue-chip stocks to buy is Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). The manufacturer and supplier of heavy machinery has been a major beneficiary of the $1.2 trillion that is still being released into the economy through the Infrastructure Act of 2021.\n\nThat spending drove investor interest and pushed CAT stock up nearly 40% in the last 12 months. So why is the stock considered a bargain? For starters, the Federal Reserve is now widely expected to cut interest rates, possibly as early as September. That is likely to spur another round of infrastructure spending, this time fueled by the private sector.\n\nPlus, the\u00a0stock had a pullback of nearly 15% from peak to trough after its first quarter earnings report. At that time, revenue came in about flat year-over-year which gave investors a good reason to take a breather.\n\nCaterpillar also recently increased its dividend for the 30th consecutive year. The increase of 8.4% was larger than the company\u2019s three-year average growth rate of 6.6%. And with a payout ratio of around 23%, that dividend growth looks like it will extend well into the future.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough year to own McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock. \u00a0And to be fair, the company has been guilty of some self-inflicted wounds. It\u2019s been a beat or two slow to recognize the impact that inflation was having on its core customer base.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, some of the talk about the company\u2019s pricing needs to be taken with a grain of salt. McDonald\u2019s business model allows franchisees to set their own pricing depending on their location. So for every social media tweet about $15 Big Mac\u2019s (I\u2019m exaggerating), many consumers can find the prices to be inflation adjusted, but competitive with other fast-food options.\n\nBut what about the price that matters to investors, the stock price? MCD stock is down 13% in 2024 and the stock recently was trading at its 52-week low. But as investors look for blue-chip stocks to buy, they seem to be agreeing that McDonald\u2019s is offering value.\n\nAnd as Nikolaos Sismanis wrote for InvestorPlace, investors are undoubtedly announcing that McDonald\u2019s has delivered 13 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth. And even if that growth is weaker than in the past, growth is still growth.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a different company than the one that reached an all-time high in 2022. The company spun off its consumer products division into a new company, Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE). And earlier this year, the company brought its long-standing talc lawsuit to an end.\n\nSo it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s taken investors a little time to figure out just what type of company they own. The answer is a company that is becoming a leader in the development of innovative medicine and medical technology.\n\nIn the area of innovative medicine, Johnson & Johnson has a robust pipeline that includes many oncology drugs including advancing several novel therapies. And the company is making strategic acquisitions to solidify its position in MedTech.\n\nInvestors are taking notice and the company\u2019s second quarter earnings report delivered on July 17 will do nothing to steer them away. The company came in light on revenue year-over-year but easily beat analysts\u2019 estimates. Its earnings beat analysts\u2019 estimates and were also higher year-over-year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in MCD.

While the rise of this area of tech may be a secondary catalyst for each of these edge computing stocks, it may just well contribute to them being multibaggers in the years ahead.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThanks to the AI boom, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has already become a multibagger stock. Since the start of 2023, shares in this cloud networking solutions provider have nearly tripled in price. After reaching a record high earlier this month, ANET has pulled back. Investors now may be concerned that the stock has peaked.\n\nHowever, while concerns about another \u201cAI bubble\u201d are rising, much suggests that ANET stock could keep on climbing, thanks to its high exposure to the overall GenAI trend. In particular, in areas like edge computing. Edge computing may not be Arista\u2019s main business, but outsized growth of this segment may help to drive overall growth for the company.\n\nThe edge computing industry grows as expected, at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.9% between now and 2030. This, alongside other factors, may enable Arista to hit the top end of earnings forecasts over the next few years. The high end of sell-side earnings for Arista in 2026 currently come in at around $12 per share. That represents a 60% increase compared to analyst consensus for this year.\u00a0With all of this in mind, consider ANET one of the top edge computing stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) are another great vehicle for adding exposure to the edge computing growth trend. Alphabet is of course already considered one of the top stocks to own for exposure to the generative AI growth trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne Alphabet segment that especially stands to benefit from the rise of GenAI is Google Cloud. Via its Google Distributed Cloud service, this public cloud is a leading provider of edge computing services to large companies like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), as well as governmental agencies like the U.S. Department of Defense. Much like with ARET, the rise of edge computing alone may not be what leads to multibagger gains for GOOG stock in the years ahead.\n\nRather, growth in this segment, coupled with growth in Alphabet\u2019s search, streaming, and other major business segments, may result in a level of growth sufficient to send shares to prices many times that of current levels. According to the latest sell-side forecasts, GOOG could generate earnings topping $10 per share during 2026. Meeting or beating these high-end forecasts, combined with some multiple expansion, could result in shares trading at double current prices two years from now.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) could be another winning edge computing stock in the making. Based on recent results, HPE has been experiencing weak revenue growth and declining profitability. Even so, analysts like Argus\u2019 Jim Kelleher are bullish that the technology hardware company will soon benefit from the AI growth trend.\n\nBack in June, Kelleher upgraded HPE stock from \u201chold\u201d to \u201cbuy,\u201d based on this thesis. Per the analyst, existing business lines for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, such as edge-to-cloud data, could return to growth mode going forward. The company is also well-positioned to capitalize on the ever-increasing demand for AI hardware. Kelleher\u2019s price target for HPE is $26 per share. That\u2019s around 23.8% above current prices.\n\nBetter yet, the potential long-term upside with HPE could be even more significant. If the growth trends like AI and edge computing prove to benefit the company more significantly than expected, not only could shares rise on earnings growth. This stock, currently trading at a low 10.9 times forward earnings, may experience a bump up in valuation. Even a move to a mid-teens multiple, coupled with double-digit earnings growth, could be enough to send shares to prices double that of present levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Volatility Insurance",
        "content": "The concept of safe stocks arguably couldn\u2019t be timelier. Recently, the technology sector encountered significant turmoil, with many experts questioning the sustained success of artificial intelligence and related innovations. Some of the most popular large-capitalization equities tumbled, which in some sense could bode well for boring but established players.\n\nIt\u2019s the common tortoise and the hare theme. While growth-focused tech firms have witnessed blistering returns, the issue is that a significant portion of the returns seen in the equities space have come from only a handful of entities. Such a situation might not last indefinitely.\n\nFurther, investors that have gotten used to consistent outsized earnings beats may be getting restless: they want bigger and better. However, with the tech powerhouses already at the top of their game, it\u2019s difficult to extract additional improvements.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the other hand, boring ideas that quietly go about their business may be relatively undervalued. If sentiment rotates back toward a risk-off profile, the below safe stocks may benefit.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the top tech juggernauts, it\u2019s also one of the safe stocks to buy. Offering a diverse range of solutions, from business software to computer hardware to big investments in AI, Microsoft does it all. And yes, MSFT has been looking a bit shaky in recent sessions. However, over the long run, the red ink could be a discounted opportunity.\n\nWhat stands out regarding MSFT is the underlying consistency. Between the second quarter of last year to Q1 2024, Microsoft posted an average earnings per share of $2.82. This figure beat the collective consensus view of $2.64, yielding an earnings surprise of 7%. In the trailing 12 months (TTM), the tech giant posted EPS of $11.53 on sales of $236.58 billion.\n\nOne concern is that MSFT is a pricey with a trailing-year sales premium of 14.19X. However, it\u2019s worth noting that between Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, the market accepted a premium of 12.13X.\n\nMore importantly, analysts anticipate a 15.6% jump in sales to $244.93 billion. Fiscal 2025 revenue could rise to $280.07 billion. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the safe stocks you can likely trust.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nA fast-food icon, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. However, investors might be concerned about its status as one of the safe stocks. After all, younger consumers have shown a penchant for health-conscious choices. That doesn\u2019t exactly fit with the Golden Arches\u2019 motif. At the same time, there\u2019s always room for cheap eateries, especially in this economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the concerns, McDonald\u2019s has been a consistent performer. Admittedly, the company encountered a slight hiccup in Q1 2024. Still, in the past four quarters, the average EPS came out to $2.96. This handily beat the collective consensus view of $2.79, yielding an earnings surprise of 5.93%. For the TTM period, EPS reached $11.77 on sales of $25.76 billion.\n\nIn the past year, the market priced MCD stock at a sales multiple of 8.64X. That\u2019s significant because right now, shares trade hands at 7.29X. Looking out to the end of the year, experts believe EPS may rise 9.15% to $12.17. Revenue could see a bump up of 11.7% to $26.61 billion. In fiscal 2025, sales could see another decent swing to $28.11 billion.\n\nCombined with a forward yield of 2.56%, McDonald\u2019s is one of the safe stocks to buy.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nAs one of the biggest names in the consumer products segment, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) makes an organic case for safe stocks. In many ways, you really can\u2019t go wrong with P&G. No, it\u2019s not the most exciting enterprise \u2013 not even close. However, the company provides the everyday products that households use. Therefore, P&G enjoys a level of business predictability that other enterprises can only dream about.\n\nEven better, this predictability shows up in the financials. In the past four quarters, the consumer goods giant posted an average EPS of $1.64. This performance beat the average consensus view of $1.54. Further, the underlying average earnings surprise landed at 6.55%. In the TTM period, P&G posted EPS of $6.12 on sales of $84.06 billion.\n\nRight now, shares trade at a sales premium of 4.91X. Relative to the 4.42X that P&G printed in the past year, the premium lift isn\u2019t that bad. Further, context is important. Analysts believe revenue may rise 2.8% to $84.32 billion by year\u2019s end. By fiscal 2025, sales could march up to $87.02 billion, up 3.2%. Combined with a forward yield of 2.38%, PG deserves to be included among safe stocks to buy.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) Close up of Abbott Laboratories sign at their headquarters in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in North Chicago, Illinois, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) operates in the medical devices industry. Together with its subsidiaries, Abbott discovers, develops, manufactures and sells healthcare products worldwide. It offers significant relevancies in multiple treatment areas. Not to sound cynical but Abbott is also a top provider of diabetes management. With chronic diseases and conditions rising, Abbott will likely \u201cenjoy\u201d robust tailwinds.\n\nAs with the other safe stocks on this list, Abbott\u2019s optimistic case doesn\u2019t just revolve around narratives; rather, it consistently and quietly delivers financial results. In the past four quarters, Abbott posted an average EPS of $1.10. Analysts during the period anticipated a consensus view of $1.07. This performance yielded an earnings surprise of 2.43%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Abbott posted EPS of $3.21 on sales of $40.33 billion. Enticingly, ABT stock trades hands at 4.45X trailing-year sales. Between the Q1 period of 2023 and 2024, this metric landed at 4.54X. What\u2019s more, analysts believe that sales in fiscal 2024 may rise 4.1% to $41.74 billion. And fiscal 2025 could see the top line expand to $44.78 billion.\n\nAdd in a forward yield of 2.1% and you have one of the safe stocks to buy.\n\nJohnson Controls (JCI) A sign for a Johnson Controls location showing the logo and address of the company.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the build products and equipment industry, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) engages in engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and retrofitting building products and systems. It\u2019s hardly what you call a riveting business, focusing on rather mundane services such as heating, ventilation and building management. Still, as society normalizes from the Covid-19 pandemic, entities like Johnson Controls could steadily march higher.\n\nAdmittedly, JCI presents a slightly riskier idea among safe stocks. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 84 cents. However, this figure fell just short of the consensus view of 85 cents. What triggered the red ink was an earnings miss in Q3, with JCI falling roughly 4% below expectations. Still, its Q1 2024 performance was relatively solid, thus encouraging onlookers.\n\nIn the TTM period, Johnson Controls posted EPS of $2.47 on sales of $26.83 billion. Covering experts see EPS rising 2.29% to $3.58 by year\u2019s end. Also, revenue could march up 3.3% to $27.68 billion. In the following year, EPS could gain robustly to $4.08 on sales of $29.01 billion.\n\nThanks to a forward yield of 2.12%, JCI is another quality idea for safe stocks to buy.\n\nPublic Storage (PSA) a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildings\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nStructured as a real estate investment trust or REIT, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) acquires, develops, owns and operates self-storage facilities. Fundamentally, the company could benefit from broader demographic trends. Mainly, baby boomers are looking to downsize while keeping heirlooms for the next generation. That suits PSA\u2019s business model perfectly. Also, younger people may take advantage of self-storage to trade down themselves due to the high cost of rent.\n\nIn the past four quarters, Public Storage posted an average EPS of $2.75. This tally beat the collective consensus view of $2.73. However, the REIT did incur a sizable earnings miss in Q4. Nevertheless, because of the robust performance overall in the past year, the earnings surprise came out to 0.83%. During the TTM period, the entity posted EPS of $11 on revenue of $4.61 billion.\n\nInterestingly, PSA stock trades at 11.76X sales. In the past year, this metric landed at 11.73X; thus, the current premium isn\u2019t that high relative to what the market readily accepts. Plus, analysts are looking for growth of 3.9% in the top line to $4.69 billion.\n\nAdd in the generous forward yield of 3.87% and PSA looks more attractive.\n\nWaste Management (WM) person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR\n\nWhen it comes to safe stocks to buy, it doesn\u2019t get much safer than Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Good economy or not, people are always going to throw stuff away. Well, based on the laws of physics, that stuff has to go somewhere \u2013 typically in a landfill. So, WM benefits from a permanently relevant narrative.\n\nEven better, the company is delivering the goods because why wouldn\u2019t it? Again, the trash has to go somewhere. In the past four quarters, Waste posted an average EPS of $1.66. This figure beat the consensus view of $1.55, resulting in an earnings surprise of 7.43%. Notably, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 saw an average beat of 15.2%.\n\nIn the TTM period, WM posted EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $20.69 billion. By year\u2019s end, analysts project that EPS may shoot up 18.26% to $7.32. On the top line, sales may expand by 5.6% to $21.58 billion. In fiscal 2025, earnings may rise to $8.08 per share on revenue of $23.36 billion.\n\nLastly, it offers a forward yield of 1.34%. All in all, WM should help keep your portfolio on the straight and narrow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search McDonald's Corporation (MCD): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which McDonald's falls in, has lost 5.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share, indicating a change of -2.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $12.14 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.13 indicates a change of +8.2% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MCD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.67 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.59 billion and $28.19 billion estimates indicate +4.3% and +6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $2.70 for the same period compares with $2.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.01%. The EPS surprise was -0.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, McDonald's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If You Can Only Buy One Blue-Chip Stock in July, It Better Be One of These 3 Names",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high of 40,720.64 on July 15. Despite the new record, the 30 blue-chip stocks that make up the index are only up 8% in 2024, less than half the S&P 500.\n\nGone are the days when investors considered these 30 Dow stocks the best investments you could own for the long haul. Technology certainly has had something to do with the changing of the guard. The same could be said for consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nToday\u2019s blue chips are not necessarily the Dow 30. They\u2019re stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with growth potential for years, if not decades, to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, if you buy blue-chip stocks in July, it should be one of these three alternatives to Dow 30 stocks. Each operates in the same sector as the three Dow 30 stocks, with better prospective returns over the long haul.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinviz.com considers Costco (NASDAQ:COST) part of the consumer defensive sector. Others would say \u201cconsumer staples.\u201d That\u2019s neither here nor there. It is my blue-chip stock to buy as an alternative to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nJames Quincey became the CEO of Coca-Cola in January 2017 after 11 years at the company. In the past 7.5 years, he\u2019s been the beverage company\u2019s top leader, and its shares have appreciated by 54%. COST stock returned 427% in the same period, nearly eight times Coca-Cola\u2019s performance.\n\nI\u2019m a long-time Costco shopper. Its recent announcement that it would raise the annual membership fee Sept. 1 to $65 for its individual Gold Star and business members in the U.S. and Canada. Its premium memberships in the U.S. and Canada will rise to $130.\n\nThe stock fell on the news.\n\nHowever, considering it hasn\u2019t raised the membership fee since 2017 and is about two years past the five-year historical average, I\u2019m not sure how members or investors can be negative about the action taken.\n\nCostco has always been about providing consumers with the lowest prices possible, generating most of its profits from membership fees. Compared to beverage companies Coke and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), which have gone hog wild on price increases over the past two years, Costco has held its prices steady.\n\nIt\u2019s a much better blue-chip stock.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is considered part of the consumer cyclical sector by Finviz.com. Others would say \u201cconsumer discretionary.\u201d It is one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy as an alternative to McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD).\n\nFirst, if you want to own a restaurant stock, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG) would be a better choice given its pricing power, but I digress.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn May, the company reported Q1 2024 results that included earnings per share of 93 cents, 22.4% higher than a year ago and five cents better than analyst expectations. Revenue increased by 5.9% year-over-year to $12.48 billion. However, some investors focused on the 3.0% same-store sales growth in the quarter, 70 basis points less than the Wall Street consensus.\n\nFor the second quarter, it sees an EPS of 89 cents at the midpoint of guidance, five cents shy of analyst expectations. One analyst, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe, sees this as a case of \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe guidance remains conservative, and continue to see a favorable buying environment for [TJX\u2019s stock],\u201d MarketWatch reported Tarlowe\u2019s comments to clients.\n\nAs McDonald\u2019s prices have risen, the restaurant chain has struggled to keep low-income customers buying its products. TJX is the better blue-chip stock to buy.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is part of the communication services sector. I\u2019m making a controversial call by selecting it as a better blue-chip stock to buy than Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).\n\nThat\u2019s especially true since the social media platform\u2019s stock struggled in the past month, down over 7%. However, over the past five years, despite underperforming relative to the index, PINS stock gained 59%, 89 percentage points better than Disney.\n\nFurther, with the country divided, it\u2019s about the only social media platform whose user interactions aren\u2019t completely unhealthy and uncalled for. It\u2019s very good for the future. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIn Q1 2024, its earnings jumped 150%. FactSet estimates suggest that they\u2019ll rise 32% YOY in Q2, 23% in Q3 and 19% for Q4, with revenue growth over this period of 19.5% per quarter.\n\n\u201c\u2018Thanks to our investments in AI (artificial intelligence) and shopability, we\u2019re driving even greater returns for advertisers and gaining access to performance budgets,\u2019 said Bill Ready, Pinterest CEO, in its earnings recent report. The company generates revenue from online ads,\u201d Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported.\n\nI might be an outlier, but I believe its stock will outperform Disney over the next five years like it did the past five. That makes it a top blue-chip stock to buy in July.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Insiders At McDonald's Sold US$7.6m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "Over the past year, many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman & CEO, Christopher Kempczinski, sold US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$280 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$257. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nInsiders in McDonald's didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this freelist of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nMcDonald's Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that McDonald's insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$383m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About McDonald's Insiders?\n\nInsiders haven't bought McDonald's stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that McDonald's is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with McDonald's and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 17, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), McDonald's Corp. MCD and American Express Co. AXP, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. SPLP.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analysts for Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald's and American Express\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc., McDonald's Corp. \u00a0and American Express Co., as well as a micro-cap stock Steel Partners Holdings L.P. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the year-to-date period (+21.8% vs. +19.9%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\r\n\r\nMcDonald's shares have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-14.8% vs. -12.4%). The company is witnessing macroeconomic challenges and commodity and wage inflation are primary headwinds. Earnings estimates for 2024 have declined in the past 60 days, depicting analysts' concern regarding the stock growth potential.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, McDonald\u2019s is likely to benefit from marketing campaigns, unit expansion and a loyalty program. McDonald\u2019s is increasing its focus on menu innovation, as it believes that the strengthening of the core menu and solid marketing are likely to pave the way for additional growth in the upcoming periods.\r\n\r\nAlso, emphasis on Accelerating the Arches strategy bodes well. McDonald\u2019s expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth over the long term.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on McDonald\u2019s here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+39.3% vs. +13.0%). The company\u2019s growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues.\r\n\r\nConsumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.\r\n\r\nHowever, with higher utilization of the firm\u2019s cards, costs in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to go up. Rising marketing costs are straining its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. The stock is overvalued at the moment. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)\r\n\r\nSteel Partners' shares have underperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (-3.8% vs. +9.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $734.16 million have seen EBITDA margin declined from 14.2% to 12.3% in the first quarter of 2024 due to an underperformance in the Energy and Diversified Industrial segments. Energy revenues fell 33.7% and Diversified Industrial sales decreased 3.9%, impacting profitability. Also, fluctuations due to geopolitical tensions impact operational costs and investor confidence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Steel Partners' revenues rose 7% year over year to $476.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, driven by a consolidation in its supply chain and an 18.5% rise in Financial Services revenues.\r\n\r\nWith a diversified portfolio across various sectors and the inclusion of Steel Connect, SPLP mitigates risks and boosts growth. As of Mar 31, 2024, SPLP had $273.9 million in cash, with debt reduced to $92.8 million. SPLP also reduced interest expenses by 76.7% in the first quarter.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Restaurant Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Food is a way for us to connect\u2013 from the first date to celebrating our lives\u2019 most important moments, a sit-down meal always carries significance. While food prices have risen across the board\u2013 with increases being even more painful for those who frequently eat out, consumer spending in this sector hasn\u2019t seen much of a hit. Each month, spending amounts to between $94-95 billion, which indicates that while some volatility is still present, people aren\u2019t willing to give up their special moments just yet.\n\nHowever, concerns about consumers becoming fed up with high prices have become key issues for many companies, with companies from McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) to Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) releasing new \u201cvalue\u201d meals. However, the companies presented today don\u2019t have to do this as they are either diversified in the fast food space, or sit-down restaurants, which can raise prices with less criticism.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three restaurant stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYum! Brands (YUM) YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nYum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) is a conglomerate specializing in quick-service restaurants. Its subsidiaries include KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, among other companies. This diversified portfolio has led YUM to gain a great foothold in the restaurant sector. It also has multiple international segments, which contribute heavily to its growth.\n\nEarnings-per-share (EPS) predictions are trending downward, with analysts predicting an EPS of 5.67 until the end of the year, down from the 5.79 predicted 90 days ago. This is in line with growth predictions, which suggest a downtrend this year and a rebound next year. Analysts are predicting an annual growth rate of 11.10% over the next five years at the moment. It\u2019s reported that the company has a growth potential of around 14%, which further solidifies its \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\n\nWhile having it may have missed earnings estimates in Q1 2024, YUM has some great fundamentals. The fragmentation of its subsidiaries across various countries has led the company to see impressive growth in certain regions. This is especially true with KFC in the Latin America/India regions, which posted growth of 22% and 12% respectively in Q1. YUM is also expanding rapidly, with the addition of 808 new units globally, further adding to potential revenue. Thus, YUM is a restaurant stock to buy.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) is a leading chain steakhouse. It falls in the \u201ccasual-dining\u201d space, with stores in the U.S. and internationally. While this isn\u2019t a big international chain restaurant, TXRH remains one of the favorite restaurant stocks to buy now for analysts, with a proposed growth potential of 2.77% for this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTXRH\u2019s financials look amazing; profit margins, return on assets and equity, operating margins etc. are all above sector averages. TXRH saw quarterly revenue growth of 12.50% as of Q1 2024. This corresponded with a quarterly earnings growth of 31%. Such discrepancies are normal and are likely due to the fact that as revenue grows, the costs related to obtaining that revenue generally go down.\n\nThere are notable risks to TXRH. High beef prices will strike this chain hard due to its steak-centric menu. However, this could be a double-edged sword. Being a mid-priced steakhouse, it is poised to poach consumers who would likely go to fancier restaurants but were priced out. This is already starting to take place, with popular Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) posts talking about TXRH\u2019s great value popping up. Additionally, several investment advisory firms, as well as multiple banks rate TXRH a \u201cbuy\u201d stock, making a stronger case for it.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) the cheesecake factory logo on one of its restaurants\n\nSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) is an iconic restaurant chain that operates exclusively in North America. The company also has several subsidiaries, including Flower Child and North Italia. This company is a great value and long-term pick.\n\nWhile CAKE doesn\u2019t have current growth catalysts, the company\u2019s financials makes it clear why CAKE is a buy. While a profit margin of 3.07% is within the sector average, a return on equity of 33.69% is unprecedented. This is important for investors, as the return on equity is a measure of not only the company\u2019s profitability, but also its efficiency in growing shareholder value.\n\nCAKE saw YOY revenue growth of 2.9% last quarter, with earnings going up 18.3%. This exceeded analyst expectations by 7.3%, which is a significant jump. This trend appears to be long-term, however. Analysts have raised EPS predictions for both 2024 and 2025, predicting growth at 15.25% annually over the next five years. Should CAKE meet this, its stock will soar\u2013 taking your investment with it.

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at a 52-Week Low in July",
        "content": "While all major indexes continue to reach new highs, including the Dow exceeding 40,000 points for the first time last week, many notable stocks have surprisingly failed to keep up with the rally. It\u2019s quite unexpected to see that among these underperformers are blue-chip stocks, companies recognized for their overall quality, stability, and reliable growth.\n\nWhile the sell-offs in these stocks may be partially justified due to market conditions and company-specific challenges, they also likely present attractive opportunities. Despite the broader market\u2019s exuberance, these overlooked blue-chip stocks now trade near their 52-week lows, offering potential value plays for those looking to capitalize on temporary weaknesses.\n\nIn this article, I will present three blue-chip stocks recently overlooked by the market. Their recent downturn may look alarming, though all three stocks exhibit robust fundamentals and promising outlooks. This setup makes them attractive buys for investors seeking quality additions to their portfolios at a discount.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) appears to be one of the most compelling blue-chip stocks to consider, given its recent underperformance. The quick-service restaurant giant, boasting over 41,000 locations worldwide, has seen its shares fall by about 14.5% in 2024, lagging behind the broader market, which has recorded considerable gains over the same period.\n\nThe stock\u2019s sell-off stems from market concerns over affordability, with fast-food prices increasing due to higher costs of food ingredients and labor. These are somewhat valid worries, as the company has experienced a modest slowdown, with same-store sales rising by just 1.9% in its most recent Q1 report.\n\nThat said, assessing McDonald\u2019s performance through another lens tells a different story. Specifically, Q1 marked the 13th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. A temporary pause from McDonald\u2019s usual mid-single-digit growth rates is understandable, while the fact that same-store sales continue to grow from already high levels is fantastic.\n\nAfter its recent dip, MCD stock trades at just 20.8X this year\u2019s expected earnings per share (EPS), notably below its historical average. I believe this multiple offers a wide margin of safety and potential for considerable upside, especially with Wall Street anticipating EPS growth to accelerate over the medium term.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.\n\nSource: viper-zero / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother beaten-down blue chip stock worth buying near its 52-week lows is Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC). The company is known for its advanced aerospace and defense technologies and weapons systems, including the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft, and the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet.\n\nThe company is rightfully considered one of the most solid blue-chip stocks in the space, having consistently increased its earnings and dividends for years. In fact, Northrop boasts an impressive track record of 20 consecutive years of dividend increases, with its dividend per share having grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.9% over the past decade.\n\nWith such a strong performance historically, the company has solidified its status as a top investment in the aerospace and defense industry. Therefore, any underperformance in share price typically presents a compelling buying opportunity. This appears to be the case since NOC stock has declined 8% year-to-date against the broader market rally.\n\nBut apart from the stock\u2019s recent decline, the bullish case for Northrop is strong anyway, particularly in today\u2019s geopolitical climate, where the company stands to benefit greatly. Raised global tensions, including ongoing conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and instability in the Middle East, have led to notable increases in defense budgets worldwide. Northrop stock trading near its 52-week lows further adds to its overall attractiveness.\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS) General Mills Cereal, GIS stock\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but not least, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) is another blue-chip that has seen its stock underperform lately, having declined by about 15% over the past year. The packaged foods company owns a portfolio of iconic brands and household staples. General Mills tends to generate stable and predictable cash flows with products such as Cheerios, Haagen-Dazs ice cream, Yoplait yogurt, and Pillsbury baked goods comprising consumer favorites.\n\nIn fact, General Mills is regarded by many investors to be a recession-proof name precisely because consumers tend to continue buying their favorite foods and snacks even during economic downturns, making the company less vulnerable to fluctuations in consumer spending. This resilience is underscored by General Mills\u2019 robust track record of earnings and dividend growth. For instance, although the company halted its dividend increases from 2018 to 2020, temporarily ending its streak of consecutive hikes, it has never cut its dividend since 1990.\n\nAfter its extended decline over the past year, General Mills is now trading near its 52-week lows and at what seems to be a really attractive valuation. A further valuation compression appears unlikely at a P/E ratio of just 14X, which is based on FY2024\u2019s consensus EPS estimate of $4.49. Moreover, future EPS growth is expected to continue in the mid-single digits. Combined with a solid 3.8% yield and the company\u2019s overall strengths, these factors collectively make for a compelling investment opportunity near its 52-week lows.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nNikolaos Sismanis is a professional research analyst with five years of experience in the field of equity research and financial modeling.

        "title": "2 Stocks to Buy When the Market Crashes (and 2 to Avoid)",
        "content": "The stock market is soaring and investors are giddy about potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But I\u2019m not popping the champagne just yet. History shows that interest rate cuts have often preceeded recessions.\n\nSure, the labor market looks strong, and trends like re-industrialization bode well for the economy. However, if GDP underperforms as it did in Q1, there\u2019s always the possibility we could tip into a recession. European investors are already skeptical that this rally will last.\n\nI\u2019m not saying a crash is imminent, but it pays to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best. Some stocks hold up well in a recession, while others are more likely to get hammered. I\u2019ll highlight two stocks I believe are well-positioned to weather a downturn and two that could be in for a rough ride if the economy sours. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy When the Market Crashes: ThredUp (TDUP) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for ThredUp (TDUP).\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThredUp (NASDAQ:TDUP) is an online resale platform for apparel, shoes, and accessories. Indeed, this is a company that has been weathering a challenging economic environment. The stock has been trading sideways for a long time, but I believe a recovery could be on the horizon if consumers increasingly turn to secondhand goods in the face of financial pressures. ThredUp reported first-quarter revenue of $79.6 million, up 5% year-over-year, and gross margins expanded to 69.5%. The company is rapidly narrowing its losses, with adjusted EBITDA loss shrinking to just $0.7 million.\n\nResale is a major consumer trend, expected to more than double its market share and reach $350 billion globally by 2028. ThredUp\u2019s peer RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) has led to a significant recovery in TDUP stock. If ThredUp can surprise to the upside on top-line growth, the stock should follow suit. With active buyers reaching 1.7 million and orders growing 9%, ThredUp looks well positioned to capitalize on the secular shift toward secondhand goods. The company\u2019s investments in AI and expanding its Resale-as-a-Service program with major retailers could further fuel growth in the quarters ahead.\n\nMcDonalds (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises restaurants worldwide under the McDonald\u2019s brand. The fast-food giant recently launched a new $5 meal deal amidst a growing price war in the industry. I believe this affordable combo will prove very popular with budget-conscious consumers.\n\nThat said, McDonald\u2019s stock has taken a beating lately. It is down over 13% year-to-date as of July. This pullback seems overdone to me, as McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t historically performed this poorly outside of major recessions. I think the company\u2019s current valuation provides downside protection going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nImportantly, McDonald\u2019s has proven it can thrive during economic downturns. The company delivered impressive sales growth and restaurant expansion during the 2008 recession as cash-strapped consumers traded down to cheaper dining options. With its unmatched scale, modernized restaurants, and everyday value focus, I expect McDonald\u2019s to once again outperform if a recession unfolds.\n\nStocks to Avoid When the Market Crashes: Coinbase (COIN) A Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.\n\nSource: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. Notably, COIN stock has skyrocketed 181% over the past year as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit new highs, spurring a market recovery. That said, I believe now is not the time to join the Coinbase bandwagon. The crypto market is notoriously cyclical, and Coinbase may be peaking. Most altcoins have already been crushed, with Bitcoin being the only crypto somewhat holding up. Even without a recession, I think Coinbase could take a beating in the coming months.\n\nCoinbase reported blowout Q1 revenue of $1.64 billion, beating expectations of $1.34 billion. Net income was $1.18 billion, or $4.40 per share, compared to a year-ago loss. However, trading volumes on Coinbase\u2019s platform have decreased significantly since early March.\n\nMoreover, Coinbase insiders sold a collective $383 million worth of shares in Q1. That\u2019s more than double the amount sold in Q4 2023. Co-founder Fred Ehrsam alone netted $129 million from his share sales alone. Coinbase insider sells. Stocks to buy\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nCoinbase also faces ongoing legal challenges from the SEC. A judge ruled in March that the SEC\u2019s claim that Coinbase engaged in unregistered securities sales will proceed to trial. New competition from Crypto.com is regaining market share as well.\n\nWith all that in mind, I\u2019d steer clear of this crypto stock for now.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company. The company offers mobile app and website that offers people the ability to invest in stocks\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) operates an online brokerage platform that aims to democratize investing for the masses. I believe the company\u2019s recent explosive growth is largely relying on the frenzied stock market rally that has surpassed even the euphoria of 2021 in some respects, along with the ballooning crypto market. While Robinhood reported record revenues of $618 million in Q1 2024, up 40% year-over-year, and turned a profit with net income of $157 million, I\u2019m skeptical about the sustainability of this performance moving forward.\n\nThe company still faces significant headwinds and flaws in its business model. Robinhood\u2019s tendency to gamify trading encourages novice investors to trade riskily frequently.\u00a0The company also relies heavily on payment for order flow for revenue, a controversial practice that may result in customers getting worse execution prices.\n\nMoreover, Robinhood is currently under investigation by the SEC, having received a Wells notice regarding its crypto business.\u00a0Regulatory risks remain high. Additionally, I think Robinhood is far too exposed to the whims of the stock and crypto markets. Thus, if a recession drags down the market, Robinhood could be one of the worst hit companies out there.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tuesday, July 16, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), McDonald's Corporation (MCD) and American Express Company (AXP), as well as a micro-cap stock Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the year-to-date period (+21.8% vs. +19.9%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility. \r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. \r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance. \r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\r\n\r\nMcDonald's shares have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-14.8% vs. -12.4%). The company is witnessing macroeconomic challenges and commodity and wage inflation are primary headwinds. Earnings estimates for 2024 have declined in the past 60 days, depicting analysts concern regarding the stock growth potential. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, McDonald\u2019s is likely to benefit from marketing campaigns, unit expansion and a loyalty program. McDonald\u2019s is increasing its focus on menu innovation, as it believes that the strengthening of the core menu and solid marketing are likely to pave the way for additional growth in the upcoming periods. \r\n\r\nAlso, emphasis on Accelerating the Arches strategy bodes well. McDonald\u2019s expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth over the long term.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on McDonald\u2019s here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+39.3% vs. +13.0%). The company\u2019s growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. \r\n\r\nConsumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends. \r\n\r\nHowever, with higher utilization of the firm\u2019s cards, costs in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to go up. Rising marketing costs are straining its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. The stock is overvalued at the moment. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)\r\n\r\nSteel Partners' shares have underperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (-3.8% vs. +9.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $734.16 million have seen EBITDA margin declined from 14.2% to 12.3% in the first quarter of 2024 due to an underperformance in the Energy and Diversified Industrial segments. Energy revenues fell 33.7% and Diversified Industrial sales decreased 3.9%, impacting profitability. Also, fluctuations due to geopolitical tensions impact operational costs and investor confidence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Steel Partners' revenues rose 7% year over year to $476.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, driven by a consolidation in its supply chain and an 18.5% rise in Financial Services revenues. \r\n\r\nWith a diversified portfolio across various sectors and the inclusion of Steel Connect, SPLP mitigates risks and boosts growth. As of Mar 31, 2024, SPLP had $273.9 million in cash, with debt reduced to $92.8 million. SPLP also reduced interest expenses by 76.7% in the first quarter.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Analog Devices, Inc.

        "title": "3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows in July",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average encompasses 30 of America\u2019s well-established industrial giants.\n\nMost of them have made decent bets over the past five or more years. For the most part, Dow Jones stocks have followed the rally that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have experienced. That doesn\u2019t mean there have not been any hiccups on the way. Markets continue to be quite volatile throughout 2024. In fact, after a solid first quarter rally, a sharp market sell-off impacted all the major indices in early April due to a higher-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) report. Bubbling doubts about the extent to which the U.S. equities rally could last was also a key factor in the selling pressure we saw in the beginning of the second quarter.\n\nInto the third quarter, those doubts are still present in investors\u2019 minds. Nonetheless, this could make a good opportunity to buy quality stocks. Let\u2019s examine three Dow Jones stocks that are trading at 52-week lows.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike most (if not all) of the stocks on this list, Nike (NYSE:NKE) should not need an extensive introduction. The company designs and develops athletic footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories on a worldwide scale. Also, Nike provides athletic and casual footwear and apparel under a number of trademarks, including the Jumpman, Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell.\n\nInflation and elevated interest rates have made it difficult for Nike to grow revenue over the past year. In their fiscal year 2024 report, which ended on March 31st, sales grew a tepid 1% year-over-year (YOY). Sales for the fourth quarter, in particular, came in well below Wall Street\u2019s estimates. In fact, quarterly sales declined 2% YOY to $12.6 billion. The guidance for the ongoing quarter was also not so bright. Nike expects revenue to decline 10% YOY as it pivots to new products. Some good news that could incite more sales growth could be the Summer Olympics in Paris, starting in August.\n\nNKE shares are down nearly 31% over the past 12 months.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.\n\nSource: Gargantiopa / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food chain McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is trading at a 52-week low. Inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty are definitely to blame here. Consumers have become selective about the way in which they spend their dollars. And while McDonald\u2019s has surely benefitted from price growth over the last year, low-income customers have significantly pulled back their spending from the restaurant chain. Moreover, Middle Eastern boycotts of McDonald\u2019s (a result of its position on the Israel-Gaza war) have also hurt sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother factor contributing to downward pressure on McDonald\u2019s share price has been the rise of weight-loss drugs. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has been in the media over its weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. There fear is, as these weight-loss drugs become readily available, fast food chains like McDonald\u2019s will likely see a decrease in customer volume.\n\nHowever, it will probably be a while until that reality materializes. MCD shares are down 11.8% over the past 12 months. And with the fast food chain trading at 20.6x forward earnings, the company deserves another look from long-term investors.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has been core to networking and digital infrastructure for enterprises and public institutions for decades now. Through CSCO\u2019s \u201cAgile Networks\u201d division, it sells switches and routers, which are some of the basic components that help private and public networks to run. Outside of these networking products, Cisco Systems builds several kinds of routers that are important for the modern-day servers that power cloud networks.\n\nHowever, the problem for Cisco Systems has been much of its telecommunications provider customer base has been slow to upgrade their current equipment. Many telecom companies went on a buying spree a couple of years ago as supply chain constraints still were present globally. Now, those companies are sitting on a lot of equipment inventory that they need to digest. This isn\u2019t good news for Cisco Systems, which hopes to sell newer cloud products to its customers. CSCO shares have fallen 6% over the last 12 months. The company also trades at 13.7x forward earnings.\n\nThe supply constraints in the telecom market will take time to subside but will eventually do so. This should entice investors to buy Cisco Systems now, especially as it trades at a low multiple.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Safe Restaurant Stocks That Could Deliver Triple-Digit Returns by 2030",
        "content": "The stock market is like the Wild West, especially when investing in individual stocks. Safe restaurant stocks, however, provide investors with peace of mind in the face of economic uncertainties.\n\nThese established giants are certainly not your average tech company. They operate in a completely different environment and can often be tied to the economy\u2019s overall health. However, their resilient business models, consistent cash flows and loyal customer bases can deliver impressive returns over the long term.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2030, several restaurant stocks stand out as safe investments with the potential for triple-digit returns. The companies combine strong fundamentals, strategic growth initiatives and a proven record of returning value to shareholders. Furthermore, the global expansion of successful restaurant brands into emerging markets presents additional growth opportunities that investors can\u2019t miss.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the three best safe restaurant stocks that could deliver triple-digit returns by 2030!\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) has carved out a niche in the casual dining segment, focusing on high-quality steaks, refreshing sides and a unique family-oriented atmosphere. The company\u2019s attention to detail and superior dining experiences has contributed immensely to its impressive financial performance since the pandemic.\n\nTexas Roadhouse has emerged as a winner after emerging stronger than ever from the COVID-19 pandemic. Its stock has significantly outperformed the broader market in the last five years, rising an astonishing 215% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 86%. This certainly is not an accident, as the company\u2019s growth has been driven by its strategic initiatives and disciplined approach to expansion. The company has steadily increased its restaurant count while maintaining strict quality control standards.\n\nMoreover, the company opened 10 new restaurants in 2024, with another 18 currently under construction. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 12% yearly to $1.32 billion. Earnings per share rose 32% from the year prior, with comparable restaurant sales up 8.4%. As strong traffic trends continue, TXRH stock is among the best safe restaurant stocks to buy.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a behemoth in the fast-food industry. It is known for its vast presence and extensive menu, which caters to a wide range of tastes. The company\u2019s global reach, powerful brand, and restaurant expansion plans make it well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of McDonald\u2019s key strengths is its ability to innovate continuously. It has heavily invested in technology and digital innovation to enhance its customer experiences. This includes its growing loyalty rewards program, digital kiosks, mobile ordering and delivery options. These initiatives streamline its operations and cater to the growing trend of digital and contactless transactions. It has continued to show resilience in the first quarter of 2024, marking its 13th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth.\n\nFurthermore, the company is on pace to reach 50,000 restaurants by 2027. This positive backdrop and its poor stock performance in 2024 do not reflect its long-term growth prospects. With a solid financial foundation, MCD stock is one of the top restaurant stocks to buy for triple-digit returns through 2030.\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR) a tray of food from popeyes\n\nSource: Tony Prato / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) is the parent company of some of the most recognizable names in the fast-food industry, including Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes. Its growing revenue, earnings and strong pricing power make it a staple among safe restaurant stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nRestaurant Brands International\u2019s strategy focuses on expanding its footprint globally with its high-quality brands. It sees significant growth opportunities in emerging markets to drive comparable restaurant sales and strengthen its market positioning in fast-food offerings. Burger King, for instance, has been expanding its presence in Asia and Latin America.\n\nAdditionally, Tim Hortons, which has a significant presence in Canada, continues to expand into international markets. After reporting record revenue, earnings and double-digit system-wide sales growth in FY23, its growth is accelerating. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 9% year over year to $1.74 billion. Earnings per share rose 18% to 72 cents per share, with comparable sales up 4.6% from the year prior. Its strong financial performance and disciplined approach to capital allocation make it a compelling investment opportunity in 2024 and beyond.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the latest market close, McDonald's (MCD) reached $251.53, with a -0.93% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.28%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.53%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.4%.\n\nThe world's biggest hamburger chain's shares have seen an increase of 0.13% over the last month, not keeping up with the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.3% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of McDonald's in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on July 29, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $3.10, reflecting a 2.21% decrease from the same quarter last year.

These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the cost of all food jumped by 25% between 2019 and 2023. That's a bigger increase than other major categories like housing and health care. The USDA says supply chain issues were a major factor in 2020-2021, while bird flu and the war in Ukraine added to price hikes in 2022.\n\nMaking matters worse, O'Leary says inflation is forcing people to cut back on extras, including dining out.\n\n\"In this economy, an \u2018upscale McDonald's' is a luxury that many can't afford,\" O'Leary wrote.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom, though.

        "title": "The Smartest Dividend Stocks to Buy With $600 Right Now",
        "content": "Consumers are the heartbeat of the U.S. economy; their spending accounts for over 68% of America's economic output. Following all that money can lead you to some remarkable long-term investment ideas, and they're often brands you know and love.\n\nThese companies have years of growth and dividends on their resume, but have slipped due to fears that consumer spending is fading. High inflation is taking a toll on consumers, who are tightening their budgets and scrutinizing the dollars they spend.\n\nSince consumers should eventually bounce back, it could be wise to scoop up these proven winners while they are on sale.\n\nHere are four of them.\n\nA total investment of $600 will buy you a share of each. Buy, hold, and enjoy long-term growth, world-class brand power, and steadily growing dividends.\n\n1. Starbucks\n\nThe coffee giant has amassed over 38,000 stores worldwide on its way to market-beating investment returns. However, Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) is facing some questions about its growth prospects. Consumers have seemingly rebelled against soaring menu prices, and competition has stepped up to challenge Starbucks in China. Shares now trade at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 20, well off its 10-year average of 43.\n\nStarbucks continues to open stores, and analysts still believe the company's earnings will compound at over 12% annually for the next three to five years. While some people may be holding back from buying premium coffee, it seems like a stretch to say the brand has lost its luster. Starbucks now offers a starting dividend yield of 3%, and the company has raised its payout for 14 consecutive years. The sell-off seems way overdone at this point.\n\n2. Nike\n\nApparel giant Nike(NYSE: NKE) is another winner accused of losing its edge on the field. The stock plummeted after the company guided for a 10% drop in sales next quarter. The company is scrambling to reinvent itself in response to pressure from smaller competitors that have chipped away at its dominance in certain product categories. However, this doesn't change the fact that the Swoosh is still the industry giant by a wide margin. It still works with the world's most iconic athletes, from Michael Jordan to Caitlin Clark, and dominates professional sports.\n\nUltimately, there's a good chance Nike will get back on track. After all, you don't dominate your industry for decades without the ability to adapt when needed. Analysts still anticipate over 12% in annual earnings growth moving forward. The stock typically trades at over 37 times earnings, but that's fallen to a price-to-earnings ratio of just 19 today. The dividend has grown for 23 straight years, and its yield is now its highest in recent memory. It's a great contrarian opportunity for believers in the Swoosh.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Hershey\n\nConfectionary giant Hershey(NYSE: HSY) isn't a victim of self-inflicted troubles; it's just bad luck. A generationally bad cocoa harvest has spiked commodity prices to all-time highs, threatening Hershey's profits. The rapid growth of appetite-suppressing GLP-1 drugs has also hurt sentiment toward the stock. But Hershey's products aren't meals; they are treats. The company's various brands dominate store shelves in America, including Hershey's, Reese's, Twizzlers, and more.\n\nAnalysts have lowered earnings growth estimates to the low to mid single digits, and the stock has responded by selling down to a P/E of 18 versus its decade average of over 27. Hershey also offers a well-funded dividend that yields roughly 3% today and has grown for 15 consecutive years. The cocoa problem is real, but it could also pass and be a blip five years from now. Hershey's stock is rarely this cheap.\n\n4. McDonald's\n\nIconic restaurant chain McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) is grappling with more cost-conscious eaters. People are pushing back on McDonald's prices, which have crept high enough to have customers questioning the value the restaurant's brand is known for. Management discussed this challenge during the company's Q1 earnings and is responding with a $5 meal deal and other incentives to drive customers to use the company's smartphone app.\n\nPricing pressure has Wall Street unsure of McDonald's future growth prospects. The stock has slid below its 10-year average P/E ratio of 25 to just 20 times earnings. However, the company remains fundamentally sound. It makes most of its profits from the real estate its restaurants stand on, and the meal deal could alleviate price concerns. Meanwhile, McDonald's is a dividend rock star with 49 years of consecutive dividend growth and a solid 2.7% starting yield. Analysts are still estimating high-single-digit annual earnings growth, which could accelerate if consumers bounce back. For now, the stock is a proven winner on sale.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "US FTC issues warning to franchisors over unfair business practices",
        "content": "By Waylon Cunningham\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. trade regulator on Friday announced a suite of actions taking aim at \"unfair and deceptive practices\" it said are illegally imposed on U.S. franchisees by their brand owners, such as requiring new fees not outlined in franchise contracts, or using contract provisions to discourage franchisees from speaking with regulators.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission's declaration that these practices are illegal did not name any specific companies as being in violation of the law, but in doing so it took a stance on issues that have inflamed tensions in recent years between companies and operators at major brands like McDonald's and Subway.\n\n\"Franchising is a chance for Americans to build a business,\" said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a statement. \"But the FTC has heard concerns about how unfair franchisor practices, like a failure to fully disclose fees upfront, go unreported thanks to a fear of retaliation.\"\n\nThe International Franchise Association, a trade group that speaks on behalf of franchising companies, criticized the FTC's actions on Friday as \"contrary to the reality that the vast majority (of) franchise relationships are working and that franchising continues to grow each year.\"\n\nAmong the actions taken by the FTC was issuing a policy statement warning brand owners that it is illegal to discourage franchisees from speaking with regulators about unfair practices or potential law violations through non-disparagement contract clauses, or any threat of retaliation.\n\nRelatedly, the agency said it was soliciting a new round of comments from franchisees, brand owners and other stakeholders.\n\nThe agency also released new guidance that prohibits \"undisclosed junk fees\" -- echoing language used to describe hidden fees imposed on consumers -- that brand owners charge to franchisees, but which are not outlined in franchise contracts. As an example, the FTC said brand owners sometimes introduced these costs through on-the-fly changes to the operating manual, a sort of rulebook that franchisee owners must abide by to stay in compliance with their brand owners.\n\nIn response to a request for public comments on franchisor business practices last year, the agency received 5,200 comments, including some from McDonald's franchisees.\n\nThe National Owners Association, comprised of several hundred McDonald's franchisees, said in its comment that \"the current climate is dictatorial and there is zero room for negotiation\" with McDonald's. The burger chain unilaterally imposes new costs on franchise owners by making changes to the McDonald's operating manual, then uses non-disparagement clauses to silence critics, said the franchisee advocacy group, which formed in 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nAsked for comment, McDonald's referred Reuters to the International Franchise Association's statement.\n\nThe FTC said the number of franchise-related complaints submitted to the agency had increased significantly over the past three years, citing an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office published last year.\n\n\"Today the Commission is making clear that contractual terms prohibiting franchisees from reporting potential law violations to the government are unfair, unenforceable, and illegal,\" the FTC statement said.\n\n(Reporting by Waylon Cunningham and Ismail Shakil; editing by Rami Ayyub and Rosalba O'Brien)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for McDonald's is US$300 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$250 suggests McDonald's is potentially trading close to its fair value Our fair value estimate is 2.3% lower than McDonald's' analyst price target of US$307\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$9.01b US$10.4b US$11.4b US$12.4b US$13.3b US$14.0b US$14.6b US$15.1b US$15.6b US$16.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x4 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 6.57% Est @ 5.31% Est @ 4.43% Est @ 3.82% Est @ 3.38% Est @ 3.08% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1%  US$8.3k US$8.9k US$9.0k US$9.1k US$9.0k US$8.7k US$8.4k US$8.1k US$7.7k US$7.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$85b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$16b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (8.1%\u2013 2.4%) = US$287b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$287b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$131b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$216b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$250, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.250. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for McDonald's\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "content": "The stock market has been stellar so far in 2024. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit fresh all-time highs, but volatility could creep back in as rate cuts take effect. This may seem counter-intuitive. But historically speaking, recessions and downturns have aligned with the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts.\n\nYet, despite the near-term uncertainty, I remain optimistic about the market\u2019s prospects over the mid-to-long term. Why? History has shown repeatedly that a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality companies can weather any storm and deliver solid returns.\n\nIn fact, some of the best-performing stocks of the past decade were those that investors simply bought and held. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s worth looking into a diversified basket of stocks that could keep performing well going forward. Let\u2019s explore seven such stocks to buy that may fit the bill.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) continues to be a darling of Wall Street. Analysts are issuing strong buy ratings on the company\u2019s more affordable Class B shares. They see the stock as undervalued at current levels, with an average price target 15% above the current trading price. I tend to agree that owning Berkshire Hathaway is like having a diversified portfolio all on its own.\n\nThe company holds a wide array of businesses, from insurers to the BNSF railway. This allows Buffett to nimbly shift capital from lagging industries to those with more promise. With the company\u2019s cash hoard expected to top $200 billion by quarter-end, the Oracle of Omaha has immense flexibility to capitalize on opportunities.\n\nAlso, Berkshire Hathaway benefits from some key economic tailwinds. Its energy and utility operations provide steady cash flows, while its insurers are well-positioned in an environment of rising interest rates. And with the U.S. economy still expanding, the firm\u2019s industrial and consumer businesses have a favorable backdrop.\n\nWhile Buffett\u2019s advancing age may concern some investors, the iconic investor shows no signs of slowing down. He\u2019s built a company that can endure for the long haul and has a succession plan in place. For those seeking a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type of investment, Berkshire Hathaway remains a compelling choice.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis e-commerce and cloud computing giant is riding several powerful megatrends that I believe position it extremely well for continued growth in the years ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst off, Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) investment in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic is already paying major dividends. Anthropic\u2019s latest model, Claude 3.5, is outperforming OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o on most benchmarks.\n\nSecondly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to dominate the cloud infrastructure market with a 17% revenue jump. As more companies shift workloads to the cloud, including AI applications, AWS provides a strong and stable growth engine for Amazon.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock does trade at a steep premium, but I believe this is justified given the company\u2019s tremendous growth prospects that extend far beyond e-commerce. Multiple analysts have raised price targets, with Jefferies seeing an 18%-plus upside.\n\nYes, Amazon is an expensive stock. But I think it\u2019s worth paying up for a company with such a wide moat. Other \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks have soared past their 2021 peaks, but AMZN trades around $199 compared to the $186 peak in 2021.

The latest data from Statista shows Google still commands over 82% of the global search market share. Bing barely made a dent. It makes sense that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has done so well, as Wall Street realizes the bear thesis has been wrong.\n\nGoogle now has its own powerful AI called Gemini that it\u2019s integrating into Search. This should help expand the types of queries Google can handle and improve user satisfaction. Plus, YouTube has been making aggressive moves to boost ad revenue. It is the world\u2019s second most visited site. And cracking down on ad blockers was a smart decision that will likely pay big dividends. Analysts seem to agree, with the majority rating Alphabet\u2019s stock a strong buy.\n\nConsider these tailwinds, along with Google Cloud\u2019s strong 28% growth and the company\u2019s leadership in mobile with Android. Thus, the future looks very bright for Alphabet. The stock has already surged 36% year-to-date (YTD), but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it go much higher as these AI investments and YouTube changes bear fruit.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) continues to ride the megatrend of the global shift from cash to digital payments, which has years of runway ahead. The company delivered another strong quarter, with revenue up 10% and EPS growing 20%. Key business drivers like payments volume, cross-border transactions and processed transactions all showed relative stability and growth.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic about Visa\u2019s future prospects. The pandemic accelerated the war on cash, and much of that behavior change has persisted even as economies reopened. Visa is well-positioned to capture the $20+ trillion opportunity to convert cash, checks and domestic network transactions to its network, especially in emerging markets. Contactless payments, e-commerce and value-added services provide additional levers for growth.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on the stock, with 19 buy ratings and a $317 average price target, implying 19% upside. Visa benefits from powerful network effects. The more merchants that accept Visa, the more consumers want a Visa card, creating a virtuous cycle. This has enabled remarkably consistent and profitable growth for a company of Visa\u2019s immense scale.\n\nAdditionally, Visa\u2019s business model can thrive in any economic environment. In a strong economy, payment volumes rise. When interest rates are high, Visa earns more on credit balances. However, in a weaker economy with low rates, consumers tend to borrow and transact more on credit, so Visa still wins. It\u2019s a great way to gain exposure to the financial sector while sidestepping many of the risks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock has had a rough start to 2024, down over 17% YTD amid broader market volatility. However, the recent weakness presents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is benefiting from its affordable fast food, drive-thru convenience and digital ordering. The company\u2019s scale advantages and strong brand allow it to weather economic downturns better than its peers.\n\nIn fact, McDonald\u2019s tends to outperform during recessions as cash-strapped consumers trade down to lower-priced options. The company grew earnings by double-digits annually during the Great Recession. More recently, McDonald\u2019s held up relatively well during the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to its drive-thru lanes and delivery partnerships. Its franchised restaurant count actually grew in 2020. MCD franchised restaurants chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for exposure to the restaurant industry, McDonald\u2019s is the cream of the crop. Analysts seem to agree, with firms like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently reiterating their bullish ratings on the stock. While near-term headwinds remain, McDonald\u2019s entrenched popularity and recession-resistant business model make it a compelling long haul. Don\u2019t be surprised to see the Golden Arches shine bright once again.\n\nAntero Midstream (AM) a gas pipe with the sun going down in the background, natural\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAntero Midstream (NYSE:AM) is riding high on the tailwinds of a shifting global energy landscape. The company recently reported strong first-quarter 2024 results, with double-digit growth in EBITDA and free cash flow. Also, AM placed a new compressor station into service to support future throughput growth in the liquids-rich Marcellus Shale.\n\nFurther, Antero Midstream is well-positioned to benefit from Europe\u2019s move away from Russian gas. The E.U. has dramatically reduced its reliance on Russia, with the U.S. emerging as its top liquified natural gas supplier. Even if the war were to end, I expect these sanctions to persist. Moreover, Europe will likely prioritize energy security even if sanctions are not in place. Additionally, natural gas prices have rebounded significantly.\n\nWith a 6.12% dividend yield, Antero Midstream should give you more than enough income. The stock has climbed nearly 28% over the past year, too.\n\nChubb (CB) Person holding cellphone with logo of Swiss insurance company Chubb Limited on screen in front of business webpage. CB stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nNotably, the insurance industry is one of the most consistent and stable sectors. And within this space, Chubb (NYSE:CB) is one of the best bets you can make. The company has been growing at an impressive clip. Over the past year alone, Chubb stock has climbed nearly 35%.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, Chubb reported strong earnings, with core operating income up over 20% to $2.2 billion and EPS surging nearly 23%. Also, Chubb is smartly leaning into growth areas like cyber insurance and climate risk mitigation, which could eventually become major businesses. The profitability is solid due to its combined ratio of 86.5%. Within insurance, a combined ratio below 100% translates to an underwriting profit. CB combined ratio\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Chubb\u2019s prospects. The stock has nearly a dozen buy ratings, and its average price target implies decent upside from current levels. Notably, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has built a multi-billion dollar stake in Chubb. All things considered, it is the best stock you can buy right now in the insurance industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing in discounted blue-chip stocks can be a noble strategy with the stock market at all time highs. As the Federal Reserve remains neutral on its interest rate decisions, well established companies can add a layer of stability to your portfolio.\n\nThese stocks provide investors with reliability and strong performance in wake of market volatility. They often have robust business models, strong liquidity, and a history of returning value to shareholders. This can be enticing for investors who are cautious of the market\u2019s rally going into the election. Additionally, these companies are intriguing when their stock prices dip below their intrinsic value.\n\nWhile past performance is no indication of future results, exposure to blue chip companies is a prudent strategy to mitigate risks as they emerge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are the top 3 discounted blue-chip stocks to buy in 2024!\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), one of the largest financial institutions in the world, stands out as a top pick among discounted blue-chip stocks to buy in 2024. The company has thrived amidst inflation and higher interest rates, and its liquidity is extremely strong.\n\nThe recent market conditions over the last 24 months have presented a rare opportunity to invest in JPMorgan at a discount. When inflation took off in the back half of 2021, the stock market was subsequently crushed. Inflation was not transitory after all, and the Federal Reserve was forced to take on a more restrictive monetary policy. While this was bad for the broader stock market, it was great news for JPMorgan\u2019s bottom line.\n\nJPMorgan benefited tremendously from higher interest rates, and the company saw record revenue and net interest income in FY23. Moreover, it strengthened its liquidity and capitalized on the regional banking crisis. The outlook for the 2024 fiscal year remains strong, with the company recently increasing its net interest income outlook to $91 billion FY24. JPM\u2019s valuation and forward price to earnings of 12.64 suggest there is more room for upside in 2024.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD) An image of a red McDonald's french fry container with the yellow \"M\" logo on it in front of a half red and half yellow background.\n\nSource: Nixx Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp (NYSE:MCD) is another top contender for investors looking to buy discounted blue-chip stocks in 2024. With a vast international presence and brand recognition worldwide, McDonald\u2019s has built a robust business model that very few can replicate.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp has suffered a great deal thus far in 2024. The stock is down 17% year to date, and has come under pressure due to a variety of factors. This includes persistent inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer behavior. However, these challenges are largely temporary and do not undermine the company\u2019s long term growth potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has a history of navigating through economic headwinds and emerging stronger, thanks to its ability to adapt and innovate. For instance, the company is embracing digital transformation and rapidly expanding its loyalty rewards program. Moreover, the company\u2019s restaurant expansion plans aim at hitting 50,000 restaurants by 2027. This is extremely bullish, and its first quarter earnings results were strong despite ongoing headwinds in the economy. With a trailing price to earnings of 21, MCD stock is among the best discounted blue-chip stocks to buy now.\n\nCanadian National Railway (CNI) A photo of a Canadian National (CNI) train coming down the tracks toward the photographer.\n\nSource: Eric Buermeyer / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI), a dominant player in the North American transportation industry, plays a crucial role in the continent\u2019s logistics and supply chain infrastructure. The stock is down 8% year to date, suggesting that there could be an opportunity for investors to unlock hidden value.\n\nCanadian National Railway has experienced a decline due to concerns over economic slowdowns and regulatory challenges. However, the company\u2019s fundamental strengths remain intact. Its wide moat and extensive network spanning Canada and the United States, provides critical infrastructure for various industries. This makes the company incredibly attractive as it transports key materials across agriculture, energy, and manufacturing to keep economies in flow.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the company navigated a challenging macroeconomic environment quite well. While top line growth was largely flat, it grew its earnings per share by 15%. Additionally, its profit margins and cash flow are extremely healthy. With double digit earnings per share growth forecasted through 2026, CNI should be kept on your radar in the second half of 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The S&amp;P 500 Just Hit an All-Time High, but These 2 Dow Dividend Stocks Are Buys Near Their 52-Week Lows",
        "content": "Not all major indices have performed equally well so far in 2024. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 22.3%, while the S&P 500 index has delivered a solid 16.7%. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is sorely lagging with less than a 5% year-to-date gain.\n\nWhile it's typical for the Dow to underperform more growth-focused indexes during bull markets, this level of underperformance is a bit surprising considering outsized gains from Amazon, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and other large Dow components. Dig deeper, however, and there have been some significant sell-offs in reliable blue-chip stalwarts like UnitedHealth Group and Home Depot.\n\nThis could also spell opportunity. My preferred approach is to filter out the noise and focus on a path to recovery rather than getting too caught up in everything that is going wrong at the time. The Dow is a good starting point because many components have strong long-term investment theses.\n\nYear-to-date,\u00a0McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) is the fourth-worst-performing Dow stock and Nike(NYSE: NKE) has been the worst. Despite some noteworthy obstacles, here\u2019s why both companies stand out as particularly strong buys now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNike is in a historic slowdown\n\nNike is hovering around its lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic-induced plunge in spring 2020. At first glance, the sell-off seems unwarranted, considering that Nike's sales are close to an all-time high and margins aren't that low. NKE Chart\n\nHowever, the stock market cares more about where a company is headed than where it has been. And unfortunately, Nike has reached a breaking point.\n\nCracks in Nike's business have been forming for a while now. After the company reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings in late September 2022, Nike stock tumbled all the way down to $82.22 per share on Oct. 3, 2022. The sell-off was due to falling profit, inflated inventory levels, and challenges with growth out of key markets, including China.\n\nNike's recent earnings call featured many of the same nagging themes. Revenue growth has ground to a halt -- with sales falling 2% in fiscal 2024. Expectations are even worse for fiscal 2025, with revenue expected to fall mid-single digits. The forecast is particularly bad considering Nike had guided for positive sales growth in fiscal 2025 during the March earnings call.\n\nIt's somewhat ironic that Nike's Board of Directors approved a massive $18 billion stock buyback program in June 2022 -- right before problems accelerated. In fiscal 2024, Nike bought back $4.3 billion in stock and paid $2.2 billion in dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowing the dividend and buying back stock can be an effective way to return capital to shareholders if the underlying business is on solid footing. But in Nike's case, the business is in its worst shape in years, so putting capital to work to help the business improve rather than plugging away at buybacks could be a better move.\n\nNike isn't showing many signs of turning things around anytime soon, so buying the stock now is really a bet on the brand and Nike's track record rather than where the fundamentals stand today. The glass-half-full outlook on Nike makes the stock a strong buy now. Nike has been hit hard by a one-two punch of tight consumer spending and formidable competition from smaller brands, such as Deckers Outdoor-owned Hoka and On Holding.\n\nHowever, Nike has overcome competition and economic challenges before, and there's reason to think it can right the ship again. Nike has expanded its e-commerce business and understands that selling directly to consumers opens the door to higher margins and better customer engagement. The more Nike can tap into an omnichannel business model, the higher its margins and revenue growth will likely be.\n\nThe dividend yield is up to 1.9% and the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is down to 23.6 -- which is Nike's highest yield in 15 years and an inexpensive valuation for an industry-leading business. In sum, Nike stock is tumbling for valid reasons and could have more room to fall. But the business could also look far different in three to five years, making now an excellent opportunity to consider buying the stock.\n\nMcDonald's is restoring value\n\nLike Nike, McDonald's has been impacted by a price-conscious consumer. McDonald's hiked prices to keep up with inflation, which initially worked. But there's concern that McDonald's has run out of room and needs to remind customers that they can get good value by going to its restaurants. McDonald's last earnings call was chock-full of concern that sales growth is under pressure and the company needs to restore its image.\n\nOn June 20, McDonald's issued a press release announcing its \"highly anticipated $5 Meal Deal\" which includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink. It also announced a free medium fry with any $1 purchase every Friday through its app through the end of 2024. Even if McDonald's barely turns a profit on these deals, they could be just what the company needs to boost traffic -- especially as families are out and about over the summer.\n\nMcDonald's is best in breed when it comes to returning capital to shareholders. The company has been raising its dividend and buying back stock at a breakneck pace. Over the last decade, McDonald's has more than doubled its dividend while reducing its share count by over a quarter. In October, the company boosted its dividend by 10%, marking the 47th consecutive dividend raise and putting McDonald's on track to become a Dividend King by 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, buybacks have helped accelerate earnings-per-share growth -- making the stock a better value. Over time, buybacks can help earnings per share (EPS) grow faster than net income. MCD EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nIn the chart, you can see that McDonald's stock has put up impressive gains over the last decade, with the stock price going up nearly twice as much as net income. But thanks to buybacks, EPS growth has mostly kept up with the stock price, which is why McDonald's P/E ratio is only slightly higher today than it was a decade ago. And in fact, it is currently lower than its historical averages. MCD PE Ratio Chart\n\nMcDonald's has faced a slowdown in consumer spending and economic cycles before. There's no reason to believe that its current setbacks impact the long-term investment thesis, making McDonald's and its 2.7% dividend yield an\u00a0 attractive opportunity for patient investors.\n\nNike and McDonald's have fallen far enough\n\nA stock's price can be heavily influenced by short-term factors rather than the company's underlying characteristics or where the business could be three to five years from now. The key is to filter out the noise and decide if these concerns haven't already been reflected in the stock price, or if the stock has been overly punished.\n\nNike is down over 30% year to date, while McDonald's is down just over 15%. But Nike is admittedly facing greater challenges than McDonald's.\n\nIt's impossible to know when either stock will stop selling off, but it is possible to get a good idea for why a stock is selling off. For Nike and McDonald's, it's all about returning to growth while maintaining margins. Given their strategies, I could see both companies focusing more on sales growth in the near term and worrying about margins later. It could take a while for Nike and McDonald's to return to the consistent growth that investors have grown accustomed to, but both stocks have solid dividends and compelling valuations.\n\nOne of the best ways to compound money in the stock market is to invest in great companies when they are out of favor and hold shares through periods of volatility. Nike and McDonald's have sold off far enough that they are both worth a closer look now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nike wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Sabrina 1 alone captured two points of market share in the U.S. basketball market. Signing prominent athletes and successful marketing campaigns, like the one celebrating Jayson Tatum\u2019s NBA Finals title, further bolstered the brand\u2019s position in the basketball market.\n\nDespite overall challenges (Road Running market) in the running segment, new releases such as Vomero, Invincible, Infinity and Structure showed double-digit growth in Q4. The launch of the Pegasus 41, supported by a\u00a0comprehensive marketing campaign, received strong consumer reviews and better-than-expected sell-through rates. Indeed, the strategic focus on simplifying the retail structure and highlighting key cushioning technologies may drive future growth in this competitive segment.\n\nTo conclude, Nike\u2019s strong segment sales growth and high bottom-line uplift support its high mark among the top undervalued stocks.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in JNJ.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Roundup: McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) And The Rest Of The Traditional Fast Food Segment\n\nLet's dig into the relative performance of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q1 traditional fast food earnings season.\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nThe 14 traditional fast food stocks we track reported a decent Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and traditional fast food stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 7.9% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD)\n\nArguably one of the most iconic brands in the world, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food behemoth known for its convenience, value, and wide assortment of menu items.\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.17 billion, up 4.6% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was an ok quarter for the company:\u00a0Its revenue, same-store sales growth, and EPS were in line with analysts' expectations, showing the business is holding steady.\n\n\"Our global comparable sales growth in the first quarter marks 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last 4 years,\" said CEO Chris Kempczinski.

It was a weak quarter for the company:\u00a0Its revenue and EPS unfortunately missed analysts' expectations as its same-store sales declined by 4% (driven by a 6% decline in volumes offset by a 2% increase in prices).\n\nAs expected, the stock is down 17.3% since the results and currently trades at $73.16.\n\nRead our full analysis of Starbucks's results here.\n\nDutch Bros (NYSE:BROS)\n\nStarted in 1992 by two brothers as a single pushcart, Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) is a dynamic coffee chain that\u2019s captured the hearts of coffee enthusiasts across the United States.\n\nDutch Bros reported revenues of $275.1 million, up 39.5% year on year, surpassing analysts' expectations by 7.6%.

        "content": "The metaverse is still very much alive and well, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nAt the moment, we\u2019re seeing metaverse growth in gaming and e-commerce. We\u2019re also seeing it in retail with IKEA and Nike (NYSE:NKE), for example. We\u2019re seeing it with McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) latest jump into the metaverse. Plus, we\u2019re seeing it in advertising, health and wellness, education and live entertainment.\n\nAccording to CoinTrust.com, the global metaverse market could grow 575% to nearly $500 billion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nAs noted by TynMagazine.com, \u201cAccording to Statista\u2019s forecast, the total number of users in the metaverse landscape is projected to hit almost 2.6 billion by the end of the decade, four times more than the earlier forecast and three times more than this year.\u00a0The total addressable market or the revenue opportunity for metaverse products and services in the conservative scenario, where 15% of the digital economy shifts to the metaverse, is expected to hit $1.9 trillion in this period.\u201d\n\nThat said, I\u2019d use every dip in metaverse stocks as a buying opportunity.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to top metaverse stocks, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) will always be a top pick.\n\nFor one, multiple companies are working with Roblox to jump into the metaverse. That includes Nike, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Gucci, McDonald\u2019s and Forever 21 \u2014 to name a few. Two,\u00a0Roblox is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse. It builds out a human co-experience platform that enables billions of users to come together to play, learn, communicate and explore.\n\nThree,\u00a0recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock.\u00a0Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie initiated coverage of RBLX with an Outperform rating, noting it\u2019s one of the main \u201cbuilding blox\u201d of the metaverse.\n\nMoffettNathanson also upgraded the stock with a $26 target after the sell-off in the stock.\u00a0Better, as RBLX continues to pivot higher with the metaverse story, it\u2019s a strong buy.\n\nLast trading at $39.82, the company just refilled its earnings gap in early May. From this price, I\u2019d like to see RBLX run back to $47 a share initially.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a strong buy opportunity. Currently trading at $128.20, I\u2019d like to see NVDA trade closer to $150 in the near term.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips and strong earnings growth, it\u2019s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real-time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its\u00a0new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nHelping, analysts at UBS (NYSE:UBS) say NVDA could earn $5 a share in 2025 as budgets for hyper-scalers begin to firm up. The firm also has a $150 price target.\n\nWolfe Research also raised its price target to $150, \u201cnoting that recent checks indicate a path to 50% or more content growth for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in 2025, with incremental upside coming from unit growth and better networking attach rates,\u201d as reported by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Metaverse stock. gaming cryptos\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you\u2019d rather diversify with an exchange-traded fund (ETF), there\u2019s also the\u00a0Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 40 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse\u2019s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030.\u00a0Some of its top holdings include\u00a0Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Roblox, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nFueling upside, \u201cThe Metaverse\u2019s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion,\u201d said RoundHill Investments.\n\nTwo, \u201cVR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.\u201d\n\nBoth could help fuel a significant upside for METV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with McDonald's (MCD) standing at $247.85, reflecting a -1.29% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.1%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.08%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.28%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had lost 2% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 3.31% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.08% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of McDonald's in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on July 29, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $3.10, signifying a 2.21% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.68 billion, up 2.85% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.19 per share and revenue of $26.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +2.09% and +4.41%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for McDonald's. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.15% increase.

        "content": "Few industries were as hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic as the restaurant sector. According to the National Restaurant Association, the pandemic resulted in $240 billion of financial losses at U.S. restaurants. Additionally, it wiped out 2.5 million jobs and led more than 110,000 dining establishments to permanently close. In all, the pandemic obliterated six years of growth across the restaurant industry.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many restaurants, including the biggest chains, are still recovering from the devastation. Another complicating factor has been the sharp rise in inflation coming out of the pandemic, which forced many restaurants to raise prices and further alienate customers. The end result has been soft financial results and depressed share prices. However, glimmers of hope are starting to emerge for the sector.\n\nSo now could be a good time to pick-up stocks while they\u2019re on sale, such as these three most undervalued restaurant stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock looks enticing at current levels. Shares of the Golden Arches are down 15% this year and close to a 52-week low. Also, the stock trades at 21 times future earnings estimates, which is below the historic average for the company. Throw in a quarterly dividend payment of $1.67 a share, for a yield of 2.66%, and MCD stock looks like good value right now if not undervalued.\n\nSpeaking of value, McDonald\u2019s is in the midst of bringing back its popular $5 value meal. It relaunched on June 25 and runs for one month before it is discontinued again. The short-term promotion includes a choice of a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small french fries, four-piece Chicken McNuggets and a small soft drink for only five bucks. The meal is expected to give the company\u2019s earnings a lift. Some analysts are encouraging McDonald\u2019s to make this value meal permanent.\n\nAnalysts see more upside ahead for MCD stock, with the median price target on the shares 23% higher than current levels. This makes McDonald\u2019s an undervalued restaurant stock worth considering.\n\nCracker Barrel (CBRL) Cracker Barrel Old Country Store sign on the outside of one of its locations\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors hunting for a really beaten down restaurant stock to bottom fish should consider Cracker Barrel (NASDAQ:CBRL). The company\u2019s share price is down 50% on the year and sitting right at a 52-week low after announcing in May that it is cutting its quarterly dividend payment by 80%. CBRL stock is currently trading at 14 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dividend cut lowered Cracker Barrel\u2019s distribution to 25 cents from $1.30, and the move has gone over like a lead balloon with investors. Previously, Cracker Barrel had one of the highest yielding dividends at 9.08%. However, after the cut, the dividend still has a decent yield of 2.54%, which is higher than most publicly traded companies. Another reason to be optimistic is that Cracker Barrel is overhauling its brand and stores as part of a multi-year $180 million revitalization effort.\n\nNotably, analysts\u2019 median price target is 40% higher than the shares current trading level.\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR)\n\nAnother down on its luck stock to consider is Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR). The parent company of Burger King, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs has seen its share price decline 10% this year. Over five years, QSR stock has registered no gain (down 0.93%). The shares are currently trading at 17 times future earnings estimates and offer investors a quarterly dividend of 58 cents a share, for a yield of 3.33%.\n\nAs with the other companies mentioned, management at Restaurant Brands is working to turn around the fortunes of its chains and stock. In particular, the company is undertaking a major refresh of Burger King, remodeling restaurants and spending more money on advertising to drive customer traffic. Restaurant Brands shelled out $1 billion to buy Burger King\u2019s largest U.S. franchisee, Carrols Restaurant Group, in a deal aimed at helping the chain renovate its locations faster.\n\nThe median price target on QSR stock among 18 analysts is 23% higher than the current share price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Triple Threat Stocks to Buy: High Yields, Big Gains and Rock-Solid Safety",
        "content": "Life and the market are about compromise. Generally speaking, if you\u2019re looking for high growth, you typically aren\u2019t getting much in the way of dividends, if anything. On the other hand, established enterprises usually offer robust passive income at the expense of growth potential. Still, on rare occasions, it\u2019s possible to have high-yield safe stocks that can also expand the top line.\n\nFundamentally, the math helps the underlying narrative. Presently, we have thousands upon thousands of publicly traded opportunities available. It\u2019s simply not possible for analysts to provide equal coverage to every enterprise. So, it\u2019s inevitable that some companies \u2013 even big ones \u2013 fall through the cracks. Intrepid investors can exploit this \u201ccoverage gap\u201d so to speak and potentially profit handsomely.\n\nFurther, in shaky circumstances \u2013 such as a recovery from a pandemic \u2013 the established players can deliver some surprises. Basically, their massive footprint enables surprisingly stout performances. With that in mind, below are enticing high-yield safe stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest beverage (and snack) manufacturers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is no stranger to the business community. Thanks to its massive footprint, it easily commands stability. Further, amid a tough economic environment, PepsiCo offers a cheap source of caffeine. Given this and many other advantages, it\u2019s no surprise that analysts rate PEP stock a consensus moderate buy.\n\nAnother factor to consider regarding Pepsi is its financial consistency. During the past four quarters, its average earnings per share landed at $1.90. However, covering experts anticipated EPS of almost $1.81. Therefore, the earnings surprise came out to nearly 5.1%. That\u2019s not bad for an established stalwart.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Pepsi posted net income of $9.18 billion or earnings of $6.63 per share. Revenue during the cycle came out to $91.88 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate 11.2% growth in the top line to $94.44 billion.\n\nLastly, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 3.33%. It makes a solid case for high-yield safe stocks to buy.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface, integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) might not seem the most relevant idea for high-yield safe stocks. With the ideological winds pushing for green and sustainable solutions, Exxon seems anachronistic. Still, the world runs on oil. And one geopolitical flashpoint could change the narrative cynically in favor of XOM stock. Thus, it carries a moderate buy view among experts with a $135.53 average price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdmittedly, Exxon has encountered a rough patch in terms of meeting expectations. In the past four quarters, its average EPS reached just under $2.19. However, analysts were looking on average for around $2.20. Therefore, the earnings surprise landed at about half a percent below parity. That\u2019s not ideal.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Exxon posted net income of $32.8 billion or $8.16 per share. Revenue in the cycle hit $335.35 billion, which is rather disappointing. For fiscal 2024, analysts only see a modest lift in the top line to $353.7 billion. However, it\u2019s also possible that sales could soar to $470.13 billion based on geopolitical rumblings.\n\nOh yeah, the oil giant offers a big yield of 3.31%.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. Basically, the Golden Arches is both a business icon and a symbol of American capitalism. So, when it comes to attributes like brand power and awareness, MCD hits the safe component of high-yield safe stocks. However, does it provide much growth and is it a dividend monster?\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to expect a blue-chip icon to have the growth potential of a promising tech startup. However, McDonald\u2019s is a respectable growth machine given how long it\u2019s been in business. During the TTM period, it posted net income of $8.6 billion on sales of $25.76 billion. In the most recent quarter, its sales growth rate (year-over-year) came in at 4.6%.\n\nSure, that\u2019s not the most impressive stat you\u2019ve seen. However, keep in mind that for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate revenue of $26.6 billion. That\u2019s up 11.7% from the prior year. As for the bottom line, McDonald\u2019s has seen average EPS of $2.96 in the past four quarters. That helps to support the underlying dividend yield of 2.67%. Overall, it\u2019s one of the balanced high-yield safe stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against the other restaurant stocks.\n\nCurrently, quite a bit of anxiety is struck by restaurant stocks in the market, as the Russell index that tracks restaurants experienced a 6% fall since March 2024. Other sectors, like industrials, and materials, to name a few, are experiencing a similar struggle as restaurants. This situation, as a whole, is indicative of potential late-cycle market issues marked by the market\u2019s slow growth in general, which is driven by consumer distress in the U.S. in a larger sense.\n\nMoreover, amidst this inflation-stricken market, restaurants in the U.S. are in quite a bit of a meal deal war, hoping to fulfill the customers\u2019 need for affordability. As such, Sonic, a drive-in fast-food chain headquartered in Oklahoma, U.S., is the newest member to join the war, as it has introduced a $1.99 value menu, boasting a selection of various food items.\n\nPreviously, Taco Bell and Burger King have already introduced their discounted meal deals, showcasing various brands\u2019 dire attempts to attract customers in the given circumstances. Moreover, this is also driven by increased food and wage costs in the market, pushing down the margins of various restaurant brands, according to analysts. The Consumer Price Index has risen at a cumulative rate of 20.8% since February 2020, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Thus, this explains why restaurant ETFs and stocks have started off the third quarter on a lower note.\n\nNevertheless, there\u2019s bright hope as the global fast food, which goes hand-in-hand with the restaurant industry, is set to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% from 2023 to 2032, expected to reach $1 trillion by then. Furthermore, one can keep their hopes high, as it is reported that a staggering 37% of the U.S. population is a consumer of fast food. For the fast-food market, the millennial segment is one that it must rely on the most, as 54% of this segment steps toward fast-food chains once or twice every week. You can check out our article about the 20 Fast Food Chains with Most Locations in the World.\n\nOn the other hand, according to the National Restaurant Association, the U.S. restaurant industry is forecasted to result in $1.1 trillion worth of sales in the year 2024. This will translate into the employment of 15.7 million Americans. However, amidst the supply chain inefficiencies and rising costs, it would be challenging for restaurant operators to make profits, and technology is expected to play a decisive role in determining the winners and losers of the market in the coming time, according to market analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, it\u2019s essential to know where to put your money, when it comes to the restaurant market. Hence, now we will take you to our list of 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today, we gathered a list of all companies with a significant presence in the restaurant industry. We then further narrowed down the list based on the companies\u2019 respective upside potential and ranked the finest remaining companies by their number of hedge fund holders as of Q1, 2024, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database that tracks the activity of 920 hedge funds. For stocks with an equal number of hedge fund holders, we used their upside as the tiebreaker. Plus, note that all the stock prices quoted are as of writing this article unless otherwise stated.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 15 Highest Quality Coffee Chains in the US\n\nA barista pouring freshly brewed coffee from an espresso machine to a cup in a bustling cafe.\n\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Already being the biggest coffee chain in the world, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has no plans to stop! It has set out a goal to take its total tally of locations to 55,000 by the year 2030 from 38,000, as of 2024. On the other hand, it aims to increase its number of U.S. outlets from 16,352 currently to 20,000! A growth of 4% is expected for its net openings in the U.S. in 2024. It\u2019s the fastest-growing fast-food chain in the U.S., as reported by one of the articles by Insider Monkey. Thus, it's safe to say that the analysts are putting their faith in the company\u2019s goals, as 10 more hedge funds have taken up a stake in the company\u2019s stock, taking the total tally to 69! These stakes translate into a value of a whopping $2.7 billion! Furthermore, Starbucks Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock is carrying a satisfying upside potential of 16%. However, the Q2 2024 performance of the company was quite disappointing, summed up by Laxman Narasimhan, the company\u2019s CEO:\n\n\u201cOur performance this quarter was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. Our Q2 total company revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales declined 4% year-over-year, driven by a negative 3% comp growth in North America, led by declining traffic and a negative 11% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins contracted by 140 basis points to 12.8%, and our overall earnings per share declined by 7% to $0.68. While these results do not reflect our strengths, our capabilities or the opportunities ahead, we confront these challenges from a position of enduring strength.\u201d\n\nHowever, the following is what Rachel Ruggeri had to say about how the company views the current situation:\n\n\u201cFirst, Q2 was a challenging quarter for us as headwinds consistently persisted throughout the quarter leading us to revamp our actions and response plans to both unlock and attract demand. Second, our triple shot strategy continues to deliver efficiencies even in the face of headwinds reinforcing that we have the right strategy at the right time. Next, our fiscal year 2024 guidance has been revised to reflect our Q2 performance, year-to-date results as well as the near-term headwinds we\u2019re experiencing. We, however, remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity and thus, committed to our strategy and the related investments. And finally, our disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude, reflecting shareholder commitment underpinned by our best-in-class dividends.\n\nThis allows us, to preserve both balance sheet durability and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate this complex and dynamic environment.\u201d\n\nOverall SBUX ranks 1st on our list of the best restaurant stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Todayto see the other restaurant stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of SBUX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "McDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD): The Best Restaurant Stock to Buy Today?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against the other restaurant stocks.\n\nCurrently, quite a bit of anxiety is struck by restaurant stocks in the market, as the Russell index that tracks restaurants experienced a 6% fall since March 2024. Other sectors, like industrials, and materials, to name a few, are experiencing a similar struggle as restaurants. This situation, as a whole, is indicative of potential late-cycle market issues marked by the market\u2019s slow growth in general, which is driven by consumer distress in the U.S. in a larger sense.\n\nMoreover, amidst this inflation-stricken market, restaurants in the U.S. are in quite a bit of a meal deal war, hoping to fulfill the customers\u2019 need for affordability. As such, Sonic, a drive-in fast-food chain headquartered in Oklahoma, U.S., is the newest member to join the war, as it has introduced a $1.99 value menu, boasting a selection of various food items.\n\nPreviously, Taco Bell and Burger King have already introduced their discounted meal deals, showcasing various brands\u2019 dire attempts to attract customers in the given circumstances. Moreover, this is also driven by increased food and wage costs in the market, pushing down the margins of various restaurant brands, according to analysts. The Consumer Price Index has risen at a cumulative rate of 20.8% since February 2020, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Thus, this explains why restaurant ETFs and stocks have started off the third quarter on a lower note.\n\nNevertheless, there\u2019s bright hope as the global fast food, which goes hand-in-hand with the restaurant industry, is set to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% from 2023 to 2032, expected to reach $1 trillion by then. Furthermore, one can keep their hopes high, as it is reported that a staggering 37% of the U.S. population is a consumer of fast food. For the fast-food market, the millennial segment is one that it must rely on the most, as 54% of this segment steps toward fast-food chains once or twice every week. You can check out our article about the 20 Fast Food Chains with Most Locations in the World.\n\nOn the other hand, according to the National Restaurant Association, the U.S. restaurant industry is forecasted to result in $1.1 trillion worth of sales in the year 2024. This will translate into the employment of 15.7 million Americans. However, amidst the supply chain inefficiencies and rising costs, it would be challenging for restaurant operators to make profits, and technology is expected to play a decisive role in determining the winners and losers of the market in the coming time, according to market analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, it\u2019s essential to know where to put your money, when it comes to the restaurant market. Hence, now we will take you to our list of 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today, we gathered a list of all companies with a significant presence in the restaurant industry.

The biggest chunk of this belongs to Citadel Investment Group and Bridgewater Associates, who have investments of $665 million and $343.4 million, respectively.\n\nThis year hasn't been very kind to MCD investors. The stock was trading above the $300 mark in January and currently sits at $250. Twenty-one years ago, during another fast food price war episode we remember MCD shares trading at $15. Recessions and price wars aren't new to MCD and MCD shares may even lose more than half of its value, but it has proven to be a survivor over the last two decades. Currently it trades at a P/E of 21 which isn't very expensive at all for this stable dividend stock either. If you don't mind short-term volatility, MCD is a good long-term investment at its current price. It won't make you rich, but it won't disappoint you over the next 10-20 years. However, if you are a little bit greedy like us, you can be more patient and try to pick up MCD shares at lower prices over the next 12 months or so. Right now, the bears are in charge of the MCD shares and they think consumers at the low end of the income distribution have less disposable income to spend on restaurants. What they don't remember is the fact that MCD shares declined by around 20% during the 2008-2009 recession while the broader market's drawdown was around 50%.\n\nOverall MCD ranks 2nd on our list of the best restaurant stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Todayto see the other restaurant stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of MCD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Don\u2019t count the metaverse out just yet. While it started as a costly failure, companies are racing to use it, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nFor example,\u00a0McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) metaverse just debuted in Singapore, which will allow users to build virtual burgers, envision future McDonald\u2019s restaurant designs and participate in contests that will reward users with real food deals and prizes.\n\nIKEA is launching a virtual universe on\u00a0Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). In fact, its \u201cThe Co-Worker Game\u201d will allow users \u201cto live their home furnishing dreams and get paid for it.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) metaverse experience includes virtual roller coasters, mazes and games.\u00a0\u201cBringing Six Flags to Roblox has enabled us to create a one-of-a-kind metaverse experience that will engage and entertain our fans in innovative ways,\u201d said\u00a0Selim Bassoul, CEO of Six Flags.\n\nEven The Rolling Stones are also debuting their music in the metaverse.\n\nBut this is just the start of the metaverse growth story. With demand only set to grow for virtual experiences in entertainment and gaming, analysts at SkyQuest say the metaverse market could be worth nearly $803.3 billion by 2031 from $86.31 billion in 2023.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s time to jump into some of the top metaverse stocks, including:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy is Roblox.\n\nAfter gapping from about $40 to a low of $30 on poor earnings, Roblox is back to $37.77, where it\u2019s still a buy. Initially, I\u2019m looking for it to refill its bearish gap at $40. Longer term, I\u2019d like to see the stock rally back to at least $45 on improving earnings.\n\nHelping, recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie, for example, just initiated coverage of RBLX with an outperform rating, noting it\u2019s one of the main \u201cbuilding blox\u201d of the metaverse.\n\n\u201cIn our view, there is still a long runway for growth ahead, driven by user growth, better monetization, international penetration and a new advertising initiative,\u201d they added, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nMoffett Nathanson also upgraded the stock to a neutral rating with a $26 price target following the massive sell off in the stock.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a buy on weakness.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips, and strong earnings growth, it\u2019s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/foxconn-digital-twin-ai/\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its\u00a0new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nEven more impressive, according to VentureBeat.com:\n\n\u201cSuch twins enable a company to design a factory in digital form through Omniverse simulations anchored by Nvidia\u2019s chips. The engineers designing the factory can get feedback from the simulation about how good the design is. Once it is perfected, they can build the factory in the real world. And with sensors on the factory, they can get digital information about how good the design really is and then modify the digital design in a feedback loop for continuous improvement.\u201d\n\nAll of which makes shares of Nvidia even more attractive following its 10:1 split.\n\nFidelity Metaverse ETF (FMET) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you\u2019d rather diversify with 53 metaverse stocks at less than $31 a share, there\u2019s the Fidelity Metaverse ETF (NASDAQ:FMET).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.39%, the ETF tracks the Fidelity Metaverse Index, which tracks the performance of companies that\u00a0develop, manufacture, distribute, or sell products or services related to establishing and enabling the metaverse.\n\nSome of its top holdings include heavyweights like Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nBetter, thanks to the explosive nature of these top stocks, the FMET ETF ran from a recent low of about $26 to $30.94, where it\u2019s still a buy. From its last traded price of $30.94, I\u2019d like to see it test at least $40 a share.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Given the current market conditions, you\u2019d want to consider offloading some Dow Stocks to sell before dragging your portfolio down further.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indices have soared by double-digit margins in the past 12 months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags with a modest 3.8% increase. The Dow\u2019s performance has been weighed down by underperforming giants among its 30 components, which sparked fresh demands for a makeover of the prolific index.\n\nOn the flip side, we\u2019ve witnessed a monumental tech-driven rally that has effectively bypassed traditional, blue-chip companies that dominate the Dow. The market\u2019s focus is skewed towards AI-powered tech stocks that notched up record gains last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHence, it would be prudent for those looking to curb their downside risk to rotate out of these three Dow stocks. These stocks are up against multiple headwinds and have performed sluggishly of late, pointing to limited upside potential ahead.\n\nNike (NKE) NKE stock: A photograph of the storefront of a Nike store.\n\nSource: Square Box Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a powerhouse in athletic apparel and footwear but is now under major duress. The firm has dominated global markets for decades but faces major challenges now. Over the past year, its management has raised concerns over weakening consumer demand in North America, a slow recovery in the Chinese market, and growing competition weighing down the business.\n\nMoreover, its most recent quarterly earnings print cash a shadow over the entire sector. Recently, fourth-quarter (Q4) sales and first-quarter (Q1) projections for fiscal year (FY) 2025 fell below expectations. During Nike\u2019s Q4 earnings call, CEO John Donahoe predicted revenue declines in the mid-single-digit range in FY25.\n\nIn efforts to control the bleeding, the company has initiated belt-tightening measures, including reducing its workforce by about 2%. This move is part of the broader effort to streamline operations and curb production costs as the company braces for top-and-bottom-line declines this year.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0has seen its stock jump north of 30% in the past year, fueled largely by AI initiatives. However, despite multiple announcements of AI advancements and strategic partnerships, these initiatives have yet to result in significant revenue growth. The firm continues facing challenges in transforming its AI hype into tangible financial success, with its sales growth languishing behind its historical averages.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, its reliance on mergers and acquisitions rather than organic growth continues to raise concerns. It\u2019s shelling out billions like its most recent $7 billion deal to acquire cloud company HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP). Consequently, this approach continues diluting shareholder value while further draining IBM\u2019s cash reserves.\n\nCoupled with a declining dividend yield, these factors make IBM a relatively unattractive bet for yield-focused investors. It\u2019s currently yielding 3.85% on a trailing-twelve-month (TTM) basis, 20% behind its 5-year average. Hence, IBM\u2019s current positioning casts a shadow over its appeal amid an uncertain investing landscape.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's (MCD) building with logo at sunset\n\nSource: ATIKAN PORNCHAIPRASIT / Shutterstock.com\n\nFast-food giant, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) faces a shaky near-term future with tensions rising in the Middle East and commodity prices soaring.\n\nThe firm witnessed a marked slowdown in its Q1 performance, with global comparable sales creeping up by just 1.9%, missing the 2.3% analyst expectations. The discrepancy is starker when compared to the previous year\u2019s robust 12.6% growth.\n\nMoreover, the fast-food bellwether is facing major challenges due to ongoing food price inflation, which is impacting consumer spending and the affordability of MCD\u2019s menu items. This inflationary pressure has compelled MCD to raise prices, limiting its value appeal, which it is known for.\n\nFurthermore, the Middle East conflict has had a considerable impact on its business, with questions over the future. The concerns surrounding the region have effectively dimmed the bright spots seen in markets like Japan and Europe. Globally, the firm is grappling with only modest growth and tough competition, complicating its operational landscape. With these diverse geopolitical challenges, MCD is steering through a potentially rocky future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "The total return for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years",
        "content": "While McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 10% in the last quarter. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. In that time, it is up 17%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 96%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 16% drop, in the last year.\n\nWhile the stock has fallen 3.7% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, McDonald's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.4% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 3% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, McDonald's' TSR for the last 5 years was 31%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in McDonald's had a tough year, with a total loss of 14% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 24%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - McDonald's has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Low-Priced Fintech Stocks You Better Not Sleep On",
        "content": "At their heart, fintech stocks are about leveraging technology to improve and automate the delivery of financial services. The word fintech is a shortened combination of financial technology and is often equated with payments technology and other applications that make life easier.\n\nIt\u2019s an area projected to continue growing at an annual rate of 16.5% between 2024 and 2032. That rapid growth rate is one of the primary reasons investors are so keen to learn about the best stocks in the sector.\n\nThe fintech sector has lagged behind the overall market in 2024. As disappointing as that is, it also suggests there is room for fintech to rebound moving forward. That somewhat weak performance also implies there are deals to be had. There are several low-priced and undervalued opportunities for investors to consider at this point. Let\u2019s take a look at three fintech stocks that appear to be well positioned currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is one of the forefathers of the fintech stock segment and one that\u2019s currently low priced.\n\nThe company made its name through the Square point-of-sale systems that lend the stock its ticker name. Although Square generated $820 million in gross profits in the first quarter, it is no longer the firm\u2019s main priority. Cash App generated $1.2 billion in gross profits during the same period and now defines the company along with its blockchain aspirations.\n\nWhatever the focal segment, Block continues to be fintech oriented. The company is heavily associated with Bitcoin. Despite concerns by investors that Block spends too much time and money on Bitcoin, it\u2019s hard to argue that the company isn\u2019t concerned with financial technology first and foremost.\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to argue with the notion that Block stock is low priced at the moment. The analysts covering Block believe that its shares are worth more than $87 on average. Shares currently trade for $63.\n\nAdyen (ADYEY) ADYEY - Adyen headquarters in Amsterdam\n\nSource: www.hollandfoto.net / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdyen (OTCMKTS:ADYEY) is a Netherlands based global processing platform and an undervalued fintech stock to consider.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the company is in the midst of a large opportunity based on its most recent earnings report. That report showed that Adyen\u2019s revenues grew by 21% in the period on processing volumes that increased by 46%.\n\nThe company continues to experience volume acceleration with its large enterprise partners. Adyen is the mobile app partner ofMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and processes all of its transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, revenues are expected to grow by approximately 11% at the firm in 2024. However, earnings growth is expected to outpace top line growth during the same period, at 29%. Earnings growth is one of the most influential factors in raising a given stock\u2019s market price. Thus, it\u2019s reasonable to anticipate that Adyen could increase in price moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019ll be an interesting one to watch because the shares are slightly down year-to-date. There certainly is some value given the company\u2019s performance. It\u2019s a matter of when the markets choose to recognize that value.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Warren Buffett face art style isolated template design warren buffet white background. Strong Buy Warren Buffett Stocks\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is a stock that has a place in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio of holdings. Buffett is known to prefer financial stocks and this digital banking platform serving Brazil and parts of Latin America is one that he likes.\n\nNu Holdings is one of many so-called neobanks. They offer a whole host of ancillary services beyond those from traditional banks. It\u2019s part of the reason that Nu Holdings has grown so rapidly, surpassing the 100 million customer mark during the first quarter.\n\nThat rapid growth and rapid customer acquisition as it resulted in rapidly rising share prices year-to-date. NU stock traded for $8 at the beginning of 2024 and is rapidly approaching $13.\n\nThese companies are entering into all kinds of related industries including the travel sector and mobile networks. The idea is to build a sort of one-stop shop API that brings more and more banking into the mobile realm.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Long Haul Stocks to Create Lasting Wealth",
        "content": "Creating long-term wealth in the stock market is fundamentally simple: Pick a time-tested strategy, stick to it, sell your losers and ride out the winners, be patient and keep investing. It sounds relatively simple and it is but the question of which long haul stocks are likely to create wealth still arises.\n\nHistory has shown again and again that identifying sure winners is not as easy as it appears. Simply consider the stocks of companies that dominated several decades ago that no longer exist or are nearly bankrupt. Radio shack comes to mind, and retailers like Kmart also deserve a mention.\n\nThe point is that the brands and stocks that appear to be long-term winners sometimes turn out not to be. That makes establishing a long-term position difficult when times get tough. Just remember, do your research and stick to your plan. Long-term wealth doesn\u2019t come from abandoning a plan when things get dicey. Then you\u2019re trying to time the market which rarely works.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best tech stocks to consider in the quest to build wealth for the long haul.\n\nOf course, we can simply look back at its performance over the past 10 years and use that to suggest that it will continue to win. It has returned an average of nearly 29% over the past decade so it\u2019s hard to argue against Microsoft. It has returned an even more impressive 36% over the past 12 months.\n\nThat increased rate of return is an obvious product of Microsoft\u2019s strength in relation to artificial intelligence. The company invested early and heavily into AI and has reaped the benefits. Those benefits appear especially in Microsoft\u2019s cloud division, Azure, where growth has outpaced top line results.\n\nThat\u2019s the overarching point here, and the reason investors should look to Microsoft as a long haul stock to create long-term wealth: Microsoft was already a behemoth and got that much more powerful as a result of the early AI surge.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cans\n\nSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has long been recognized as a long-term stock worthy of investment. However, I believe some investors may have begun to question the validity of that assertion as global tastes shift.\n\nWhat I\u2019m referring to specifically is the shift away from sugary, carbonated beverages toward healthier alternatives. Sugar is more demonized than it has ever been. In turn, Coca-Cola should logically be at risk.\n\nHowever, the company isn\u2019t at risk and that truth is borne out through a few simple metrics. If Coca-Cola were in trouble it would show in the company\u2019s gross margins. The company wouldn\u2019t be as capable of charging higher prices if demand were worsening and that would show up as weaker margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola\u2019s gross margins are just about exactly where they\u2019ve been for the past 10 years. Much higher than the majority of competitors and very steady overall. Coca-Cola is one of a few buy and hold stocks that will cause no heartache and continuously reward through dividend income. It\u2019s as easy a choice as ever.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) satisfies one of the oldest maxims of investing: Dividends reinvested create long-term, compounding wealth that rich stock investors love.\n\nThis recent article spells out an exact scenario in which O stock is held over the last 10 years. It lays out the returns under a dividend reinvestment plan and one on which dividends are collected as cash. Unsurprisingly, the dividend reinvestment plan yields greater returns overall. Yet, the returns while collecting cash are also strong.\n\nI\u2019d recommend following the dividend reinvestment plan especially given the fact that O stock pays a monthly dividend that increases the frequency of compounding opportunities. However, that cash in hand can be used to seek other long-term wealth building opportunities as well.\n\nThe company continues to thrive and recently raised its earnings and investment guidance. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was increased as well. That\u2019s where dividends are paid from in real estate investment trusts (REITs) including Realty Income. It all continues to look very strong for the company as an investment.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a 10X stock. That\u2019s true of the shares of the last decade during which it has provided average annual returns of 26.4%. That means that $1,000 invested in Apple a decade ago is now worth more than $10,000.\n\nWe aren\u2019t living in the past though and the markets are forever forward looking. Until very recently, those markets were not particularly fond of Apple and its stock. That changed when Apple delivered good news at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n\nThe company unveiled its much anticipated take on AI, Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be more pragmatic and geared toward user experience primarily. That is in opposition to other tech firms where a land grab approach has dominated early on.\n\nThe addition of AI to the iPhone is particularly important to Apple and its stock. It is expected that updated, AI capable iPhones will revive slumping sales of late. Even if AI doesn\u2019t spike iPhone sales immediately, they will return as the economy improves on rate cuts later this year.\u00a0Apple has proven to be a winner for the long haul through its ability to create products that have mass appeal and create a cult like following.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are dozens of things to potentially talk about in relation to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock and its long-term outlook. Let\u2019s focus on its strength versus other U.S. Oil Majors and how the company is approaching the energy transition. Both of those factors, when combined, suggest that Exxon Mobil is an excellent long-term wealth building investment.\n\nMost energy investors are going to go one of two ways when it comes to overall strategy: They\u2019ll invest in green-leaning European energy firms or side with fossil fuel dominated American firms. Those who find more appeal in the latter category will likely whittle their choice down to Exxon Mobil and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). I\u2019d suggest choosing XOM because the company is far better at investing capital than its competitor. That ability to reap a higher return on invested capital than cost is referred to as \u2018value creation\u2019. Exxon Mobil excels in that regard.\n\nThat suggests to me that Exxon Mobil is particularly adept at reading market trends over time and investing appropriately. I can only imagine that the company will be better than its competition as it relates to directing capital during the energy transition as well.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.\n\nSource: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is the best-positioned of the major tobacco stocks for the next 10 years. For that reason, I believe it\u2019s also the best choice to deliver long-term wealth to investors.\n\nAll of the major tobacco stocks are undergoing a massive, transitory period during which cigarette smoking has fallen and these companies have been forced to pivot.\n\nHowever, it is Philip Morris that has handled the transition best. Over the past five years its share prices are up 32%. That\u2019s not great when compared to the broader market but it is much better than Altria (NYSE:MO) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), both of which have fallen during the same period.\n\nPhilip Morris has introduced products that meet changing consumer demand profiles including the incredibly popular Zyn nicotine pouches. The company can\u2019t even keep up with demand for the product.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the broader narrative suggesting that Philip Morris is a great buy and hold stock. It provides a strong dividend and is managing the tobacco transition very well.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock has certainly been much stronger in the past. The company is facing issues from multiple angles and currently trades for less than $260 per share after beginning 2024 at $297.\n\nWhether it\u2019s boycotts related to the Middle East or claims of rampant price gouging, McDonald\u2019s has certainly seen better days. McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t expect the effects of those boycotts to worsen demand further but also expects no improvement until the war ends. Some believe the war to be unwinnable and that a peace accord could soon materialize as a result.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also recently released its popular $5 value meal that includes a McDouble or a McChicken, a four piece nugget, small fries, and a small drink. The company is running the promotion in response to claims that it had gotten too expensive during the ongoing inflationary period. Its release should spike sales and are expected to produce profits at the same time.\n\nThose factors suggest McDonald\u2019s should rebound in the short term. It still plans to grow rapidly in the near future and the company wants to reach 50,000 global locations by 2027. If McDonald\u2019s achieves that goal it will be the fastest period of expansion in company history.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald's Says Beyond Meat Burger Test Failed. What Could It Mean for Investors?",
        "content": "It's been a difficult few years for Beyond Meat's (NASDAQ: BYND) stock, which is down 96% over the past five years, including falling 23% year to date.\n\nThe company recently received more negative headlines when McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) discussed how two test markets using its plant-based burgers had failed.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the news, the issues the company has been facing, and what investors should do with the stock.\n\nA lack of demand\n\nMcDonald's recently came out and said that its test of the McPlant burger, which used patties from Beyond Meat, had failed in its test markets. The plant-based burgers were being served in about 600 locations in the San Francisco and Dallas-Fort Worth markets. However, the news is more about the headlines, as the fast-food giant was testing the burgers back in 2022. The company noted that there just was not much demand for the burger, even in a more vegetarian market like San Francisco.\n\nWhile the news will not have any impact on Beyond Meat's sales going forward, it does speak directly to one of the company's biggest problems: Demand for its products is shrinking.\n\nThis could be seen in its most-recent quarterly results, where volume of Beyond Meat's products sold fell 16% to 16.57 million pounds. The company sales volumes declined across its segments, with U.S. retail volumes down 10% to 7.47 million pounds and U.S. food service volumes sinking nearly 21% to 2.20 million pounds.\n\nWhile the U.S. market has been a continued struggle for Beyond Meat for quite some time, the company has done much better internationally, especially in the food service part of its business. For example, international food service volumes climbed nearly 60% last year, while sales rose 34%.\n\nHowever, that strong performance evaporated in Q1. In the first quarter, international food service sales volumes plummeted 25% to 4.16 million pounds. International retail sales volumes, meanwhile, fell 13% to 2.91 million pounds.\n\nBesides declining demand for its products, Beyond Meat also has a pricing and margin problem as well. While sales volumes have been declining, revenue in dollar terms has fallen even more. In Q1, while overall volumes fell 16%, dollar-based revenue fell even more by 18%. Last year, meanwhile, while volumes dropped 8%, revenue plunged 18%.\n\nGross margins have been very low. In Q1, they were a paltry 4.9%. With declining volumes and sales, the company is seeing operating deleverage in its business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDebt is coming due in 2027\n\nNot surprisingly, the company is burning cash as well. In Q1, it had operating cash flow of -$31.8 million, while it was -$107.8 million in 2023. It also has an outstanding convertible note of over $1.1 billion that, while sporting an attractive 0% interest rate, will likely need to be settled in cash come March 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the current state of the company's operations, being able to refinance that debt seems unlikely. As such, the need to seek bankruptcy protection within a few years is a real possibility unless the company can change its fortunes.\n\nThe company is currently using an at-the-market (ATM) program to raise cash through the sale of its stock. This is diluting shareholders while trying to raise enough cash to eventually try and settle the principal amount of that note.\n\nThus, while the McDonald's news may not exactly be fresh, it certainly can be seen as a reflection of Beyond Meat's struggles. Meanwhile, there are bigger issues ahead, with Beyond Meat's international market turning negative and a lot of debt coming due in a few years.\n\nAs such, I think it is best that investors avoid the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Beyond Meat right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Beyond Meat, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Beyond Meat wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Returns on Capital Paint A Bright Future For McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)",
        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) look very promising so lets take a look.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for McDonald's:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$12b \u00f7 (US$54b - US$4.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 10%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for McDonald's  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for McDonald's .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nMcDonald's is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 21% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nTo bring it all together, McDonald's has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 36% to shareholders. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.\n\nOn a final note, we've found  2 warning signs for McDonald's that we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Fast food chains lean into value this summer. Will it be enough to boost their lagging stocks?",
        "content": "Value is on the menu this summer.\n\nRestaurant chains such as Taco Bell (YUM), McDonald\u2019s (MCD), KFC, and Burger King (QSR) have been leaning into value deals this summer in hopes of getting Americans to visit their restaurants more often and spend more when they do.\n\nIt's an attempt to turn around the narrative that fast food has gotten too expensive. Quick-service restaurant sales have finally started to flag after chains hiked prices over the past few years to offset higher labor and commodity costs, deterring diners, especially lower-income consumers.\n\nThat shift has been reflected in the hit to restaurant stocks this year. Shares of McDonald's and Wendy's (WEN) are both down 13% year to date, while shares of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International are down 11.3% and YUM! Brands is up just 1%.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX), which calls itself an affordable luxury, is now struggling to encourage investors it still is, with shares down 18% in 2024. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), meanwhile, is up nearly 15%.\n\nEnter value meals \u2014 which Wall Street pros say could boost foot traffic but lower margins.\n\nMany will be watching closely throughout July, which Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer called a \"pivotal month for the fast food industry,\" for proof that the \"$5 meal bundle is enough to accelerate industry sales.\"\n\nThe limited-time value deal comes down to a simple proposition: When value strategies work, it's because increased foot traffic offsets lower margins to bring in more dollars, Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop said. Consumers adding more items to their checks also helps.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to \u2026 repeat visits after the fact,\u201d R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cYou're not making money on the value menu. You're making menu money on the other products, the more premium products, the dessert products, the beverage products that go along with that.\u201d Customers place orders at a McDonald's restaurant at a shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on April 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Vincent Thian) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhile consumers may be happy about the cheaper prices, it's not guaranteed to be a good deal for fast food companies. And more competitors in the value arena could lead to no clear winner in the end.\n\n\"A value war is good for no one,\" Dunlop said. \"It's also the typical reaction that we see when industry traffic slows down. ... Everyone's dominant strategy when traffic is down is to promote, discount, and lean into value, but all players lose if their peers also make that choice.\"\n\nValue battle heats up\n\nOn Thursday, Taco Bell was the latest quick-service restaurant to introduce a value offering. With a name that plays on the idea that fast food is now a luxury, the $7 Luxe Box menu includes a Chalupa Supreme taco, beefy five-layer burrito, double-stacked taco, chips and nacho cheese sauce, and a medium drink.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company said the bundle provides a 55% discount on the total price of the items if they were bought separately. And Nola Krieg, who is behind product development at Taco Bell, said the box echoes previous $5 box deals the taco chain has offered since the late 2000s.\n\n\"What we found is an opportunity to give consumers an ... abundant meal at a price that everybody can afford, at $7,\u201d Taco Bell chief marketing officer Taylor Montgomery told Yahoo Finance, also hinting that other chains' value offerings may not be as hearty. Taco Bell introduces the $7 Luxe Box menu, which includes a Chalupa Supreme, Beefy Five-Layer Burrito, Double Stacked Taco, chips & Nacho Cheese sauce, and a medium drink. (Yahoo Finance at Taco Bell HQ in Irvine, Calif.)\n\nTaco Bell's offering compares to others rolling out across fast food. McDonald's $5 value menu, which began Tuesday, includes the choice of a McDouble burger or McChicken sandwich in addition to a four-piece chicken McNuggets, small fries, and a small soft drink.\n\nSimilarly, KFC's $4.99 meal offers two pieces of chicken, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, and a biscuit, while Burger King\u2019s $5 Your Way Meal includes the choice of a Chicken Jr., Whopper Jr., or bacon cheeseburger to go with fries, nuggets, and a drink.\n\nWendy's also sweetened the deal for its $5 Biggie Bag, an ongoing deal introduced five years ago, by throwing in a free Frosty. And even Starbucks is offering a \u201cpairing menu.\u201d For $5 or $6, customers can get a small iced or hot coffee with a butter croissant or breakfast sandwich.\n\nAnd while promotions are back in a big way, this tasty competition isn't new in the industry.\n\nIn 2016, McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's competed over price. McDonald's had its McPick $2 menu, Burger King had a five-for-$4 meal deal, and Wendy's had a four-for-$4 deal. All saw a 3% to 5% sales boost in the first quarter of 2016.\n\nFast food back in focus\n\nSo, is it working this time around? Preliminary results show these deals just might be.\n\nOver the \u201clast two weeks in particular, we started to see [fast food restaurants] come back into the focus of a lot of consumers as these value menus rolled out,\u201d Hottovy said, adding that this \u201cextreme value is really resonating with consumers right now.\u201d\n\nBurger King is \u201cdefinitively\u201d seeing positive traction from its $5 promotion, Hottovy noted, while Wendy\u2019s ongoing $5 Biggie Bag and Frosty freebie seem to be luring customers in too.\n\nMost of these runs are for a limited time only, though, so time will tell if these promotions play out favorably for fast food giants, especially as grocery stores and casual dining chains like Cava (CAVA), Chipotle (CMG), and Sweetgreen (SG) offer customers competitive alternatives.\n\nIf the deals aren't compelling enough to boost traffic, the chains may be reluctant to renew them.\n\n\u201cIt's reasonable to expect that [if] franchisees do not see incrementality in profit, they're going to be pushing back, and they're going to be unhappy with signing off on a ... subsequent promotion,\u201d Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance.\n\nEvercore's Palmer believes the success of these deals comes down to who can best communicate them to consumers.\n\n\"We suspect the answer will come in the advertising effectiveness \u2014 will it leverage McDonald\u2019s $1 billion national advertising budget?\" he wrote. \"Should McDonald\u2019s be able to stabilize traffic with value in 3Q the steady stream of new products in 2H24 and 2025 should kick off a substantial brand recovery.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The 3 Smartest Dow Stocks to Buy With $1000 Right Now",
        "content": "While investors often overlook the Dow Jones Industrial Average in favor of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, the Dow comprises some of the highest-quality businesses in the world. The top Dow stocks to buy represent a broad spectrum of industries and are known for their stability, resilience, and potential for steady growth.\n\nUnlike the more volatile tech-heavy indices, the Dow\u2019s components tend to be established firms with strong track records. This makes Dow stocks to buy as an excellent starting point for investors to generate stock ideas, especially those new to the market and looking to put their first few thousand dollars to work.\n\nGiven that I already regard most Dow components as high-quality businesses, my criteria for selecting Dow stocks to buy focused on identifying the most attractively priced Dow stocks relative to their growth prospects. With broad indices, including the Dow, having already recorded substantial gains lately, it\u2019s essential to seek out reasonably priced stocks to ensure a decent margin of safety. The following three names offer an excellent blend of value, quality, and growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nIn my view, the most compelling investment opportunity amongst the Dow Jones components today is McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). The most prominent player in the quick-service restaurant space, boasting over 41,000 locations worldwide,\u00a0has seen its shares decline by about 12.5% in 2024, underperforming the Dow Jones and the overall market. The stock\u2019s decline can be attributed to the market pricing in an affordability crisis, as even fast food seems rather expensive these days, with the cost of food ingredients and labor having surged lately.\n\nWhile these concerns are valid, McDonald\u2019s operating results remain largely resilient. Despite a modest slowdown, with same-store sales rising by just 1.9% in the company\u2019s most recent Q1 report, this period marked the 13th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. A short-term halt from McDonald\u2019s usual mid-single-digit growth rates is understandable. If anything, the fact that same-store sales haven\u2019t dipped and continue to grow from already high levels is impressive.\n\nIn the meantime, following its recent dip, McDonald\u2019s stock trades at just 21x this year\u2019s expected earnings per share, below its historical average. I think this multiple presents a notable margin of safety and potential for meaningful upside, especially considering Wall Street expects McDonald\u2019s EPS growth to accelerate in the high single digits to low double digits over the medium term.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother compelling investment opportunity within the Dow to consider buying following its drop in the past year is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). As one of the largest and most diversified healthcare giants globally, Johnson & Johnson stock rarely trades at a discount. Investors have historically been willing to pay a premium for a stake in the company due to its numerous qualities, including its 49-year dividend growth track record.\n\nGiven the legendary reputation Johnson & Johnson has earned among investors, it stands out as an excellent choice, whether you are making your first $1,000 investment or adding another $1,000 to your portfolio. The stock has consistently performed well for decades, and I don\u2019t see this trend changing anytime soon.\n\nWhenever you can buy shares at a discount, as is currently the case with the company trading at a forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14x, notably below its historical average of around 17x to 18x, it is wise to take advantage of the discount.\n\nIn the meantime, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s overall growth remains quite strong. The company increased its adjusted EPS by 12.4% in Q1, while consensus estimates see sustained EPS growth in the mid-single digits over the medium term. Given the company\u2019s tendency to beat analyst estimates, these numbers further expose why the stock\u2019s current valuation is rather attractive.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nI will wrap this list with UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), another laggard within the Dow worth considering. Shares are down roughly 11% in 2024, with UNH stock falling considerably behind its index peers. Still, UNH stock is also a name that rarely trades at a discounted valuation, so any such share price lags are potential opportunities worth examining.\n\nThis seems to be the case, with UNH stock now trading at a highly compelling valuation despite its robust growth prospects. In its Q1 results, UNH grew revenues by nearly 9% to $99.8 billion. Its adjusted EPS also grew by a notable 10.4% to $6.91, with the company recording an adjusted operating margin expansion and share repurchases, further aiding the growth of this figure. This top and bottom line growth matches UNH\u2019s historical trends, suggesting sustained growth with no signs of a slowdown.\n\nWith UNH\u2019s growth remaining robust against a lagging share price, the stock has compressed its valuation to rather attractive levels. At 17.4x this year\u2019s expected adjusted EPS, I believe that UNH stock provides a potent mix of safety and upside, particularly with double-digit earnings growth persisting. With the possibility of a P/E expansion adding to future return prospects, UNH is certainly a stock worth your next $1000.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "California's iconic In-N-Out raised prices after minimum wage hike \u2014 but drive-through lines remain healthy\n\nFor many burger lovers, In-N-Out ranks as one of their top go-to spots. However, if you visit one of its locations in California, the chain\u2019s home state, you might notice that the prices have recently increased.\n\nThe reason has to do with the minimum wage hike in the Golden State. On April 1, California raised the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour.\n\nDon't miss\n\nBeating the market is no myth: These expert stock-pickers' recent success could help you build generational wealth 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs \u2014 take advantage today These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nThe new law applies to fast food chains with 60 or more locations nationwide\n\nIn-N-Out, which has the majority of its over 400 outlets in California, implemented its price hike on the same day the new minimum wage went into effect.\n\n\u201cOn April 1, we raised our prices incrementally to accompany a pay raise for all of the Associates working in our California restaurants. The price increase was also necessary to maintain our quality standards,\u201d the private company said in a statement to KTVU Fox 2.\n\nLoyal fans of the chain don\u2019t seem to mind, though. Standing next to a long line of cars in the drive-through at In-N-Out\u2019s Alameda location, KTVU reporter Betty Yu noted that \u201cthis is not uncommon\u201d and \u201cthe demand for In-N-Out is strong.\u201d\n\nPittsburg resident Chris Hachlica, who eats at the burger chain every other week, told the television station, \u201cThe price increase? I understand, because the economy is kind of bad.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Birmingham from Alameda also understood the need for the price hike.\n\n\u201cI've always heard that In-N-Out treats their employees well. It seems like that's part of their branding and so we're definitely down to support that, especially in the Bay Area, when cost of living is so high,\u201d Birmingham told KTVU.\n\nYou know your burgers are delicious when customers sympathize with your price hikes. However, In-N-Out remains a private company, making it difficult for everyday investors to get involved.\n\nThe good news? Other fast food chains are also finding their footing in this inflationary environment. Here\u2019s a look at three of them.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nAt a time when several restaurants are facing closures and bankruptcies, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stands out: the company opened 47 new restaurants in Q1 of 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s also a market darling, as Chipotle shares have climbed over 46% in 2024. Over the last five years, the stock has surged by 348%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from this kind of share price performance, business is firing on all cylinders.\n\nIn Q1, Chipotle reported a 14.1% year over year increase in revenue to $2.7 billion, driven by new restaurant openings and a 7.0% rise in same store sales.\n\nFor full year 2024, the company plans to open 285 to 315 new restaurants and expects same store sales growth in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage.\n\nNote, that Chipotle has announced a 50-for-1 stock split, scheduled for June 26. Shareholders of record as of June 18, 2024 will receive 49 additional shares for each share they held, with the distribution occurring after market close on June 25.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief financial and administrative officer Jack Hartung commented that the stock split will make the stock \u201cmore accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors.\u201d\n\nRead more: \u2018You didn\u2019t want to risk it\u2019: 80-year-old woman from South Carolina is looking for the safest place for her family\u2019s $250,000 savings. Dave Ramsey responds\n\nRestaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR) came into existence in 2014 through the merger of Burger King and Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons. The company expanded its portfolio by acquiring Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in 2017 and Firehouse Subs in 2021.\n\nShares have had a choppy ride lately \u2014 they are down almost 10% year to date.\n\nDespite the fluctuations in the stock market, the company's operations appear robust. In Q1 of 2024, Restaurant Brands\u2019 revenue totaled $1.74 billion, marking a 9.4% increase year over year and beating Wall Street expectations. Same store sales grew 6.9% at Tim Hortons, 3.8% at Burger King, 5.7% at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and 0.3% at Firehouse Subs.\n\nHowever, the company's adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 73 cents, down from 75 cents in the prior-year period.\n\nDuring the earnings conference call, CEO Josh Kobza noted a shift in consumer behavior due to heightened price sensitivity. He emphasized the need to increase customer visits to the stores, stating, \u201cIn our own data we've seen consumers become a bit more sensitive to price resulting in moderating check growth. This is why driving traffic is so important and why I'm so pleased to see our brands deliver better traffic than most of the industry this past quarter.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\n\nAs the largest fast-food chain in the world, changes in McDonald\u2019s (MCD) menu prices \u2014 such as $18 Big Macs at one location \u2014 can make headlines.\n\nIn response to this, McDonald's USA president Joe Erlinger penned an open letter to the company\u2019s American \u201cfans.\u201d He wrote that the average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019 and \"despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures,\" the average cost is now $5.29. He added that it\u2019s the franchisees who set menu prices for their restaurants.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, the company's revenue grew 5% year over year to $6.17 billion. Adjusted earnings per share also improved \u2014 by 2% from a year ago to $2.70. However, earnings per share and both global and U.S. same store sales growth came below Wall Street expectations.\n\nMCD shares are down over 13% in 2024, but it can be argued that business is still heading in the right direction.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said the \"consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar\" and the firm will be \u201claser-focused\u201d on affordability as inflation puts pressure on the industry. That effort includes the launch of a new $5 meal deal for a limited time to make dining more affordable.\n\n\u201cWe heard our fans loud and clear \u2014 they\u2019re looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll get,\u201d Erlinger said in a statement.\n\nWhile the stock doesn\u2019t seem to be a market darling at the moment, the company has been a staple for many income investors \u2014 and for good reason. Since paying its first ever dividend in 1976, McDonald\u2019s has increased its payout every single year.\n\nAlso worth noting is that McDonald\u2019s business doesn\u2019t solely depend on its own restaurant sales. In the U.S., 95% of its restaurants are franchises, allowing the company to earn substantial revenue from franchise fees. Additionally, McDonald\u2019s often owns the buildings at many of these locations, providing a steady income stream from rental payments.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Enhanced Returns",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are regaining popularity in investment portfolios, a shift prompted by recent years of higher interest rates favoring fixed-income options over dividend yields. However, as investors return to dividend stocks, the criteria for evaluating these investments have evolved\u2014mirroring broader shifts in investment standards.\n\nToday\u2019s investors prioritize solid financial fundamentals, a stark contrast to the cheap debt era, when simple promises of future profits could draw substantial investment, often regardless of weak financial management. Now, with a more cautious approach, investors are steering clear of speculative stocks and seeking more robust financial backbones.\n\nThis heightened scrutiny is particularly relevant for dividend stocks. While investors demand stability from growth stocks, they also seek substantial long-term growth potential from their dividend-bearing investments. Despite short-term Treasuries offering yields above 5%, dividend stocks must offer higher yields or the potential for significant long-term capital gains\u2014or ideally both\u2014to distinguish themselves in a competitive landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) consistently ranks among the top dividend stocks to own indefinitely, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Known as a dividend aristocrat, Realty Income offers monthly distributions and a 5.8% yield, making it a perennial favorite among investors. After a nearly 20% decline over the past year, this dividend stock is now attractively priced for long-term investors. The company\u2019s core strengths remain unchanged, positioning it as a compounder for today\u2019s buyers.\n\nRealty Income maintains an impressive occupancy rate of over 98% across its properties, with the overwhelming majority of its retail tenants operating in sectors resilient to economic downturns. A substantial portion of these tenants are in the grocery sector, complemented by convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores, creating a diversified portfolio that is largely immune to economic volatility.\n\nThe company\u2019s triple-net lease model is particularly advantageous, as it transfers all operational risks and expenses, including property maintenance costs, to the tenants. This structure shields Realty Income from rising material and labor costs often associated with higher interest rates. Additionally, with leases typically spanning 15 years or more and including renewal options, Realty Income enjoys a reliable stream of rental income. The average lease term until renewal is a lengthy 9.8 years, providing the REIT with significant flexibility over the next decade, regardless of economic fluctuations.\n\nStory continues\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough tax season is behind us (unless you\u2019re a late filer), H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) remains a top dividend stock to buy year-round. Moving beyond the seasonal nature of tax services, H&R Block is diversifying its revenue streams to ensure steady cash flow throughout the year.\n\nTo counter the cyclical nature of the tax sector, H&R Block launched a mobile banking service that has quickly gained traction. The company has secured $456 million in net customer deposits and 316,000 customer signups in less than two years, filling a significant market gap. Additionally, H&R Block is leveraging new technologies for more efficient tax filing, collaborating with industry giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on an OpenAI-powered tax assistance product.\n\nH&R Block\u2019s appeal as a dividend stock is further enhanced by its impressive 10.25% total yield, which includes a respectable 2.4% dividend yield and substantial stock buybacks. Supported by a modest 29% payout ratio, this yield indicates that H&R Block retains a considerable portion of its earnings for growth initiatives while still providing significant returns to its shareholders.\n\nVICI Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nDreaming of a Las Vegas getaway? Investing in VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) could be your next smart move. This dividend stock holds ownership and occasional operations of some of Vegas\u2019s most iconic locations, including Caesar\u2019s Palace, the Venetian, and MGM Grand. VICI\u2019s extensive portfolio positions it as a strong investment, given Vegas\u2019s enduring global popularity.\n\nThe company became publicly traded in 2017 after Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) went through bankruptcy. Unlike Caesars Entertainment, which still manages Caesars Palace, VICI owns the actual real estate, allowing it to benefit from tourist and gambler spending without bearing the operational risks of its tenants.\n\nSince its IPO, VICI has provided a solid 60% return, with gross returns surpassing 120% when factoring in distributions. Over the last seven years, VICI has consistently offered a dividend yield of around 5%, with the current trailing yield at 5.9%. This robust yield, paired with promising growth prospects, makes VICI an excellent choice for dividend-focused investors.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) logo seen on billboard.is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States, and the Middle East. OXY stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to value investing, few can rival Warren Buffett. One dividend stock he currently favors is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Offering a 2.9% total yield with a 21% payout ratio, OXY provides substantial advantages for both income and growth investors.\n\nBuffett has notably increased his investment in Occidental Petroleum over the past few years, particularly in 2023, ultimately acquiring a 27% stake in the oil and gas giant, valued at more than $14.5 billion. And, despite shares trading fairly flat, Buffett just keeps buying. Though Occidental\u2019s net-zero and sustainability-focused projects promise a future energy pivot, the company continues to benefit from rising crude oil prices currently seen in the market.\n\nIn recent months, Occidental\u2019s share price has ranged between $55 and $65. Thanks to its strengths and the surge in crude prices, Occidental Petroleum is nearing new five-year highs. Following Buffett\u2019s lead on this dividend stock could be a wise move, as it offers a unique growth opportunity in a well-established industry.\n\nEdison International (EIX) Southern California Edison sign and logo EIX stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUtility companies often attract dividend investors due to their stable customer base, reliable financials, and tendency to redistribute profits to shareholders. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) stands out among these companies, especially as the company has strong growth potential that similarly mature utilities tend to lack.\n\nEdison International surpasses industry dividend averages by nearly 2% while consistently increasing its annual payout for the past 20 years. After hitting a low in October 2023, EIX\u2019s stock price rebounded significantly, growing 15% since then. However, the numbers only tell part of the story.\n\nOperating in California, Edison faces more stringent state regulatory challenges compared to its counterparts. But this could work to Edison\u2019s advantage.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s continued moves away from natural gas, despite questionable success thus far, and the rising demand for green energy practices in the state position Edison as one of the few utility firms with tangible growth prospects. While currently focused on southern California, the state\u2019s overall push for sustainability and carbon neutrality by 2045 suggests Edison has significant expansion potential.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a household name globally, yet investors often overlook its potential for dividend and income investing despite its continued growth potential, market power and 4.3% dividend yield.\n\nFrom a value investor\u2019s perspective, McDonald\u2019s is a mature and stable presence with an unrivaled market footprint. The company operates 38,000 locations in over 100 countries and offers investors geographic diversification, scaled operations, and a dependable cash flow. Its robust balance sheet and iconic brand provide a significant competitive edge, effectively deterring new market entrants. Additionally, McDonald\u2019s continues to embrace technological advancements and initiatives, focusing on digital and delivery capabilities, which positions it well for adapting to evolving consumer habits and potential future growth.\n\nFor income investors, McDonald\u2019s has a long and impressive history of paying and increasing dividends. It belongs to the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Impressively, McDonald\u2019s has increased its dividend for nearly 50 consecutive years, demonstrating a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders. This consistent and growing income stream makes it an ideal choice for those seeking stability and reliability in their dividend stock portfolio.\n\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery.

        "title": "Chipotle's 50-for-1 stock split just went into effect. Here's what it means for investors.",
        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) investors will notice a difference in their portfolios this morning.\n\nThe burrito giant conducted a 50-for-1 stock split, the company's first split ever and one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nChipotle CFO Jack Hartung told investors he believes this will make shares more \"accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors\" on a call following the company's first quarter results.\n\nShareholders who owned the stock as of the market close on June 18 received 49 additional shares for each one held. When the market opens Wednesday, shares will trade on a post-split basis, meaning one share worth $3,283.04 as of Tuesday's close will trade as 50 shares worth roughly $65.66 per share.\n\nPre-split, Chipotle stock was the third-highest-priced in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), after NVR, Inc. (NVR) and Booking Holdings (BKNG). Its post-split stock price is still higher than when the company went public in 2006 at $22 per share.\n\nBernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance that Chipotle could benefit from this split.\n\nOn one hand, this new entry point allows \"more access to retail investors\" who may have shied away from the high price prior to the split, Gargiulo said. But on the other hand, \"the stock could be exposed a little bit more to some level of volatility,\" he warned.\n\n\"I don't think it's ever going to be a meme stock, like GameStop or others in the past, but I think it does expose a little bit to more fluctuations,\" Gargiulo added.\n\nAs of Tuesday's market close, shares of Chipotle were up 43% year to date, compared to a nearly 15% gain from the S&P 500. A Chipotle restaurant stands in Manhattan on Feb. 6, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nSome Chipotle employees will reap the benefits of the split.\n\nApproximately 4,000 Chipotle employees, including restaurant general managers and crew members with more than 20 years of service, will receive a special one-time equity grant to commemorate the stock split, a Chipotle spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe grant will vest over three years. Additionally, US employees who have been with the company for one year can enroll in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which allows them to purchase shares at a discount. They also can elect to use between 1% and 15% of their compensation to help buy the stock.\n\nAnd Chipotle is not the only company conducting a stock split this year.\n\nAs Seana Smith reported following Nvidia's (NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month, stock splits are typically bullish for companies that conduct them, with average returns one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broader market, according to analysis from Bank of America.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart also recently conducted a 3-for-1 stock split. Since the stock split took effect on Monday, Feb. 26, shares of the retailer are up nearly 13%.\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) is out with its much-anticipated value menu.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Golden Arches rolled out its $5 meal deal, which includes the choice of a McDouble burger or McChicken sandwich, in addition to a four-piece chicken McNuggets, small fries, and a small soft drink.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s USA president Joe Erlinger said in a press release that the team is \"focused\" on affordable options as the company looks to bring customers back in the door. This comes after a rough first quarter, where US same-store sales were up 2.5%, slightly off the 2.55% expected, along with misses on revenue growth and same-store sales across all of the company's segments and earnings. McDonald's $5 meal deal (McDonald's/Graphic by Yahoo Finance)\n\nFranchisees hope that this deal, which will run for a limited time, will get consumers to visit McDonald's restaurants more. However, they also expect to take a hit on margins.\n\n\u201cValue promotions never increase margins \u2014 never,\u201d one McDonald\u2019s franchisee, who wished to remain anonymous, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThey do drive guest counts. Hopefully, the increase in guest counts will offset the slimmed-down margins.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said the value offering is the hook to get consumers back in the door. But, he added, it\u2019s important that the restaurant encourages customers to order premium or additional items to \u201creally help maximize the profitability.\u201d\n\nWhy now? McDonald's wants consumers to stop thinking the fast food chain is too expensive and show that it has the right offering for the right price.\n\nFollowing accusations that it has raised prices, Erlinger posted a blog to share the cost increases of the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder, among other items. The average prices of the two burgers have risen roughly 20% since 2019.\n\nMcDonald's is not alone; other chains are jumping in on the value craze too.\n\nIn early April, KFC (YUM) introduced a $4.99 meal that offers two pieces of chicken, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, and a biscuit. In late May, Burger King (QSR) brought back its $5 Your Way Meal, which includes the choice of a Chicken Jr., Whopper Jr., or Bacon Cheeseburger, fries, nuggets, and a drink.

        "content": "California franchise owners and consumers are feeling the brunt of higher costs.\n\nAfter 30 years in business, McDonald's franchisee and Rodrick Foods CEO Scott Rodrick had to make the difficult decision to not renew his lease at one of his McDonald's (MCD) locations at a mall in San Francisco.\n\n\"The unprecedented changes to the economic landscape of California, coupled with a host of ill-timed legislative mandates, greatly narrowed the restaurant\u2019s path to extending its tenure into a new term,\" Rodrick told Yahoo Finance. He added that an \"unbending landlord set on rent per square foot,\" high property taxes, and mall charges were additional reasons that \"made the decision difficult, but clear.\" A copy of the letter that Scott Rodrick posted to the restaurant's front door, telling Yahoo Finance, \"What an awful feeling that was.\" (Courtesy: Scott Rodrick/obtained by Yahoo Finance)\n\nRodrick still owns 17 other McDonald's locations but is bracing for further changes in the industry. His father was among the first to franchise a McDonald's location in the 1960s \u2014 a far different time for franchisees compared to now.\n\n\"An explosion has gone off in California,\" Rodrick said, referring to a series of closures of other longstanding franchises, including an In-N-Out location in Oakland and an Arby's restaurant in Hollywood that had stood for 55 years. \"We are going to be watching the shock waves pass through slowly over time.\"\n\nCalifornia's minimum wage law takes effect\n\nOne area of concern for owners of California's quick-service restaurants has been how to respond to new legislation.\n\nApril 1 marked day one of California's new fast food minimum wage law, which raised the starting wage for restaurant employees in the state to $20 per hour \u2014 from $16 previously \u2014 for chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide.\n\nAs franchise operators battle to maintain profitability, consumers have started voting with their feet about the higher prices. Overall, the cost to dine out jumped 4% year over year nationwide last month alone. In California, menu prices at fast food restaurants rose 10.12% between September and April, with the largest increase seen in April following the legislation.\n\nAccording to data analytics platform Placer.ai, foot traffic at McDonald's in California underperformed all US McDonald's locations by 2.48% in April and May compared to the same time last year. Prior to that, foot traffic was relatively the same.\n\nAb Igram, the executive director of Babson College's Tariq Farid Franchise Institute, said while one unit closure of a McDonald's may not seem like it impacts the overall state of the entire company, it does make consumers wonder about the company's overall \"brand health.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, it leaves a lasting impact on the community, as workers who have been there for years are relocated and, as Rodrick mentioned in his letter to his patrons, customers face disruptions to their routines.\n\nMcDonald's California locations make up 9% of its US restaurant portfolio. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the total number of locations that closed in California following April 1.\n\nMcDonald's execs weighed in on California's wage raise briefly during its latest quarterly report.\n\n\"There's certainly labor inflation,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said when asked by an analyst about the company's current inflation expectations. \"Much of that is coming out of what happened in California. ... On a national level, you could probably see we're expecting high-single-digit labor inflation.\"\n\nMcDonald's is not alone in feeling the impact. Other chains like Burger King (QSR), Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK), and In-N-Out are also seeing lower foot traffic in California.\n\nChipotle (CMG), which raised prices by 6% to 7%, saw year-over-year trends underperform its national average in April and May, per Placer.ai.\n\nOn a call with investors, Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said the impact of the higher wages \"will add almost 1 full point to total company pricing beginning in Q2.\"\n\nHe added, \"California restaurant cash flow is below the company average, so this increase will allow us to maintain cash flow. However, it will have a negative impact to overall company restaurant-level margin by about 20 basis points.\" A McDonald's located on Rte. 66 in Azusa, Calif., on Monday, April 1, 2024. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) (Robert Gauthier via Getty Images)\n\nIgram believes the true impact will be felt in the months to come.\n\n\"I would keep my eye on ... what's the traffic impact among brands in California, three months out, six months out, nine months out,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the law's critics are hoping the pressure makes California Governor Gavin Newsom think again.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s bad policies have real-world consequences,\" Tom Manzo, the president and founder of the trade group California Business and Industrial Alliance, told Yahoo Finance. \"People are losing their jobs, businesses are leaving the state \u2014 or in this case, shutting down completely. Lawmakers need to wake up and start supporting our state\u2019s job creators instead of punishing them.\"\n\nThe group claims nearly 10,000 fast food jobs were cut in the state following the introduction of the legislation last fall.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Now at the year\u2019s midpoint, some investors may be inclined to address the month-end\u2019s volatility in the tech scene. They may see it as an opportunity to take some profits off the table of their biggest first-half winner. Specifically, recent unpredictability hitting the semiconductor names may be a cause of concern for some. For others, it\u2019s an alarm bell signaling a pivot to more value-conscious dividends stocks that trade at relatively attractive multiples.\n\nThough only time will tell what to make of late-June tech volatility, I do think dividend stocks are looking quite attractive for investors who worry that the stock market\u2019s valuation may be getting slightly on the expensive side. Remember, a sector-based correction doesn\u2019t need to accompany the end of the bull market. Instead, it seems like more of a pitstop for investors to rebalance to a level that is most comfortable.\n\nLet\u2019s examine three dividend stocks to watch should value shine for summer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nCustomers haven\u2019t been loving McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) prices lately. And though inflation is to blame, it\u2019s clear that the perception of value that made McDonald\u2019s such a standout success is beginning to erode through the eyes of some.\n\nThe good news is McDonald\u2019s has been quick to react accordingly. It has not only won back the business of its most loyal customers. Additionally, it improved its odds of coming out victorious in what\u2019s shaping up to be a summertime \u201cvalue menu war.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the $5 meal deal offers outstanding value. But McDonald\u2019s also looks to be sweetening the pot with a Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) partnership. Therefore, recent lackluster sales could be followed by a summer sales boom as customers take advantage of the deals and new items on tap.\n\nNow down 13% from its high, with a 2.6% dividend yield, MCD stock is a dividend stock that is incredibly intriguing, even timely.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) The logo for T-Mobile is displayed on a sign for an indoor retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t been following the high-performing telecom, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) now pays a dividend. And yes, it\u2019s small in stature (1.47% yield) compared to other dividend stocks. Yet it looks to have the most room to grow as T-Mobile continues outdoing its wireless peers.\n\nAt writing, TMUS stock is flirting with new all-time highs close to $180 per share. Despite the more than 30% pop over the past year, I still view the telecom titan as having more room to sail steadily higher in the second half.\n\nConsiderable wireless momentum and a huge chunk of United States Cellular (NYSE:USM) assets will fall into T-Mobile\u2019s hands in a deal worth $4.4 billion. TMUS stock still has numerous growth drivers to continue its run. Further, the stock still looks modestly priced at 24.2 times trailing P/E, given the resilience of its earnings drivers.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is an investment banking heavyweight that\u2019s been faring incredibly well lately, thanks in part to the recent rise in capital markets activity. With GS stock recently coming off new highs close to $460 per share, the 2.44%-yielder doesn\u2019t look as cheap as it did this time last year. The stock goes for 18.0 times trailing P/E, which seems to be on the high end for the name.\n\nRegardless, GS stock is a dividend play to hold, as the capital markets recovery may still have legs as firms look to get more skin in the AI boom.\n\nWhether we\u2019re talking about firms getting more active on the M&A front to bolster their AI capabilities or AI up-and-comers looking to go public with an IPO, the capital markets are on good footing again. And activity could certainly stay upbeat going into the second half as more firms grab the AI bull by the horns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of McDonald\u2019s.

        "content": "The stocks of some great companies are on sale right now. Well-known businesses and top brands have stocks deep in the red this year despite all three U.S. stock indices trading near all-time highs. With the current rally in equities concentrated in only a few names, many stocks have been left behind.\n\nFor investors, particularly those with long time horizons, the current situation presents a buying opportunity. A lot of great stocks are down substantially right now, trading near 52-week lows and at ultra-cheap valuations. Investors with the courage to take positions in beaten-down names are sure to be rewarded when the share prices recover in the not-too-distant future.\n\nThat is especially true when it comes to value stocks of dependable blue-chip companies. Here are three oversold stocks to buy that deserve your immediate attention.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon Athletica\u2019s (NASDAQ:LULU) stock is down nearly 40% this year and is the worst performer in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Really? The athletic apparel retailer\u2019s shares are down more than Boeing\u2019s (NYSE:BA), and the aircraft manufacturer had a door plug blow off an aircraft mid-flight. Lululemon\u2019s biggest controversy, and the main drag on its share price, is slowing North American sales.\n\nBut even slowing sales in the U.S. weren\u2019t enough to dampen Lululemon\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. The company announced an EPS of $2.54 versus the $2.38 expected among analysts. Revenue of $2.21 billion topped consensus expectations of $2.19 billion. Overall sales rose 10% from a year earlier.\n\nWhile it is true that U.S. sales have slowed, they were still up 3% from a year ago in Q1. And international sales, where the company has concentrated on growing its business, continue to make up for any shortfall stateside. That makes Lululemon an oversold stock to buy.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock has trended lower ever since management said earlier this year that higher menu prices are starting to hurt sales. Consequently, McDonald\u2019s stock is down 12% on the year and getting close to a 52-week low. This should be seen as a buying opportunity by investors, especially as McDonald\u2019s continues to report decent financial results and adjust its menu to the current economic climate.\n\nFor Q1, McDonald\u2019s reported mixed results. EPS of $2.70 slightly missed forecasts of $2.72. But revenue of $6.17 billion topped estimates calling for $6.16 billion. Worldwide sales at McDonald\u2019s increased by 5%, while global same-store sales rose by 1.9%. To attract cash-strapped consumers, McDonald\u2019s is bringing back $5 value meals for a limited time. Starting June 25, the value meals will be available for a month before being discontinued.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe value meals should help to give McDonald\u2019s finances a lift in the near term. And, if they prove popular, they could make a permanent comeback at the Golden Arches.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) An American Airlines (AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), the world\u2019s largest carrier, has also been a laggard this year, having fallen 18% since January. Over the past 12 months, AAL stock has declined 31%. The drop is surprising given that air travel in the U.S. has come all the way back from the pandemic and is currently at record levels. The problem for American Airlines continues to be business travel.\n\nAt the end of May, management at American lowered their sales and profit guidance for the year, citing ongoing weakness in business travel. The carrier has struggled to reignite corporate customers and business travel since the COVID-19 crisis ended. American Airlines also recently announced the departure of Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja, further pressuring the share price.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most international airline, American Airlines has also seen its operations disrupted in the Middle East and parts of Europe due to geopolitical conflicts. While disappointing, AAL stock is currently trading right around its 52-week low and looks like an oversold stock to buy on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently compiled a detailed report on 30 US Cities With the Most Restaurants Per Capita and in this article, we will look at the city with the most restaurants per capita.\n\nOverview of the Food and Drink Sector in the US\n\nAmericans love to eat out, making the restaurant and food industry one of the most prominent sectors in the country. In fact, estimates by the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service show that agriculture, food, and related industries contributed around $1.53 trillion to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country in 2023. This translates to a 5.6% share of the total US GDP. American farms alone made up $203.5 billion of the total amount, which amounts to around 0.7% of the country\u2019s GDP. Agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP is higher than 0.7% primarily because sectors related to the industry depend on agricultural inputs to provide a value addition to the economy. The sectors related to agriculture broadly include food services and eateries, food and beverage manufacturing, food and beverage stores, fishing, and forestry, among several others.\n\nAgriculture, food, and related industries also provided 10.4% of the country\u2019s employment as of 2022, which comes up to around 22.1 million. These industries supported an additional 19.6 million jobs in the country, of which eating and drinking places and food services took up the most significant chunk: around 12.7 million jobs. Food and beverage stores supported approximately 3.3 million jobs as of 2022. You can also look at Top 20 Most Valuable Restaurant Companies in the World for more insight into the restaurant industry.\n\nHow Much Do Americans Spend on Food?\n\nOn average, Americans spend around 12.8% of their household budgets on food, as of 2022. American expenditure on food ranks in the third place of the total living expenses, right after housing and transportation, which take up a 33.3% and 16.8% share, respectively. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that sales in food service went from $632 billion in 2012 to $898 billion in 2022. With the demand for food service increasing continuously, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that employment in the industry will grow by around half a million jobs between 2022 and 2032. In addition, it is projected that the industry will put out 2.6 million job openings every year through 2032, of which none would require more than a high school diploma or equivalent. The National Restaurant Association estimates that the restaurant industry sales will reach $1.2 trillion by 2030, with the workforce in the industry exceeding 17 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nA number of restaurant chains across the United States are opening avenues for employment in the US, such as McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE:MCD), which alone employs more than 100,000 people as of 2023. The world-famous chain opened shop in 1940, and has now grown to become one of the largest restaurant chains by revenue in the world. The company\u2019s Accelerating the Arches campaign has focused attention on expanding its operations to 50,000 restaurants by 2027, kickstarting an era of the fastest growth in the brand\u2019s history. McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) is also aiming to expand its loyalty programs from 150 million 90-day active users to 250 million users by 2027, all the while connecting its restaurants across the globe through Google Cloud technology. These growth plans are set to begin in 2024, and will usher in a new age of enhanced operations and customer experience for the brand, attracting more people and contributing to the growth of the restaurant industry as a whole.\n\nHowever, pressure on the company is increasing due to the ongoing war in the Middle East, with people boycotting the chain after its Aloyana franchise in Israel announced free meals for the Israeli army. Aloyana has been running Israel's McDonald\u2019s restaurants for the past 30 years, with 225 franchises under its wing. On April 5, McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) announced that it would be acquiring all 225 Aloyana-owned McDonald\u2019s restaurants for undisclosed terms and will retain 5,000 employees. McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) has faced decreasing sales in Muslim-majority countries and does not expect an improvement in its business until the war is over. However, the company is focused on its international expansion, and particularly, its expansion in China. The American fast food giant opened up 1,374 new stores in international markets, of which 925 were opened in China. By 2028, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) plans to operate 10,000 outlets in China.

        "content": "In the latest market close, McDonald's (MCD) reached $260.38, with a +0.38% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.67%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.09%.\n\nShares of the world's biggest hamburger chain have appreciated by 0.5% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.85% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.73%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of McDonald's in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $3.10, showcasing a 2.21% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $6.68 billion, showing a 2.85% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.19 per share and revenue of $26.62 billion, which would represent changes of +2.09% and +4.41%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.11% higher within the past month. At present, McDonald's boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, McDonald's is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.28. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that MCD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.92. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Retail - Restaurants was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.74 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 149, putting it in the bottom 41% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "title": "Want $2,000 in Passive Income? Invest $15,000 in These 5 Dividend Stocks and Wait 4 Years",
        "content": "Generating passive income from quality dividend stocks doesn't look as appealing when the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes are hitting new record highs. But the true value of dividend stocks isn't how they perform in the short term relative to the market, but how their consistency can help with financial planning and collecting passive income no matter what the market is doing.\n\nUnited Parcel Service(NYSE: UPS), Chevron(NYSE: CVX), ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM), Target (NYSE: TGT), and McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) are five dividend stocks that have sold off over the last three months. By investing $3,000 into each of these five stocks, you can expect to earn over $2,000 in cumulative dividend income over the next four years. Here's why all five beaten-down dividend stocks are worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis package delivery giant has a long way to go to restore investor confidence\n\nUPS is getting dangerously close to reaching a four-year low. Operating margins have fallen off a cliff as UPS looks to cut costs and set realistic expectations for customer demand after badly overestimating a sustained surge in small package delivery volumes.\n\nUPS has laid out a new plan to restore margins and return to growth by 2026. Healthcare is a key part of this push. But UPS said that it will rely on organic growth and acquisitions to drive the segment -- putting pressure on the company's ability to execute.\n\nUPS is out of favor for good reasons, but it's important to remember it operates in a cyclical industry. With a yield of 4.8% and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.4 , UPS is giving investors a sizable incentive to buy and hold the stock while it turns things around.\n\nBig oil, big capital return programs\n\nIt's been a good run for integrated oil majors like Chevron and ExxonMobil, which have seen their stock prices go from 15-year lows to all-time highs between 2020 and 2023. But both stocks have cooled off lately and are roughly flat over the last year despite a surge in the broader market.\n\nChevron and Exxon are returning a ton of cash to shareholders with buybacks and dividends. They have announced splashy mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the pursuit of boosting cash flow to accelerate growth and their capital return programs.\n\nPerhaps the biggest draw to both companies is their balance sheets. Leading up to the pandemic, Chevron was in a stronger financial position and had less leverage than Exxon. But Exxon has arguably benefited more from strong oil prices in recent years and has paid down a lot of debt. As a result, both companies are in excellent shape right now, sporting very low leverage.\n\nStory continues CVX Net Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBoth companies have strategies to generate high free cash flow and cover the dividend even if oil and gas prices fall to $50 a barrel.\n\nChevron yields 4.3% -- besting ExxonMobil's 3.5%. However, ExxonMobil has a clearer corporate plan for the medium term. Instead of choosing between the two, it could be best to simply buy a 50/50 split of both stocks.\n\nTarget is slowly turning around\n\nEarlier this month, Target raised its dividend for the 53rd consecutive year to a record high $4.48 per share -- representing a forward yield of 3.1%. That puts Target in an elite category of companies known as Dividend Kings -- which includes Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and plenty of other stalwarts that have raised their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nIf you browse the list of Dividend Kings, you'll find many consumer staples, utility, and legacy industrial companies. So it's particularly impressive that Target has been able to pay and raise its dividend for so long, given its discretionary product mix.\n\nTarget has rallied from its late October lows but is only up 6.5% in the last year compared to an over 30% gain for its peer Walmart. Target also sports a forward P/E ratio of 15.2 compared to Walmart's 27.8 and a higher yield than Walmart's 1.2%.\n\nTarget has already worked its inventory down and is boosting margins, but the recovery could accelerate if interest rates are cut and consumer spending improves. Either way, it's a good long-term holding thanks to the quality dividend, valuation, and Target's strong brand.\n\nMcDonald's is addressing the elephant in the room\n\nDown over 15% year to date, McDonald's has been one of the worst-performing Dow Jones Industrial Average components so far this year. Similar to Target, McDonald's hit a wall with price increases and has faced some bad press in response to price comparisons between now and pre-pandemic.\n\nTo its credit, McDonald's has addressed these claims, saying many are exaggerated or flat-out false and that its price increases haven't outpaced the inflation rate. According to McDonald's, its input costs are up 40% over the last five years, so it has also raised prices by 40%.\n\nMcDonald's brand depends on value, convenience, and taste. But value is arguably the most important of them all. McDonald's is hyper-aware of the need to slow/stall price increases and create value options to reel customers back in. In the meantime, the stock has a 21.3 P/E ratio, a 2.7% dividend yield, and 47 consecutive years of dividend increases -- putting it just a few years away from becoming a Dividend King.\n\nIdeal candidates for a passive income portfolio\n\nUPS, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Target, and McDonald's may not be the flashiest companies. But they pay reliable dividends, which can come in clutch when equity prices are falling. This valuable feature is easily forgotten when the major indexes are soaring to new heights. However, long-term investors know that dividends are an excellent way to generate predictable and steady income, which can be reinvested or supplement income in retirement.\n\nAll five companies have strong yields and inexpensive valuations, making them ideal choices for investors looking for bargains without compromising on quality.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and United Parcel Service wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s is hoping to woo back customers with cheap food as it struggles against allegations it has become too expensive.\n\nStarting June 25, the fast-food chain will offer a new $5 meal at most locations nationwide, which includes a McDouble cheeseburger or a McChicken sandwich, small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and small soft drink.\n\n\"We heard our fans loud and clear \u2013 they're looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that's exactly what they'll get,\" said Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, in a statement. \"Value has always been part of our DNA. We're focused on living up to that legacy.\"\n\nThe deal was pre-announced over a month ago.\n\nThe company also touted deals offered by local franchisees which vary store to store. Some McDonald\u2019s in Memphis, Tenn., are offering buy-one-get-one-free breakfast sandwiches and Columbus, Ohio is offering a double cheeseburger and small fries for $3.50. It also reiterated a previously announced promotion where customers can get a free medium fries with a $1 minimum purchase through the end of the year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has been feeling the pinch of inflation and consumer impressions that the chain has become too expensive. Customers have complained about $8 chicken sandwiches and $18 Big Mac meals, coining the phrase \u201cMcFlation\u201d. McDonald\u2019s missed earning expectations for the first time in almost four years in 2023\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nTo counter that, Erlinger took the unusual step last month of issuing a public letter to push back against what he called \u201cviral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald\u2019s has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates.\"\n\n\u201cI can tell you that it frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold - even if it was at one location in the U.S. out of more than 13,700,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMore worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019. The average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019. Despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%).\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\n.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMcDonald's is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.19 points to a change of +2.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.19 indicates a change of +8.2% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MCD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.68 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. The $26.62 billion and $28.21 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.4% and +6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $2.70 for the same period compares with $2.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.01%. The EPS surprise was -0.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, McDonald's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - McDonald's will roll out its $5 meal deal from June 25 for a limited time at some restaurants across the U.S., the burger giant said on Thursday, as fast-food chains ramp up cost-friendly options to boost spending among lower-income groups.\n\nRestaurant Brands International-owned rival, Burger King, is also considering a $5 \"Your Way deal\" as companies turn to improved offers and promotions to counter inflation-hit customers who are increasingly opting to eat at home.\n\nMcDonald's value deal will include a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink for $5.\n\nMcDouble meal options may be priced at $6 at certain restaurants in Alaska, California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, New York (Manhattan only) and Washington.\n\nMcDonald's also brought back app-only \"Free Fries Friday\" that allows customers to snag a free medium fry with any $1 minimum purchase through the end of 2024.\n\nPicky spending hurt performance at McDonald's and KFC parent Yum Brands in the latest reported quarter, whereas promotions fueled sales at Domino's Pizza.\n\nDisposable income among the lower-income groups in the U.S. is declining while menu prices have risen across the food industry over the past year as companies tried to mitigate higher commodity and supply chain costs.\n\nLate May, McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger denounced in an open letter viral reports of runaway Big Mac prices as painting an inaccurate picture of the company.\n\nMeanwhile, the pivot to eating at home has been accelerated by major retailers such as Target, Walmart and Kroger keeping prices on everyday essentials low.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Datadog and Builders FirstSource have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 20, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Datadog DDOG as the Bull of the Day and Builders FirstSource BLDR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on McDonald's Corp. MCD, Wingstop Inc. WING and Brinker International, Inc. EAT.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nDatadog, a data analytics company that makes tools for monitoring infrastructure and application performance, surfaced back on my \"buy radar\" this month after we last took profits on the stock on the big move from $80 to $120.\r\n\r\nHere's what I told my TAZR Trader group on June 11...\r\n\r\nPortfolio is buying Datadog (DDOG).\r\n\r\nI've been eyeing our re-entry here and things have lined up pretty decent...\r\n\r\n1. Back to Zacks #1 Rank after earnings, despite a stock sell-off\r\n\r\n2. Software/Cloud getting killed elsewhere with CRM, MDB, SNOW, and SQ still in penalty box\r\n\r\n3. Chart stabilizing at $110 support\r\n\r\n4. Baillie Gifford still big holders, only selling 3% of shares in Q1\r\n\r\n5. Valuation back to reasonable at 13X sales growing at 21-22% and EPS growing 17%\r\n\r\n6. Goldman noted yesterday on DDOG's \"clear AI vision\" as described here...\r\n\r\nManagement indicated that the hyperscaler growth witnessed in the first quarter \"is attributable to AI value largely accruing at the infrastructure layer as limited GPU capacity comes online for model training (where Datadog has less exposure),\" analyst Kash Rangan wrote.\r\n\r\nThe Goldman analyst observed that management has plans to expand the company beyond model providers \"as more use cases emerge and inferencing workloads grow,\" he added.\r\n\r\nRangan also tried to explain some commentary from Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel about how Gen-AI is expected to increase data quantity and complexity, noting that Pomel believes \"Datadog's core applications (ITIM, APM, Logs) should capitalize on this durable tailwind. Further, with a new category of AI-enabled applications emerging, the CEO noted that new tooling will be required, which Datadog is investing against.\"\r\n\r\nThe Goldman analyst reiterated his $143 PT, which is the Street average, offering 26% upside potential.\r\n\r\nFinding Footing Above $110 After the Quarter\r\n\r\nAfter Datadog's May 8 earnings report, there was some concern about growth leveling off. Here's what the Wedbush analyst team, led by Dan Ives, wrote about the numbers which highlight Net New ARR added that was the highest in almost 2 years...\r\n\r\nOne of the data points that we and investors have been using to estimate DDOG revenues has been its correlation with AWS revenues. For the past few quarters, we have seen AWS Revenues and DDOG Revenues being in sync tracking similar growth trajectories and the \"attach rate\" (DDOG Revenues/ AWS Revenues) follow a predictable path.\r\n\r\nThat math had led us and others to estimate DDOG Revenues in FQ1'24 could be ~$620m+. But that correlation broke down this quarter and DDOG revenues came in lower than those expectations, and in-line with the \"typical\" beat of ~$20m. Even though broadly speaking longer-term growth in Cloud and AWS is a positive for DDOG, the company had been cautioning that AWS revenues and DDOG revenues are unlikely to be in perfect sync every single quarter.\r\n\r\nDespite these concerns, more than a dozen Wall Street analysts raised their EPS estimates for this year, driving the Zacks Consensus up 8.5% from $1.42 to $1.54.\r\n\r\nAnd next year saw a bump from $1.73 to $1.80. These boosts represent nearly 17% annual profit growth for this year and next.\r\n\r\nThe Wedbush team maintained their conservative $155 price target for DDOG. And they sound ready for upside surprises in the coming quarters. So while the stock drifts between $110 and $120, I think data-centric investors are getting good risk/reward on an AI future where hyperscale datacenters are one of the fastest growing segments of industrial real estate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nBuilders FirstSource is an $18 billion enterprise that calls itself \"the nation's largest supplier of structural building products, value-added components and services to the professional market for new residential construction and repair and remodeling.\"\n\nYou could think of it as the \"wholesale\" Home Depot. For comparison's sake, Home Depot is a $350 billion market cap company doing about $155 billion in annual sales.\n\nBut in a strong housing market, BLDR beat all comps, rising out of the bear market lows of late 2022 to post stock performance of over +225% by March of this year.\n\nAnd even after a stock correction of 30% since then, BLDR shares are still up nearly double that of the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB), the two major SFR (single family residential) indexes.\n\nWas the Outperformance Justified?\n\nThe driver of that rally was an EPS trailing twelve-month (TTM) moonshot from $2 to $18 that occurred from 2020 through 2022.\n\nDuring that same period, TTM revenues tripled from $7.5 billion to $23 billion.\n\nThis seems extraordinary, but I think two major forces explain it: one macro and one company-specific.\n\nFirst, the macro supply/demand situation can best be described by data from Lance Lambert who goes by @NewsLambert on Twitter. Here's how he previewed his new research service in October of 2023...\n\nWe are in a historically significant chapter for housing, one that has witnessed affordability deteriorate to levels unseen in decades. That's why I just quit Fortune to launch ResiClub, a news and research outlet that'll track the U.S. housing market.\n\nAnd here's the quick data picture he posted just two days ago...\n\nMay 2021: 0 of the nation's 200 largest housing markets were back to pre-pandemic inventory levels\n\nMay 2023: 7 of 200\n\nMay 2024: 32 of 200 (with 19 in Florida/Texas)\n\n(end of Lambert data view)\n\nSo we hear about the rise in interest rates and housing prices keeping affordability out of reach for many buyers.\n\nAnd we see that many of the \"hotter\" markets are cooling off, with rising inventory levels.\n\nBut the big picture remains one of an overall housing shortage. Still. And those sunbelt markets will continue to attract new migrating homeowners this decade.\n\nWhat \"BFS\" Does Different\n\nWhen I dove into studying this company, I knew very little about them. But when I went to their website, I started getting intrigued their Digital Tools.\n\nAs an NVIDIA (NVDA) shareholder and avid fan of how electronic and system design capabilities have transformed most engineering and manufacturing processes into what I call \"CAD/CAM on steroids,\" I should not have been surprised to see that this key builder supplier has embraced the digital age for its hammer and saw customers.\n\nThen, I felt really in the dark as I started seeing tabs and video links about someone called Matt Risinger, host of the BuildShow. I assumed this was another HGTV \"rehab\" show I never saw (as I watch very little TV).\n\nBut then I played part of an \"episode\" of what appears to be the BFS network with Matt and I was drawn further in. It turns out...\n\nMatt Risinger is a nationally recognized expert in building science and high-performance construction, gaining fame as host of The Build Show on YouTube. Matt regularly works with Builders FirstSource (aka \"BFS\") on all sorts of projects, including building houses with their READY-FRAME\u00ae system, taking advantage of BFS Digital Tools, and even appearing at their live events.\n\nMatt started learning about construction by working summers at an inner-city ministry that fixed up row houses for elderly people. After graduating from college, the national mold crisis in 2002 inspired him to become fluent in Building Science. In 2005, Matt relocated to Austin where he founded Risinger & Company, and has since become a leader in the industry.\n\nWhen I watched episode 5, I learned how fanatic Matt is about preventing mold -- and how BFS helps him design materials and construction strategies to do so. Their flatbed delivery of precisely labeled pre-cut lumber and custom materials is amazing -- and important since they admit that many home-building crews will have new, inexperienced members who benefit greatly from on-site \"wood prints\" for how the puzzle gets nailed together.\n\nTo see the episode #5 that I watched, use this link. Here's how they describe it...\n\nMatt's team begins framing the house in this episode, and he showcases how BFS's READY-FRAME\u00ae system streamlines framing with pre-cut, labeled lumber packages. He also demonstrates how our myBLDR.com digital homebuilding platform uses 3D modeling to identify and solve MEP clashes before construction even begins. See how these innovations save time, reduce waste, and lead to a smoother building process!\n\nSo Why Is BLDR a Zack #5 Rank?\n\nOn May 7, BLDR delivered another \"top and bottom beats\" quarter, but the growth slowdown was confirmed after a meteoric ramp.\n\nThe company came out with quarterly earnings of $2.65 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.42 per share. But this comps to earnings of $2.96 per share a year ago.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of only 9.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this construction supply company would post earnings of $2.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.55, delivering a surprise of 31.48%.\n\nIt appears that the slowdown in BLDR growth, and rising home inventories, has propelled Wall Street analysts to take down EPS estimates.\n\nMind you, the downward revisions to growth are hardly a blip, like 1%. But both the top and bottom lines look \"flatish\" for this year and next.\n\nSo the real \"adjustment\" is about how far the stock ran into this growth as it levels off.\n\nI would expect BLDR to continue to be a winner of the digital home-builder revolution and we should look to buy shares on dips into $120-140. The Zacks Rank will give us a heads up about the earnings turnaround.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) Aided by Loyalty Program, Comps\n\nMcDonald's Corp.benefits from the robust loyalty program, menu innovation, expansion efforts and global comps growth. McDonald's expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth in the long term.\n\nDespite the aforementioned factors, the company's shares have lost 13.7% in the past year, compared with the industry's decline of 7.2%. Inflationary pressures and macroeconomic woes are the reasons behind the decline. Let's delve deeper.\n\nGrowth Drivers\n\nEver since the launch of the loyalty program in the United States, the company has been able to transform its offerings across drive-thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in. The program has not only helped in retaining the existing customers but also in expanding the customer base. MCD has already introduced a loyalty program in more than 50 markets, including the United States, Germany, Canada, the U.K., Australia and France.\n\nIn the first-quarter 2024 earnings call, the company stated its notable improvements in digital penetration across markets thanks to increased loyalty sales and record mobile app orders, leading to greater frequency and increased spending by loyal customers. It also stated the success of McDonald's World-Famous Fries feature at the center of a digital campaign in Australia. The alignment of seamless digital experience with campaigning resulted in incremental customer acquisition and increased the market's loyalty sales.\n\nAlso, the U.K. market showcased loyalty results with the return of the Winning Sips digital experience, encouraging customers to add a drink to their order with a chance to win on every cup.\n\nTo boost its loyalty program participants and encourage customers to avail the digital platform, McDonald's is expecting to deploy \"Ready on Arrival,\" which is a digital enhancement initiative in the United States. This initiative will focus on enabling the crew to begin assembling a customer's mobile order before their arrival at the restaurant and is expected to be launched across the top six markets by 2025 end.\n\nMcDonald's believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding the company's presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance. In the first quarter of 2024, the company opened 6,000th restaurant in China, on track to fulfill its global expansion plan.\n\nMCD is planning to open more than 2,100 new restaurants globally in 2024, including 500 openings in the United States and IOM segment and 1,600 (including nearly 1000 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market. The new unit growth aim for 2024 showcases about 4% contribution to new unit growth (net of closures). Also, the company expects net restaurant unit expansion to contribute nearly 2% to 2024 systemwide sales growth. It targets to open 50,000 restaurants by 2027.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In the first quarter of 2024, global comps increased 1.9% compared with a rise of 12.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. In the quarter, the company's comparable sales grew more than 30%, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth, compared with the past four years.\n\nThe uptrend was backed by average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases, successful restaurant-level execution, effective marketing campaigns featuring the core menu and continued digital and delivery growth. Also, the effective implementation of the Accelerating the Arches strategy added to the uptick.\n\nConcerns\n\nThe persisting inflationary pressures are likely to hurt the company's margins. In the first quarter of 2024, margins suffered due to continued pressure from elevated commodities and wages. In the first quarter, McDonald's company-operated restaurant expenses were $2.04 billion, up 6% from $1.92 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates, remains headwinds.\n\nGiven the ongoing inflationary headwinds, MCD expects the operating margin to remain pressurized in the near term. The company expects commodity and food and paper inflation to be at the higher end in 2024. Also, it expects labor inflation to be in the high single digits.\n\nKey Picks\n\nWingstop Inc.sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "title": "Dip Before the Rip: 3 Stocks Set to Rebound 25% or Higher in 2024",
        "content": "Investors are perpetually on the hunt for stocks to buy on the dip. This strategy involves buying companies that have experienced a recent decline in their share price but remain fundamentally sound.\n\nBuying the dip can be a lucrative move, especially in volatile markets where corrections provide enormous opportunities. In 2024, there are several candidates worth taking a closer look at. These companies can potentially provide investors with significant returns as they recover from temporary setbacks. Moreover, an improving economy, lower inflation and increased risk appetite are all positive backdrops for a rebound. With unique value propositions, strong earnings growth and robust business models, they all possess the potential to recover by at least 25% or more.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the top tech stocks to buy on the dip in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) has revolutionized the travel industry with its innovative business model connecting travelers with hosts offering unique travel experiences. Despite facing setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has delivered incredible growth over the last few years.\n\nOne of the key factors driving Airbnb\u2019s potential for a substantial rebound is the resurgence of travel demand. The sector has remained extremely resilient, and pent-up demand will continue to drive growth for both leisure and business travel. Additionally, a stronger economy coupled with easing interest rates in the back half of 2024 is another positive sign for the company. After reporting record revenue, earnings and free cash flow in the 2023 fiscal year, growth has continued to accelerate. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 18% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.1 billion. Net earnings skyrocketed 126% YOY to $264 million while generating nearly $2 billion in free cash flow from operations. With strong travel demand as a buffer, ABNB stock remains one of the best stocks to buy on the dip in 2024.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is another standout candidate for investors seeking lucrative tech stocks to buy on the dip. Known for its suite of creative software products, Adobe has been a leader in creative cloud, digital media and marketing solutions.\n\nAdobe stock has faced pressure in 2024 thus far, with the stock significantly underperforming other major technology companies. The stock is currently down 10% year-to-date (YTD), after posting weak earnings and guidance in the first quarter of 2024. It also faces an antitrust probe from the FTC. The company was sued for failing to disclose certain fees to subscribers and making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions. Despite the recent dip in its stock price due to company-specific challenges, Adobe\u2019s fundamentals remain strong. In Q2 FY24, Adobe delivered record revenue of $5.31 billion. Net earnings rose 21% YOY to $1.57 billion, driven by strong growth across Creative Cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, its generative AI copilot software, Adobe Sensei, aims to accelerate design and productivity for its customers. These factors enable the company to return value to shareholders and drive growth in the second half of 2024.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), a global fast food giant, is another excellent stock to consider buying on the dip. Despite facing challenges in 2024, the company is embracing the digital age and working to expand its footprint globally.\n\nOne of the core strengths of McDonald\u2019s is its brand recognition and extensive global footprint. The company has a strong presence in 118 countries and territories, serving millions of customers daily. It has been up against a tough macroeconomic environment in 2024 but has remained extremely resilient.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has been proactive in modernizing its operations, including the expansion of its loyalty rewards program. Its comparable sales have also marked its 13th consecutive quarter of growth in Q1 FY24. That is an extremely impressive feat, but the stock has not responded favorably. Moreover, its valuation looks extremely attractive, with the stock trading at just 20 times its forward earnings. Despite these positive developments, MCD stock continues its slide down 14% YTD. If you\u2019re looking for promising stocks to buy on the dip, McDonald\u2019s should certainly be one of the first places to look.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 72%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in McDonald's implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about McDonald's.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in McDonald's. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. With 7.0% and 4.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of McDonald's\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$383m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in McDonald's. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - McDonald's has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "McDonald\u2019s $5 Value Meal Intensifies a Fast Food Price War",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s US chief says the company is ready for a fight.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCar Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Hedge Fund Talent Schools Are Looking for the Perfect Trader Putin\u2019s Hybrid War Opens a Second Front on NATO\u2019s Eastern Border Nvidia\u2019s 591,078% Rally to Most Valuable Stock Came in Waves\n\nAnd in order to win, the burger chain is pulling out one of the most potent weapons in its arsenal: The value meal. It\u2019s all part of a bid to lure back penny-pinching customers who have cut back on fast food after flocking to the Golden Arches in recent years.\n\nOn June 25, McDonald\u2019s will kick off a marketing blitz and a new $5 meal deal, raising the stakes of what\u2019s shaping up to be an all-out battle among US restaurants desperate to lure back inflation-battered diners.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to winning the value war,\u201d Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s US, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nLast month, after Bloomberg News reported on McDonald\u2019s plans for the $5 promotion, competitors hit back with their own deals \u2014 and insults.\n\nBurger King\u2019s US president pledged to roll out its $5 value meal \u201cbefore they do,\u201d alluding to McDonald\u2019s in a memo to franchisees. Wendy\u2019s Co. pushed out a $3 breakfast offer and took to social media to mock its competitors for copying its ideas. Even Starbucks, known for its pricey Frappuccinos and lattes, said it would offer a $6 breakfast sandwich and coffee combo.\n\nWhen asked about his adversaries\u2019 fighting words, Erlinger smiled and said he isn\u2019t fixated on the competition.\n\nAs the largest restaurant chain in the US by sales, he said McDonald\u2019s size and marketing muscle gives the $130 billion company an edge over smaller rivals and the ability to reduce any hit to franchisee profits. \u201cThink about our scale,\u201d he said, noting that the incremental cost of adding fries and a drink to a sandwich was minimal. The $5 deal includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink.\n\nFranchisees, who operate the majority of McDonald\u2019s stores, don\u2019t all agree with that calculus. Many say they are eager for a value meal that brings customers in the door but have concerns about people trading down from pricier options, like the $9 Big Mac combo.\n\n\u201cThere simply is not enough profit to discount 30% for this model to be sustainable,\u201d an independent franchisee group said in a message last month to its roughly 1,000 members.\n\nThe company said a local $5 promotion in upstate New York has performed well with lower-income consumers while driving additional sales by wealthier customers who buy more than just the $5 meal deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor McDonald\u2019s though, the promotion \u2014 which runs four weeks nationally and longer in markets like Dallas and Las Vegas \u2014 is not just about driving sales. The national campaign is also geared toward dispelling the notion that McDonald\u2019s has become too expensive after images of an $18 Big Mac combo meal in Connecticut went viral on social media along with claims that prices have doubled in recent years.\n\nThe company\u2019s prices have increased by an average 40% since 2019 to offset rising costs, Erlinger said in a May blog post. He said the $18 price tag is an anomaly found at just one of the company\u2019s more than 13,700 locations.\n\nThat\u2019s cold comfort to customers like Dylan Covington, 33, who lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and used to eat at McDonald\u2019s about once a week. Price hikes have prompted him to cull his McDonald\u2019s visits to every two or three months. Instead, he said he heads to a local restaurant where he can get a bigger sandwich for about the same price.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s was always the cheap option,\u201d Covington said. \u201cNow it\u2019s not even that. I don\u2019t see a reason to go there unless I\u2019m craving a Big Mac specifically.\u201d\n\nConsumer Pullback\n\nAs prices rose around the US, local McDonald\u2019s deals just weren\u2019t doing enough to lure back customers like Covington. While the economy is still humming along and the unemployment rate remains low, real disposable income growth in the US has stalled. Americans have depleted much of their pandemic savings and debt is starting to pile up. Dining out has decreased and, for many, even fast-food restaurants are increasingly reserved for a special treat.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s competitors were early to ramp up their value offers, with Arby\u2019s offering a $6 meal deal back in January and White Castle pushing a $5 Bacon Bundle in April. McDonald\u2019s sales were initially holding up better than competitors and the company took a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they were caught on their back heels in terms of value,\u201d said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bank of America.\n\nErlinger said customers are becoming even \u201cmore discerning about where they\u2019re spending their dollars.\u201d So the company decided to pitch a bigger national deal to franchisees, who own and operate 95% of US locations and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns. The operators initially rejected the promotion over profit concerns but eventually came around, encouraged in part by additional funds provided by Coca-Cola Co.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is also dangling additional promotions like free fries in front of customers ordering via the fast-food chain\u2019s app, a key part of the company\u2019s growth strategy. App users order more often and are more likely to add drinks, desserts and other extras that boost check sizes and drive up sales.\n\nThe $5 meal promotion likely won't provide an instant fix. The company\u2019s original dollar menu debuted in 2002, revamping it several times before landing on a $1 to $3 lineup in 2018. Although the value menu eventually drove strong results, the initiative took a while to gain traction, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski told investors in April about the 2018 value menu.\n\nPrice Perception\n\nMcDonald\u2019s declined to detail promotional plans beyond this summer, although Erlinger he said it was fair to say the promotion isn\u2019t the fast-food chain\u2019s last word on value. \u201cWe obviously are going to remain competitive around value and affordability beyond the $5 meal deal.\u201d Right now, customers aren\u2019t looking for new products or creative takes on McDonald\u2019s nuggets, burgers or wraps. \u201cThey\u2019re asking for value and affordability,\u201d he said.\n\nFor their part, competitors say they\u2019re ready to go to battle with the restaurant industry\u2019s heavyweight. Patrick Doyle, chairman of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc., said the increased focus on value could help prop up the entire industry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that maybe prices had gotten a little too high,\u201d Doyle told investors in mid-June. The value talk is \u201chopefully going to help the perceptions around the category in general \u2014 get some people open their minds to coming back.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "title": "McDonald's Ditches AI Drive-Thru Voice Technology. What Could This Mean for SoundHound AI Stock?",
        "content": "McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) recently announced that it was ditching its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered voice ordering technology powered by International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM). Instead, the fast food giant will look to replace the technology with an alternative solution by the end of the year.\n\nLet's look closer at McDonald's decision and what impact it could have on SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), whose voice-powered AI technology has been making a lot of inroads in the restaurant space lately.\n\nA potential McDonald's replacement\n\nMcDonald's decision to end its partnership with IBM for automated order-taking technology after a two-year trial comes as a surprise, as the restaurant chain sold IBM the technology powering the solution back in the fall of 2021. McDonald's originally purchased an AI voice start-up called Apprente in 2019 and integrated it into a venture called McD Tech Labs, which it later sold to IBM. Since that deal, it has been testing the technology, which it has deployed at more than 100 locations.\n\nThe voice-ordering technology will be shut off at all locations by July 26 of this year. When the technology was first rolled out, McDonald's said it was about 85% accurate and that it could take 80% of orders. However, with social media, some of the tech's larger screw-ups became viral, such as it adding ketchup packets and butter to a sundae and water order.\n\nMcDonald's chief restaurant officer Mason Smoot told franchisees the company was happy with the trial but that there was \"an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoundHound is a potential logical choice as a replacement for IBM, as the company has gained a lot of traction in the restaurant space with its AI-powered drive-thru voice ordering technology and other industry-specific applications. These include its Smart Ordering platform, which takes orders and answers questions from inbound phone calls, as well as its Employee Assist solution, which acts as a copilot across an employee's headset to help answer questions they may have, such as how to clean the ice cream machine.\n\nSoundHound has struck deals with a number of large quick-service restaurant (QSR) chains, including White Castle, Jersey Mike's, Five Guys, Noodles & Company, and Chipotle Mexican Grill, along with top restaurant fintech companies such as Toast, Olo, and Square. As such, it is certainly a viable contender to replace IBM as McDonald's new voice AI-powered ordering technology partner.\n\nHowever, SoundHound is not the only candidate. Wendy's is using Alphabet's Google Cloud to power its Fresh AI platform that it is testing at some of its drive-thrus. Meanwhile, QSRs such as Del Taco, owned by Jack in the Box, Rally's, Checker's and CKE have used solutions from companies such as Presto Automation, Hi Auto tech, OpenCity, and Valyant AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Alphabet could be the favorite to win the deal, as McDonald's and Google Cloud struck an agreement last December to apply generative AI solutions across its restaurants worldwide. However, even with the Wendy's deal, voice AI is still not Google's core competency, and if SoundHound has the better solution, it could still win the McDonald's deal.\n\nTime to buy SoundHound stock?\n\nGiven McDonald's recent deal with Google Cloud, SoundHound likely isn't considered the favorite to win the deal, but if it does, it would help validate the company as the leader in the voice AI space, and the stock would certainly pop on the news. The fact that McDonald's isn't rushing into a new deal right away and looking to explore alternatives is thus good news, and SoundHound will likely get a chance to show off its technology to the fast-food giant.\n\nTrading at an over 20 times forward price to sales (P/S) multiple, shares of SoundHound are not cheap. However, the company has been growing its revenue rapidly, and it has built up a large backlog of business. Meanwhile, a McDonald's super-sized catalyst could be down the road. SOUN PS Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOpportunities like McDonald's and the inroads it's making into other industries and devices outside its core automobile and restaurant verticals can help the stock move from here. While SoundHound has a lot of potential, it still remains a speculative investment, given its valuation and the fact that it is still in the early innings of its growth phase. As such, any investments in this growth tech stock should be sized accordingly, given the risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Starbucks Stock (NASDAQ:SBUX): Why Howard Schultz Is Likely Wrong",
        "content": "Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), the world\u2019s largest coffee shop chain, has struggled recently amid woes in China and weak same-store sales in the U.S. This prompted former CEO Howard Shultz to call for a \u201cmaniacal\u00a0focus on the customer experience\u201d and to say he doesn\u2019t like the Starbucks app. I\u2019ll explain why I think Howard Schultz\u2019s approach is likely wrong and why I remain bullish on Starbucks despite its negative shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\nWhy Howard Schultz Is Likely Wrong\n\nFormer CEO Howard Schultz recently did an interview with Acquired. In the interview, he said that he wasn\u2019t a big technology guy and that he built the company on humanity, the customer experience, free advertising, great coffee, a unique cup, and brand power. I think Howard did everything right, and the company\u2019s low employee turnover and friendly staff show that the culture he built is still intact.\n\nNonetheless, Howard then spoke out against the Starbucks app, saying he doesn\u2019t like how it has ruined the connection between the customer and the Barista. He said that Starbucks needs to bring back the human connection that it was built on. This was met by resistance from the show\u2019s hosts, who said they probably wouldn\u2019t go to Starbucks if not for the app.\n\nI think the Starbucks app is one of Starbucks\u2019 key competitive advantages against regular coffee shops. The app seems to be attracting young customers, and the technology costs can be spread out over the company\u2019s thousands of locations. In addition, the app is instrumental in the customer loyalty program and data collection. Single-location coffee shops simply cannot afford to compete with Starbucks on its technology.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 other advantages are its drive-throughs, its tens of thousands of combinations of drinks (some sources say over 100,000), and its brand power. If you think about it, single-location coffee chains can easily beat Starbucks on customer connection. But single-location coffee shops cannot beat Starbucks on convenience, selection, technology, and brand. Also, chains like McDonald\u2019s can offer drive-through coffee, but they just can\u2019t match the quality, brand, and selection of Starbucks. There\u2019s a reason Starbucks coffee is priced at a premium.\n\nIn summary, while the barista-to-customer connection was instrumental in building Starbucks, I think Howard Schultz is now missing what separates Starbucks from single-location specialty coffee shops: its technology (app), drive-throughs, selection, and brand.\n\nIs Starbucks\u2019 Negative Shareholders\u2019 Equity A Problem?\n\nAs we can see on Starbucks\u2019 balance sheet below, the firm has a pretty deeply negative shareholders\u2019 equity, with its liabilities exceeding its assets. While this would be a problem in most industries, it\u2019s not a big issue for Starbucks. The company has had negative equity for many years. In this regard, the company is similar to McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD).\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, why is this not an issue? Well, first off, Starbucks\u2019 assets are understated on its balance sheet. Real estate assets such as buildings are often carried on the balance sheet at historical cost (the cost at which they were purchased). Then, they are depreciated over time. Starbucks has maintained these assets pretty well, and the U.S. money supply has grown tremendously. This means that these assets are likely worth way more than their purchase price, not less. Thus, their balance sheet value is likely understated.\n\nSecond, the Starbucks brand carries tremendous value. If Starbucks were to sell its brand, it would command a massive sum of money because it is world-renowned and gives the company pricing power. This, too, is not carried on Starbucks\u2019 balance sheet at its true value.\n\nSo, if Starbucks were to carry its brand and its real estate on its balance sheet at fair market value, its shareholder\u2019s equity would likely be positive and fairly robust. Now, is the company carrying too much debt and capital lease liabilities? Maybe a little. But if we look at its interest coverage ratio, the company\u2019s operating income covers its net interest expense by more than 12x, which is excellent.\n\nThe Valuation\n\nAlso, the value of Starbucks is not its balance sheet; rather, it\u2019s the firm\u2019s future cash generation. To eliminate the effects of growth CapEx on free cash flow, I instead prefer to look at Starbucks\u2019 P/E ratio, which sits at 22x. This gives investors a starting earnings yield of 4.5%, which is attractive for a company with Starbucks\u2019 growth prospects and predictability.\n\nChina Will be Fine\n\nLuckin Coffee (OTC:LKNCY) has been expanding rapidly in China, and there seems to be some price war dynamics going on. This is typical behavior for Chinese companies, which often try a little too hard to gain market share, sometimes at the expense of profitability. I think Starbucks has taken the right approach in refusing to engage in price wars.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 CEO said the following in the Q2-2024 call: \u201cI think the growth that\u2019s taking place in the mass area of the China business, of the China overall coffee and tea segment, is one where we see just intense price competition. We\u2019re choosing not to participate in that. We are a premium brand.\u201d\n\nIt may be prudent for Starbucks to slow its store openings in China in the meantime, but overall, I think the Chinese consumer has a lot of cash to spend (Chinese savings rates are extraordinarily high). In light of this, I\u2019m looking for ways to get exposure to China without taking on undue geopolitical/ownership structure risk. Starbucks may be one of those avenues.\n\nIs SBUX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nCurrently, eight out of 26 analysts covering SBUX give it a Buy rating, 18 rate it a Hold, and zero rate it a Sell, resulting in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average SBUX stock price target is $88.78, implying upside potential of 10.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $75 per share to a high of $112 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SBUX Stock\n\nAs the largest coffee chain in the world, Starbucks\u2019 competitive advantage no longer comes from its customer relationships but from its technology, data, brand, drive-throughs, and selection. These advantages cannot be matched by coffee chains and family-owned shops alike. Therefore, I believe Howard Schultz was wrong to denounce the company\u2019s app.\n\nThere are many reasons to be bullish on Starbucks. Between its plethora of competitive advantages, its invaluable brand and real estate (which is understated on its balance sheet), and its rebound potential in an extremely cashed-up Chinese economy, I\u2019m bullish on SBUX at a P/E ratio of 22x.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Sell in June Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "There are many dividend stocks that make for great long-term investments, but conversely, there are many dividend stocks to sell before they wreak havoc on your portfolio.\n\nThe prospect of steady, cash-based returns is one of the main areas of appeal with dividend stocks, particularly high-yield dividend stocks. However, these payouts can be outweighed by the poor performance of the underlying stock.\n\nPoor fiscal performance and/or insurmountable headwinds can lead to price declines for shares, which even when coupled with the payouts, can result in lackluster or worse, negative, returns. Not only that, keep in mind that dividend payouts are not set in stone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThey can be subject to change. Low-quality high-yield dividend stocks are typically at greater risk of dividend reductions or suspensions. The announcement of a dividend cut or suspension can lead to tremendous price declines. With these risks in mind, it\u2019s clear why you should exit any positions in the following seven dividend stocks to sell.\n\nB&G Foods (BGS)\n\nSource: Growers Express\n\nB&G Foods (NYSE:BGS) makes and sells a variety of branded baking and food products. Famous brands in its portfolio include Cream of Wheat, Crisco, Green Giant and Ortega. Among investors, BGS may be best known for its high dividend.\n\nAt current prices, BGS stock has a forward dividend yield of 9.05%. However, B&G Foods has a history of dividend cuts. In late 2022, the company slashed its quarterly payout by 60.4%, from 48 cents to 19 cents per share. If that\u2019s not bad enough, this stock has also experienced a sharp price decline, even after the announcement of this dividend reduction. During this time frame, BGS has fallen by around 40%, from $14 to around $8.40 per share.\n\nHigh debt and inflationary pressures keep weighing on B&G\u2019s fiscal performance. With a payout ratio of around 84.5%, even the current dividend rate may not be sustainable. Although plans to sell its frozen vegetable business could help reduce debt and provide capital for new acquisitions, helping to secure the dividend, err on the side of caution. Sell BGS, before another dividend cut or dismal quarterly earnings release sinks it further.\n\nCato (CATO) Cato storefront and logo\n\nSource: Nolichuckyjake / Shutterstock.com\n\nRight off the bat, you can tell that plenty of investors have already declared that Cato (NYSE:CATO) is one of the dividend stocks to sell. Shares in the specialty apparel retailer currently sports a forward dividend yield of 12.45%. Make no mistake, this isn\u2019t a bargain opportunity among dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nRather, it\u2019s a sign that a dividend cut for CATO stock is likely forthcoming. As Seeking Alpha commentator Caffital Research argued earlier this month, the company is currently funding its dividend from cash on its balance sheet, not from cash flow. While Cato did report positive earnings last quarter, if results fail to improve further, and its cash position runs low, Cato will likely cut or suspend this rich payout.\n\nAlthough CATO trades at a 46.5% discount to its tangible book value, don\u2019t view this as a margin of safety. In the event that the company decides to cut or suspend its high payout, investors could exit positions in droves, leading to a tremendous price decline. Put simply, steer clear of this value trap. Sell existing positions, and make sure not to enter a new one.\n\nNextEra Energy Partners (NEP) Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns renewable electricity generation assets. Given recent clean energy and energy usage trends, one may think that NEP is a high-yield stock with growth potential.\n\nUnfortunately, much suggests this is not the case. Although true that NEP stock currently makes large distributions to its unitholders, NextEra doesn\u2019t necessarily have strong growth prospects. As I recently argued, when discussing utility stocks to sell, I pointed out how analysts and investors have become increasingly concerned about whether NEP stands to benefit from the current industry tailwinds.\n\nEven worse, there are growing concerns about the sustainability of NEP\u2019s 12.77% distribution yield as well. Like with the other dividend stocks to avoid discussed above and below, as investors are largely in this stock for the yield. Any reduction of this yield will undoubtedly lead to big losses. Whether you\u2019ve held NEP for some time, or bought in after its massive plunge last October, ahead of the next big potential plunge, head for the exits.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) shares have cratered in price since the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. A variety of factors, including a worsening of its fiscal performance, a dividend cut, and its removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average have knocked this pharmacy stock down to multi-decade lows. Nevertheless, I wouldn\u2019t jump to the conclusion that things can only get better from here.\n\nAlthough a Walgreens turnaround is in motion, it may take years for the company to regain its financial health. Moreover, it\u2019s not a lock that WBA stock will hold steady, allowing contrarian investors to collect its 6.43% dividend while they wait for the comeback. While reduced, WBA\u2019s dividend still represents around 47.9% of the company\u2019s annual earnings. This may be cutting it thin, given Walgreens\u2019 need to reduce debt and finance its restructuring.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s renewed expectation that Walgreen is going to sell its U.K.-based Boots division, enabling it to bolster dividend sustainability. However, if this latest effort to sell Boots fails like the first attempt in 2022, concerns about a dividend cut could return. At risk of another sell-off, WBA remains one of the dividend stocks to sell.\n\nWendy\u2019s (WEN) A photo of a Wendy's chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.\n\nSource: Deutschlandreform / Shutterstock.com\n\nWendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) doesn\u2019t have the \u201cdividend aristocrat\u201d respectability of its larger rival McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), but it does beat out shares in the \u201cGolden Arches\u201d when it comes to yield.\n\nWEN stock is a high-yielder, with a forward dividend yield of 6%. MCD stock has a forward dividend yield of only 2.63%. However, even as MCD has been struggling lately, calling into question any argument that poor price performance makes it a better burger stock to buy, it\u2019s not as if WEN has been a stellar performer during this same time frame. Just like with Mickey D\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s is also facing growth challenges, as rising prices have turned customers away from fast food.\n\nWith a \u201cfast food fight\u201d on price emerging, investors are now concerned that even as sales stabilize, lower margins and profitability are now on the menu. As WEN\u2019s payout ratio now stands at a staggering 101%, barring a rapid rebound in profitability, a dividend cut may be imminent. Even if the payout rate stays as-is, stagnation could still lead to more share price declines. While cheaper than MCD, at 16.7 times forward earnings, other struggling restaurant stocks trade at far lower valuations.\n\nWhirlpool (WHR) The Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate building. Whirlpool layoffs.\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhirlpool (NYSE:WHR) is another situation among high-yield dividend stocks where it\u2019s still questionable whether the dust has truly settled. Yes, after several years of declining revenue and profitability, sell-side forecasts call for the appliance maker\u2019s earnings to start bouncing back after this year.\n\nHowever, this bull case may hinge too highly on a sudden rebound in the U.S. residential real estate market. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Larry Ramer recently discussed, Wall Street remains very bearish on WHR stock, due to the continued challenges in the housing market. The Federal Reserve\u2019s continued \u201chigher for longer\u201d stance on interest rates calls into question whether improved demand for housing, and hence, household capital goods like appliances, is just around the corner.\n\nIf Whirlpool\u2019s profitability challenges continue, watch out. Even if Whirlpool\u2019s 7.71% dividend is sustainable, further earnings weakness could lead to further price declines that outweigh this rich payout. There has been speculation lately about Whirlpool being a takeover target, but until this starts to move beyond the rumor stage, consider it best to keep playing it safe. Stick to stronger dividend value plays, and steer clear of WHR.\n\nXerox Holdings (XRX) A photo of the Xerox logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.com\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve called Xerox Holdings (NASDAQ:XRX) one of the dividend stocks to sell. Last November, I cited the prospect of continued price declines, and the questionability of its turnaround plans, as factors that made it a \u201cdoomed dividend stock.\u201d\n\nFlash forward to now. XRX stock has surged and sank, yet remains near where it was when I last laid out the bear case. Still, shares still give off serious \u201cdividend trap\u201d vibes. While another serious price decline still hasn\u2019t taken shape, don\u2019t rule it out. XRX\u2019s payout ratio currently stands at nearly 72%. To a greater extent than before, Xerox may not be able to sustain its 25 cent per share quarterly dividend.\n\nAgain, like with other \u201cdividend traps,\u201d chances are the announcement of a dividend cut would likely lead to a severe reversal in price for XRX. Even before the company possibly decides to trim its dividend, concerns about a cut could re-emerge. Per InvestorPlace Earnings, XRX missed on earnings last quarter. If that happens again, when Xerox releases Q2 results next month, this may elicit a strongly negative response from the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald's is ending its test run of AI-powered drive-thrus with IBM",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Ever get your McDonald's order mixed up at an AI-powered drive-thru? The experiment behind the fast food giant's current automated order taker will soon be coming to a close.\n\nMcDonald's confirmed late Monday that it decided to end a global partnership with IBM, which has been testing this artificial intelligence technology at select McDonald's drive-thrus since late 2021.\n\nThat doesn't mean you'll never encounter some sort of chatbot while picking up fries on your car ride home again. While the IBM partnership for McDonald's current automated order taker test is winding down, the Chicago-based company suggested that it wasn't ruling other any other potential AI drive-thru plans down the road \u2014 pointing to \u201can opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur work with IBM has given us the confidence that a voice ordering solution for drive-thru will be part of our restaurants\u2019 future,\u201d McDonald's said in a prepared statement this week \u2014 adding that it would continue evaluations to \u201cmake an informed decision on a future voice ordering solution by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nNumerous fast food chains have begun exploring the implementation of AI across operations over recent years, with many pointing to possibilities of maximizing speed and cutting costs.\n\nIn the U.S., Wendy\u2019s partnered with Google Cloud to develop \u201cWendy\u2019s FreshAI\" chatbot. White Castle teamed up with SoundHound AI with a goal of bringing voice-powered AI technology to more than 100 restaurants by the end of 2024. And a handful of Panera, Arby's and Popeyes locations have brought OpenCity's \u201cTori\u201d voice assistant to their order lanes.\n\nBeyond America, Popeyes U.K. also launched its first AI-powered drive-thru (dubbed \u201cAl\u201d) last month, after the company said a pilot program reported 97% accuracy.\n\nSuccess for AI-powered drive-thrus has been mixed. McDonald's automated order taker with IBM received scores of complaints in recent years, for example \u2014 with many customers taking to social media to document the chatbot misunderstanding their orders.\n\nUnnamed sources familiar with the technology told CNBC that the technology has had difficulty interpreting different accents and dialects, among other challenges affecting order accuracy.\n\nMcDonald's declined to comment about the automated order taker's accuracy. In an initial statement, IBM said that \u201cthis technology is proven to have some of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate in some of the most demanding conditions,\" but did not immediately respond to a request for further comment about specifics of potential challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Armonk, New York-based tech company also said that it is currently \u201cin discussions and pilots\u201d with several other quick-serve restaurant clients interested in the automated order taker.\n\nAccording to trade publication Restaurant Business and CNBC, which obtained a memo sent to franchisees last week, the automated order technology will be shut off in McDonald's locations testing it \u201cno later than July 26, 2024.\u201d\n\nBoth IBM and McDonald\u2019s maintained that, while their AI drive-thru partnership was ending, the two would continue their relationship on other projects. McDonalds said that it still plans to use many of IBM\u2019s products across its global system.\n\nIn December, McDonald's launched a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud. In addition to moving restaurant computations from servers into the cloud, the partnership is also set to apply generative AI \u201cacross a number of key business priorities\u201d in restaurants around the world.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "McDonald's Corporation MCD benefits from the robust loyalty program, menu innovation, expansion efforts and global comps growth. McDonald\u2019s expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth in the long term.\r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned factors, the company\u2019s shares have lost 13.7% in the past year, compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 7.2%. Inflationary pressures and macroeconomic woes are the reasons behind the decline. Let\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nGrowth Drivers\n\nEver since the launch of the loyalty program in the United States, the company has been able to transform its offerings across drive-thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in. The program has not only helped in retaining the existing customers but also in expanding the customer base. MCD has already introduced a loyalty program in more than 50 markets, including the United States, Germany, Canada, the U.K., Australia and France.\r\n\r\nIn the first-quarter 2024 earnings call, the company stated its notable improvements in digital penetration across\u00a0 markets thanks to increased loyalty sales and record mobile app orders, leading to greater frequency and increased spending by loyal customers. It also stated the success of McDonald's World-Famous Fries feature at the center of a digital campaign in Australia. The alignment of seamless digital experience with campaigning resulted in incremental customer acquisition and increased the market's loyalty sales.\n\nAlso, the U.K. market showcased loyalty results with the return of the Winning Sips digital experience, encouraging customers to add a drink to their order with a chance to win on every cup.\r\n\r\nTo boost its loyalty program participants and encourage customers to avail the digital platform, McDonald's is expecting to deploy \u201cReady on Arrival,\u201d which is a digital enhancement initiative in the United States. This initiative will focus on enabling the crew to begin assembling a customer\u2019s mobile order before their arrival at the restaurant and is expected to be launched across the top six markets by 2025 end.\r\n\r\nMcDonald\u2019s believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding the company\u2019s presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance. In the first quarter of 2024, the company opened 6,000th restaurant in China, on track to fulfill its global expansion plan.\n\nMCD is planning to open more than 2,100 new restaurants globally in 2024, including 500 openings in the United States and IOM segment and 1,600 (including nearly 1000 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market. The new unit growth aim for 2024 showcases about 4% contribution to new unit growth (net of closures). Also, the company expects net restaurant unit expansion to contribute nearly 2% to 2024 systemwide sales growth. It targets to open 50,000 restaurants by 2027.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In the first quarter of 2024, global comps increased 1.9% compared with a rise of 12.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. In the quarter, the company\u2019s comparable sales grew more than 30%, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth, compared with the past four years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe uptrend was backed by average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases, successful restaurant-level execution, effective marketing campaigns featuring the core menu and continued digital and delivery growth. Also, the effective implementation of the Accelerating the Arches strategy added to the uptick. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerns\n\nThe persisting inflationary pressures are likely to hurt the company\u2019s margins. In the first quarter of 2024, margins suffered due to continued pressure from elevated commodities and wages. In the first quarter, McDonald\u2019s company-operated restaurant expenses were $2.04 billion, up 6% from $1.92 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates, remains headwinds. Given the ongoing inflationary headwinds, MCD expects the operating margin to remain pressurized in the near term. The company expects commodity and food and paper inflation to be at the higher end in 2024. Also, it expects labor inflation to be in the high single digits.\n\nKey Picks\n\nWingstop Inc.

        "title": "McDonald\u2019s CFO and CMO on working together in one of the world\u2019s most famous C-suites",
        "content": "Good morning. When chief financial officers and chief marketing officers collaborate well, it can boost top-line growth.\n\nThis was the topic of a conversation I just had with McDonald\u2019s global CFO Ian Borden and global CMO Morgan Flatley. We chatted after their panel session at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity on Monday morning.\n\n\"We used to think of marketing as a bit of a black box, or nebulous part of our business where it didn't really have good visibility, and didn't have good transparency,\" Borden said. In 2019, McDonald\u2019s eliminated its global CMO role but reinstated it less than a year later, Fortune previously reported.\n\nToday, McDonald's (no. 162 on the Fortune 500) \"spends a lot of money on marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's, frankly, one of the most important growth investments we make.\u201d It\u2019s key to driving strong top-line growth, he added.\n\nFlatley joined McDonald\u2019s in 2017 as U.S. chief marketing and digital customer experience officer. In 2021, she was promoted to global chief marketing officer and became head of new business ventures in 2023. It's been under her leadership, Borden said, that marketing has really excelled.\n\nBorden, global CFO since 2022, has spent more than 25 years at McDonald\u2019s, leading markets and functions globally. His take on the evolving role of the CFO: You can't just be a pure, finance-focused CFO anymore.\n\n\u201cCertainly in my own career, the fact that I've run a market, worked and lived around the world, and I've run our entire international business, just the range of experiences I have, I think that's what helps you understand the breadth of the business,\" he said.\n\nBorden continued: \u201cWhen you're working together like Morgan and I do, in this relationship, you have a much deeper understanding of what your executive partners are trying to do, and what you can do to help support them.\u201d\n\nCFOs \u201calways get a little nervous\u201d when they can't see the work behind the output, he said. \"My advice to CMOs is to engage with your CFOs and finance leaders,\" Borden said. Be transparent with data and metrics, he said.\n\nAs a CMO, Flatley explained, \u201cYou have to be a total business leader. I have to be able to talk about multiple areas of the business in order to be effective and respected in my job.\u201d\n\nShe also pointed to the value of technology. \u201cWhen I came into the marketing world a long time ago, there were a handful of channels that connected with consumers, and today there are hundreds of thousands,\u201d she said. \u201dI've had to become a real student of technology and the digital landscape because that is how we're building relationships with consumers in the future.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFlatley added that it's a \u201cCMO\u2019s dream\u201d to hear your CFO talk about the power of creativity and the importance of risk-taking. \u201cI obviously feel very lucky to be in an environment where that's recognized and supported,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more on how marketing is a vital engine to McDonald\u2019s success, including the firm's key metrics, you can read the complete article here.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While the value of chief marketing officers is being questioned at many Fortune 500 companies, and as CMOs\u2019 waning influence could pose a setback for female executives, the CFO and CMO at one of the world\u2019s most recognized brands are working together toward common goals.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Ian Borden, EVP and global CFO, and Morgan Flatley, EVP,\u00a0global CMO and new business ventures, chatted about a variety of topics with Fortune following their panel session at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity on Monday morning. And one of those topics happened to be their partnership at the company that ranks no. 162 on the Fortune 500, generating total revenue last year of $25.49 billion.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot of money on marketing,\u201d Borden said. \u201cIt's, frankly, one of the most important growth investments we make.\u201d It\u2019s key to driving strong top-line growth, he said. Years ago, \"we used to think of marketing as a bit of a black box, or nebulous part of our business where it didn't really have good visibility, and didn't have good transparency.\" In 2019, McDonald\u2019s eliminated its global CMO role but reinstated it less than a year later, Fortune previously reported.\n\nFlatley joined McDonald\u2019s in 2017 as U.S. chief marketing and digital customer experience officer. In 2021, she was promoted to global chief marketing officer, and also became head of new business ventures in 2023.\n\nIt\u2019s under Flatley\u2019s leadership that McDonald\u2019s marketing team and agency partners created a companywide concept called \u201cfan truths,\u201d a universal language about the moments, memories, rituals, and behaviors of McDonald's consumers based on data. The transparency has build trust in marketing among McDonald\u2019s business leaders, Borden said.\n\nA key metric\n\nBesides creativity, another accelerant for business is what the company calls its \"known customer base\"\u2014digitally learning more about patrons and their preferences. McDonald's connects with its customers is through personalized and digital offers, like those available on the mobile app.\n\nMarketing and finance share the customer lifetime value metric to gauge growth with customers, Flatley said. \u201cIt is a really important metric for us today, and over the next few years,\u201d she added. McDonald\u2019s has a goal to grow its loyalty programs from 150 million active users to 250 million by 2027, and increase sales attributable to these users to $45 billion.\n\nAnd that growth has been aided by savvy marketing. Borden pointed to a September 2020 promotion that offered the Travis Scott limited-time meal, based on the musician's favorite childhood order. In its earnings report released Oct. 8 of that year, comparable sales at U.S. restaurants rose by 4.6% compared with the same three-month period a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd in June 2023, the company launched a Grimace Birthday Meal featuring a limited-edition purple shake, Borden said. Comparable quarterly sales at U.S. McDonald's locations increased 10.3%.\n\n\u201cI think you could clearly link those great creative ideas to factual fan truths,\u201d Borden said, \u201cand clearly link those ideas to incredibly strong business results.\u201d\n\nTaking risks\n\nBorden, global CFO since 2022, has spent more than 25 years at McDonald\u2019s, leading markets and functions globally, and it's been a combination of these experiences that led him to view marketing as more than just a cost center. Nonetheless, finance chiefs do tend to be risk averse.\n\n\u201cOf course, when I hear the word 'risk,' my hand always shakes a little bit,\u201d he quipped. Regarding marketing, \"we take risks on the execution,\" he said. \"You don't want to take risks on the strategy, or on the consumer insight, or the fan truth,\" he added.\n\nIt\u2019s in the creative execution of promotions where you want to challenge your team and agencies. Being a bit uncomfortable \u201cunlocks the best creative output,\u201d Borden said, adding that instead of asking yourself \"Will it work?\" you instead should consider \"Is it true?\" \u201cAnd if it's not true, then we're going to go back and make sure we've got the right fan truth.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jollibee has a cult-like following in the Philippines and among the Filipino diaspora. But can its \u2018Chickenjoy\u2019 and sweet spaghetti ever truly challenge McDonalds globally?",
        "content": "There may be no busier place in Hong Kong on a Sunday than the Jollibee restaurant on Connaught Road. Nestled between skyscrapers in the city\u2019s Central District, the Filipino fast-food outpost is packed. At lunchtime, there\u2019s no place to sit. Customers are waiting to pounce on a free chair as soon as one opens up.\n\nSunday is a day off for the city\u2019s domestic helpers\u2014most of whom are Filipino. Dozens of them are crowded in the basement of this outlet to socialize with friends and post on social media. The room is so loud you have to shout to be heard. The gathering spot also offers them a taste of home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the chicken,\u201d says Mary, a Filipino domestic helper who\u2019s worked in the city for a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s crunchy and juicy.\u201d She also loves Jollibee\u2019s spaghetti, a pasta dish featuring ground beef and hot dog slices slathered in a signature sweet red sauce. \u201cTaste is all that matters.\u201d\n\nJollibee is an icon in its home country and among the Filipino diaspora. Founded in 1978, Jollibee won over diners in the Philippines by serving hamburgers and fried chicken\u2014its \u201cChickenjoy\u201d makes up 30% of all orders\u2014as well as dishes with more local flavor like its spaghetti.\n\nWhat started as a single restaurant in Quezon City, outside Manila, is now a global operation called Jollibee Foods Corp. (JFC) that has over 6,800 locations and earned $4.4\u00a0billion in revenue in the 2023 fiscal year, landing it at No. 86 on Fortune\u2019s inaugural Southeast Asia\u00a0500 list. Chicken Joy lovers flock to the Grand Opening of the Jollibee fast food restaurant in Times Square in New York on Thursday, August 18, 2022 . The restaurant chain, which has been dubbed the Philippine McDonald's because of its ubiquity and popularity in the country, opened its Times Square store. Jollibee Foods Corp., has 65 stores in the US with this being the fourth in New York. (Photo by Richard B. Levine)No Use Germany.\n\nJFC has grown by serving its core customers\u2014Filipinos\u2014the world over. Its flagship Jollibee brand has 1,240 restaurants in the Philippines and another 420 in other countries. JFC has also expanded by acquiring brands in Southeast Asia, the U.S., and China whose outlets serve pizza, Cantonese dim sum, Filipino barbecue, Taiwanese bubble tea\u2014essentially a globally diversified portfolio of comfort foods.\n\nThe buying spree is part of CEO Ernesto Tanmantiong\u2019s mission to make JFC one of the world\u2019s top five restaurant companies by market cap. \u201cThat\u2019s the North Star,\u201d he says. \u201cWe said we had to be the No.\u00a01 Asian food company in Asia. And then when we were again about to achieve that, we set our vision to the world arena.\u201d\n\nJFC has a long way to go. Despite Jollibee\u2019s fervent following, the parent company is about a fifth the size of McDonald\u2019s by revenue, and experts are skeptical that it will ever come close to catching up.\n\nBut Tanmantiong, a company lifer, is convinced that the thing that\u2019s won over Filipino customers\u2014the taste of Jollibee\u2019s food\u2014will appeal to non-Filipinos the world over; they just need a chance to try it.\n\nStory continues\n\nJollibee is such a staple in the Philippines that it has become an obligatory stop for visiting dignitaries. When New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Luxon went to the Philippines in April, he ate at a Jollibee in Manila\u2019s business district on his first day. Philippines President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. said that Luxon\u2019s visit made him an \u201chonorary Filipino.\u201d Marcos posted his own Jollibee order to Facebook a week later: hamburgers, fried chicken, and \u201cpalabok,\u201d a Filipino noodle dish.\n\nAt another Manila Jollibee in May, CEO Tanmantiong braves the heat\u2014officials warned of a heat index over 113\u00b0 F\u2014for a photo shoot with a bucket of Chickenjoy and the chain\u2019s mascot: a chubby, friendly bumblebee.\n\nTanmantiong doesn\u2019t carry himself like the CEO of one of the Philippines\u2019 largest companies. He arrives wearing a red Jollibee-branded polo shirt styled closely to the uniform worn by his employees. He grins as he talks about Jollibee\u2019s 40-year-plus history. You can tell he\u2019s told these tales many times\u2014and he\u2019s excited to tell them again.\n\nTanmantiong\u2014or \u201cSir Ato\u201d to his employees\u2014has worked at Jollibee since its founding. (It\u2019s Filipino tradition to refer to all customers as \u201csir\u201d or \u201cmadam.\u201d) Jollibee grew out of two ice-cream parlors Tanmantiong\u2019s older brother, Tony Tan Caktiong, opened in 1975 in Cubao, Metro Manila. Tanmantiong, then a college student, helped out with odd jobs.\n\nThere were \u201cice-cream parlors starting all over Manila,\u201d Tanmantiong recalls, so Tan Caktiong differentiated his menu by adding hot dishes like hamburgers. Customers preferred the new fare, so Tan Caktiong pivoted, settling on the name \u201cJollibee\u201d\u2014a combination of \u201cjolly\u201d and the industrious \u201cbee.\u201d Tanmantiong became manager of Jollibee\u2019s smallest outlet. Jollibee CEO Ernesto Tanmantiong photographed at a Jollibee restaurant in Manila, Philippines, on May 2, 2024. Geric Cruz for Fortune\n\nFour years later, Jollibee faced an existential threat when McDonald\u2019s entered the market. \u201cWe were told that in any country that McDonald\u2019s entered, they swallowed their competitors,\u201d Tanmantiong remembers.\n\nManagement ordered a SWOT analysis of both companies. McDonald\u2019s beat Jollibee in all but one category: taste. \u201cTheir products are bland, while Asians prefer flavored food,\u201d he says. It took McDonald\u2019s a decade to localize its menu, giving Jollibee a meaningful head start.\n\nPerhaps unintentionally, Jollibee also took inspiration from its bee mascot, swarming its competition. \u201cIf McDonald\u2019s opened one big store, we surrounded them with six small stores,\u201d Tanmantiong says. He notes that Jollibee\u2019s smaller, more efficient stores surpassed its Western rival on sales per square meter.\n\nThe strategy worked. Today, Jollibee controls about 50% of the Philippines\u2019 chicken-and-burger market, to McDonald\u2019s 29%.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough for JFC to be No.\u00a01 in hamburgers and fried chicken. \u201cWhen we were about to achieve that, we raised the bar,\u201d Tanmantiong said.\n\nAndrew Delios, a professor at the National University of Singapore\u2019s business school, explains that it\u2019s common for a large Filipino company to funnel local earnings into an \u201cacquisition spree.\u201d A dominant company like JFC can get only \u201cmarginal gains\u201d from increasing market share, he says, meaning it \u201cmust grow by acquisition.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what JFC did starting in 1994 when it acquired Greenwich Pizza, a local chain. JFC bought other Filipino brands in the coming years: Chinese-food chain Chowking in 2000, cake bakery Red Ribbon in 2005, and Mang Inasal, serving Filipino-style barbecue, in 2010.\n\nTanmantiong climbed the ranks as Jollibee expanded, becoming CEO in 2014. Tan Caktiong is JFC\u2019s chairman, looks after its M&A strategy, and serves as \u201cCTO,\u201d Tanmantiong says: \u201cchief taste officer.\u201d\n\nJFC\u2019s spending spree cemented its dominance in its home market. Combined, its brands represent over half of the Philippines\u2019 quick-service restaurant sector, with individual brands often cornering up to 90% of the market for a given cuisine. Timeline shoes the history of Jollibee\n\nJollibee also followed the Filipino diaspora to overseas markets. It opened its first international outlet in Taiwan in 1986 and its first U.S. outlet in Daly City, Calif.\u2014a San Francisco suburb with a large Filipino American community\u2014in 1998. But Tanmantiong admits to a lot of early missteps in Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Middle East.\n\nIn 2018, JFC renewed its push to take Jollibee global, opening branches in prime locations like downtown Los Angeles, New York City\u2019s Times Square, and Earls Court in London.\n\nJollibee\u2019s overseas clientele are still mostly Filipino, but word of mouth and good chicken are winning over others. In 2022, the digital publication Eater crowned the brand the \u201cbest fast-food fried chicken in America,\u201d an honor Jollibee outlets in the Philippines proudly advertise. Tanmantiong claims that half of Jollibee\u2019s U.S. customers are non-Filipino. In some markets, like Vietnam, its customers are entirely local.\n\nJFC set a second big goal in March: to triple its profits to $450\u00a0million by 2028. Tanmantiong plans to achieve that feat with \u201cstrategic acquisition\u201d and \u201caggressive expansion.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say that we want to have superior products, but in reality it\u2019s difficult to develop,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s already available out there, why not just acquire it?\u201d\n\nJFC has already bought up brands around the world, including Hong Kong\u2019s Michelin-rated dim sum chain Tim Ho Wan, California-based caf\u00e9 chain The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, and Denver-based fast-casual burger joint Smashburger.\n\nFor all its overseas deals, JFC\u2019s heart is still in the Philippines. It generated 62% of revenue and 97% of operating profits in its home market in 2023.\n\nDelios calls JFC\u2019s new profit target \u201can unlikely proposition,\u201d citing the difficulty of adapting to demanding international markets. Global fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s have decades of experience, which lets them scale at speed. \u201c[KFC owner] Yum Brands is opening a new franchise every two hours,\u201d he says. JFC is also focusing its growth on the U.S. and mainland China, where competition is fierce. There\u2019s \u201croom to grow\u201d in these crowded markets, Delios says, but JFC will need \u201ca credible offering \u2026 beyond the Filipino diaspora,\u201d and can\u2019t just rely on what worked in its home market.\n\nJFC is also struggling with inflation. The Philippines reported a headline inflation rate of 6% in 2023. A weak Philippine peso makes Jollibee\u2019s imports more expensive. Tanmantiong says inflation is the worst he\u2019s ever seen, but claims JFC has only passed about half of price hikes onto consumers.\n\nBut Jollibee\u2019s existing base of die-hard fans are good brand ambassadors, even if the chicken\u2019s getting a bit more expensive. \u201cWhen you\u2019re about to board an 18-hour flight back to the States, nothing hits like Chickenjoy at Manila airport,\u201d says Dale Talde, a Filipino American celebrity chef. \u201cThat\u2019s a core memory for me.\u201d\n\nThis article appears in the\u00a0June/July 2024 Asia issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cFilipino fried chicken takes flight.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s is taking a step back from artificial intelligence\u2014at the drive-thru, at least.\n\nThe fast-food giant has ended its two-year partnership with IBM, which saw it testing AI to take people\u2019s voice orders at drive-thru kiosks. The company has been testing the AI at over 100 restaurants, but now plans to remove the systems by the end of next month.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been successes to date, we feel there is an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly,\u201d said Mason Smoot, chief restaurant officer for McDonald\u2019s USA, in an email obtained by trade publication\u00a0Restaurant Business.\n\nIntroducing AI into the order-taking process was meant to speed up the overall turnaround time for customers. It\u2019s unclear if that goal was achieved, but the email from Smooth did note that the company planned to make \u201can informed decision on a future voice-ordering solution by the end of the year\u201d and said the company was optimistic about the practice, despite some public missteps.\n\nTikTok is laden with videos of confused customers getting items they never asked for, ranging from nine sweet teas to two pats of butter. \u201cCream packet? No! I just want a large water and a cup of ice cream. Not a ketchup packet! Oh, my God,\u201d one customer exclaims to the bot in one video\u2014which can be heard asking questions in the background.\n\nIBM is also working with chains including Wendy\u2019s, Hardee\u2019s, and Dunkin' on using AI to take drive-thru orders.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has had a long-standing interest in AI. In 2019, it bought AI firm Apprente with the goal of speeding up order-taking. That same year it bought Dynamic Yield, which specializes in personalization and decision logic technology, and took a 10% stake in Plexure, the vendor for the McDonald's app. McDonald's has a new internal team called McD Tech Labs, and the company has said it plans to expand its presence in Silicon Valley, hiring additional engineers, data scientists, and tech experts.\n\nDynamic Yield's tech, for instance, promotes different menu items based on time of day or weather, boosting customer spending.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that there are not many restaurant stocks to buy currently available. Consumers are reigning in their spending and reducing the amount they spend. It took a while for the U.S. Federal Reserve to catch up to the trends. However, interest rate increases and ongoing inflationary problems have finally started to bring an end to excess consumer discretionary spending.\n\nEven the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain, McDonalds (NYSE:MCD), is feeling the squeeze. Starting later this month, it plans on offering a $5 meal deal to bring back customers. But, as the promotion is only a month long, it remains to be seen if that will change the tide of its currently mixed financial results.\n\nThis all leaves investors wondering what the best restaurant stocks to buy right now are. There certainly are good buys out there, but it will depend greatly on how each restaurant company will navigate the near future while also planning for the long-term. Taking that into account, here are three of the best restaurant stocks to buy in June 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSweetgreen (SG) indoor vertical farming set up with green plants on shelves and PVC irrigation tubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YEINISM\n\nSweetgreen (NYSE:SG) is a fast casual salad restaurant chain founded in the Washington, D.C. area in 2007. It went public in November 2021, right around the time the stock market as a whole took a major dip. So it\u2019s not surprising that in the first six months of being publicly traded it lost almost 83% of its value.\n\nBut the company is up a staggering 205% year-to-date (YTD), thanks in part to it beating all major expectations for its first quarter results. Sweetgreen opened six new restaurants during the first quarter. And, same-store sales increased 5%, 2% higher than management expected. Revenue totaled $158 million, which was better than management\u2019s expectation of $154 million at best.\n\nSweetgreen is growing in popularity and plans to open up to 28 new stores in 2024, including nine automated restaurants. The company has also been very strategic as it opens new locations. It prefers to place them in areas with a large population, in high employment areas and in high income areas. As a relatively new name in the restaurant industry, there is plenty of opportunity for growth. SG appears to be one of the great restaurant stocks to buy right now.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) seems to be weathering a recent controversy mostly unharmed. The CEO, Brian Niccol, has been lambasted online for his tone deaf response to customers\u2019 complaints about portion sizes. However, CMG stock is up 41% on the year, and has remained relatively flat in the days since his video blunder went viral.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of this month, Chipotle is set to complete a 50-for-1 stock split in order to make its shares more affordable. This split will be one of the largest ever for the New York Stock Exchange and presents great potential for investors who can buy in now. However, it also implies good future upside for investors who need to wait until it becomes more affordable. With this development, CMG might be at the top of the list of best restaurant stocks to buy this month.\n\nOther recent positive financial developments for the company in Q1 include total revenue increasing by 14.1% to $2.7 billion. Additionally, comparable restaurant sales increased\u00a0 7% and diluted earnings per share came in at $13.01, a 23.9% year-over-year increase.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWashington D.C. area restaurant founders must be on to something, because Cava (NYSE:CAVA) is another one of the top restaurant stocks to buy right now. Relatively new to the stock market having only gone public in June of 2023, Cava is up 137% since its IPO and 121% YTD.\n\nWhat some would consider the Mediterranean version of Chipotle, Cava offers bowls, salads and pita wraps. It targets a similar demographic as Sweetgreen and Chipotle, so it\u2019s no surprise it is also doing well in the current economy. While traffic has slowed, the company still recently reported great Q1 results. EPS came in at 12 cents, a dramatic improvement from a loss of $1.30 per share the year prior, and beating analysts\u2019 estimates of 5 cents. Revenue was up 30.3% to $256.3 million and beat Wall Street forecasts of $246 million.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Cava now expects to open 50 to 54 net new restaurants in 2024, up from its February outlook of 48 to 52 net openings. With that increase has come the expectation that same-restaurant sales and adjusted EBITDA will also be higher than previously estimated. As consumers look for more affordable options, restaurants like Cava that offer filling meals for reasonable prices should see significant growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

Huh / Associated Press)\n\nMillions of American families are hitting the road to start summer vacation, and ordering food on the run tends to be par for the course. It couldn\u2019t come at a better time. Fast food joints are in the midst of a budget-meal war, offering promotions to lure customers back to their restaurants despite inflation woes and a minimum-wage increase in California and other states.\n\nStarting June 25, McDonald\u2019s will offer a month-long deal featuring a combo meal \u2014either a McChicken, a McDouble or four-piece chicken nuggets, small fries and a small drink \u2014 for $5.\n\nAfter McDonald's announcement last month, other fast food restaurants followed suit. Wendy\u2019s announced its $3 limited-time breakfast combo meal and Burger King trumpeted that it planned to bring back its $5 Your Way Meal.\n\nIn addition, fast food mobile apps continue to offer deep discounts.\n\nApp relief\n\nEarlier this week, a Big Mac with medium fries and medium drink cost $11.79 before tax at a McDonald\u2019s in Santa Ana. That same meal ordered via a mobile app for pickup at the same location cost $6.50 before tax, a savings of $5.29.\n\nBut the prices and deals tend to vary depending on the user.\n\nRead more:The fast-food industry claims the California minimum wage law is costing jobs. Its numbers are fake\n\nDiners have taken to complaining on Reddit about the McDonald\u2019s mobile app. Some say the deals decrease with use. Others say their friends or partners were getting a better deal on the app than they were getting. A few mentioned that they could find better deals by just walking in and ordering at their local McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe plethora of promotional deals come after diners blasted fast food companies on social media earlier this year for rising prices.\n\nIn response, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, said in an open letter last month that the average price of McDonald\u2019s menu items is up an estimated 40% since 2019. The McDonald's restaurant logo and golden arch is lit up in Chicago. McDonald's plans to introduce a $5 meal deal in the U.S. in June 2024 to counter slowing sales and customers' frustration with high prices. (Jeff Roberson / Associated Press)\n\n\u201cRecently, we have seen viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald\u2019s has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates. This is inaccurate,\u201d Erlinger wrote.\n\n\u201cThe average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%),\u201d as unsubstantiated claims allege on social media.\n\nQuick-service restaurants said the increases were in response to rising inflation and labor costs \u2014 partly due to hikes in minimum wage not just in California but throughout the country.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more:Your guide to California's new $20-an-hour minimum wage for fast food workers\n\nIt\u2019s true that quick-service restaurants such as McDonalds have had to contend with increased costs, but they are by no means hurting, said Shubhranshu Singh, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in quick-service marketing.\n\n\u201cThey are not struggling,\u201d Singh said. \"Inflation is going up. Wage rates are going up. But profit for McDonald\u2019s is also going up.\u201d\n\nGlobal comparable sales for McDonald's grew nearly 2% in the first quarter of the year, according to the latest statistics made available by the company. The fast-food giant described this profit increase as having \"benefited from average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases.\"\n\nPrice-weary diners have taken notice and become fed up with the price hikes, choosing to eat less fast food and protesting on social media that their go-to budget meals were no longer wallet-friendly, Singh said.\n\nSeveral diners took aim at McDonald\u2019s, griping on TikTok about the company charging more for food that\u2019s supposed to be affordable.\n\n\u201cThis is $3 worth of food,\u201d said a customer who held up a hash brown. \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t seem right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cMcDonald's has gotten too cocky,\u201d said another customer. \u201cY'all not supposed to be expensive.\u201d\n\nOne diner called it \"absurd\" that she\u2019d paid $4.59 for a medium order of french fries.\n\nAnd then there was the uproar over a McDonald\u2019s location in Connecticut charging $18 for a Big Mac combo meal. The photo sparked a nationwide debate on soaring fast-food prices.\n\nMaking choices\n\nMost McDonald\u2019s in the United States are independently franchised, so prices vary depending on where one visits.\n\nIncreased fast food prices ultimately led to slower-than-expected sales at various quick-service restaurants, such as McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and Pizza Hut.\n\n\u201cConsumers are always making choices,\u201d said restaurant analyst Sara Senatore at Bank of America. \u201cWhen the value proposition starts to diminish, consumers will make other choices.\u201d\n\nUp until fairly recently, consumers were willing to pay more for quick-service food. When fast food prices started to soar in 2022, consumers just went along because prices everywhere had surged due to inflation, Senatore said.\n\nBut now inflation has lessened. Grocery prices have fallen and budget-conscious consumers may no longer see fast food as the clear-cut affordable choice, she said.\n\nEnter the value meals.

The approved increase went into effect on April 1 and was considered a victory for organized labor. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBudget meals aren\u2019t new. In the 1980s, McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s and Burger King engaged in a series of advertising campaigns known as the Burger Wars competing for customers in the then-flourishing fast food market.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that the consumer will go there and maybe buy something additional to the value meal and then want to return even when there is no deal,\u201d Singh said.\n\nBut the promotions, analysts warned, can\u2019t last forever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Singh said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect any of these deals to stay.\u201d\n\nSign up for our Tasting Notes newsletter for restaurant reviews, Los Angeles food-related news and more.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) is having a moment. The company's stock has been red-hot this year, gaining about 70% since last November. And now, investors are looking forward to its upcoming 50-to-1 stock split. When markets open on June 26, shareholders will own 50 times as many shares as they did at the close of trading on June 25, but the price of each one will be about one-fiftieth of what it was before. The stock split won't change the value of people's investments or the valuation of the company -- at least, not in and of itself.\n\nIt will, however, make the shares somewhat more accessible to smaller retail investors, including Chipotle's employees. Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer Jack Hartung said the move would help the company \"reward our team members and empower them to have ownership in our company.\" And as shares become more accessible, demand for them could increase, which could add to the momentum behind the stock.\n\nRegardless of the direct and indirect impacts of a split, the question remains: Is Chipotle a good investment at its current valuation?\n\nImpressive growth\n\nGrowing revenues consistently, especially at double-digit percentage rates, is one of the surest ways to get Wall Street to love a company. Chipotle has been doing just that at a time when many of its competitors are struggling. Take a look at this table, which shows Chipotle's top-line growth for the last five years compared to McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) and Yum! Brands(NYSE: YUM), the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and The Habit Burger Grill.\n\nCompany 2019 Revenue Growth 2020 Revenue Growth 2021 Revenue Growth 2022 Revenue Growth 2023 Revenue Growth Chipotle 14.8% 7.1% 26.1% 14.4% 14.3% McDonald's (0.5%) (10.1%) 20.9% (0.2%) 10% Yum! Brands (1.6%) 1% 16.5% 3.9% 3.4%\n\nData sources: Company filings.\n\nThe only year Chipotle didn't post double-digit percentage growth was 2020. (I think we might know why.) Still, despite pandemic lockdowns, it achieved growth of more than 7% during a year when McDonald's revenue shrank by more than 10%.\n\nThe story is similar for net income. Chipotle has more than doubled its earnings since 2021, well outpacing its peers. MCD Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nWhile top-line growth is important to investors, though, it's not everything.\n\nChipotle's valuation should give you pause\n\nChipotle currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.7. That's pretty high for the restaurant industry. McDonald's and Yum! both trade at ratios just above 20.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors are often willing to pay a premium for a stock based on the expectation of earnings growth.\n\nTo weigh that, they look to its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which you get by dividing the company's P/E by its expected growth rate over a given period. This provides a better idea of a company's value relative to its forecast future earnings. In this case, lower (but not negative) is better, and a stock with a PEG ratio below 1 is generally viewed as being undervalued.\n\nChipotle's PEG ratio is 2.5, which is in line with McDonald's 2.9 and Yum! Brands' 2.2. So on a forward-looking basis, maybe it's not as overvalued as it might appear to be.\n\nYet one weakness of the PEG ratio is its reliance on earnings growth forecasts -- there's no guarantee those predictions will prove accurate. If, for example, the economy turns and consumers pull back on their discretionary spending, restaurant sales will dip. Although in that circumstance, all three of these companies would likely suffer, a dip in sales could hit Chipotle's stock harder because it would expose its current overvaluation. Why buy a stock trading at a premium if there isn't an expectation that future earnings will justify it?\n\nIt's also worth considering that Chipotle's revenues have been boosted by the company's aggressive expansion. It opened 271 new locations last year alone. However, comparable-store sales -- which don't factor in the impact of adding more stores -- grew by just 7.9%. That rate was lower than McDonald's 9% comps growth.\n\nDespite TikTok pushback, Chipotle still seems to be on track\n\nCurrently, Chipotle is catching some heat from social media users who've been accusing it of reducing its portion sizes to maximize profits. In response, some customers have been using their smartphones to record the store workers preparing their burritos and bowls in an attempt to either prove the assertion or to induce the employees to be more generous with their scoops.\n\nThe company, meanwhile, has stated categorically, \"There have been no changes in our portion sizes,\" and added that management has \"reinforced proper portioning with our employees.\"\n\nWhether portion sizes have actually changed may be less relevant than consumer perception -- and consumer response. The kerfuffle hasn't seemed to impact the chain's numbers yet, but if it continues, it could. Chipotle built its brand, in part, on burritos that were bursting at the seams.\n\nRegardless of these concerns, Chipotle still seems to be doing a whole lot right. Given the growth it is delivering quarter after quarter and year after year, I'm inclined to look past its high valuation, but I'd also recommend exercising caution. Keep an eye on the TikTok protests, the company's response to them, and whether or not the issue has a material impact on revenues in the coming quarters. But outside of that concern, Chipotle continues to look like a good bet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Instead of Buying the Dip on Boeing, Consider These 3 Dow Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "So far this year, Boeing (NYSE: BA) has been the second worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (behind only Intel). But just because a stock is down doesn't automatically make it a good value.\n\nHere's why 3M (NYSE: MMM), McDonald's(NYSE: MCD), and Chevron(NYSE: CVX) are three better Dow dividend stocks to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3M is on the road to recovery\n\nLee Samaha(3M): It's interesting to compare Boeing with 3M. Both industrial giants have seen better days, and both entered 2024 with questions about their strategic direction. But here's the difference: Boeing has continued to disappoint investors, and there are serious questions about the viability of its plan to hit $10 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2025/2026.\n\nOn the other hand, 3M's management is slowly rebuilding some confidence in investors and derisking the company. Furthermore, the new CEO, William Brown, has an opportunity to outline his vision for the company. As such, Boeing could be set to lower medium-term expectations, while 3M's prospects could get brighter.\n\nIn 2024, 3M has spun off its healthcare business, Solventum, and raised cash in the process. Agreements were made to resolve legal issues and clarify the value of payouts. Moreover, the dividend cut will free up cash resources to restructure the business.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing restructuring program appears to be improving margin performance, and there are signs of improvement in some of its key end markets like semiconductors and electronics.\n\nThe stage is set for Brown to lay out a plan to generate value for investors by implementing his strategic vision for the company. While there's still a lot of work for Brown to fully convince investors that 3M is on a sound track, the analyst price target of $115 seems reasonable, and with a 2.8% dividend yield, 3M could deliver double-digit returns for investors from here.\n\nRestoring value\n\nDaniel Foelber (McDonald's): After briefly surpassing $300 per share earlier this year, McDonald's stock has fallen a surprising amount for a stodgy blue chip dividend stock. It's now down over 12% in 2024 -- making it one of the top five worst-performing components in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMcDonald's is a somewhat challenging business to analyze, since the vast majority of its stores are franchised rather than company-owned. The franchise-heavy model means that McDonald's depends on its brand and the confidence that potential franchisees can make money, and therefore, should take on the risk of opening a new McDonald's location. It's an effective business model because it relies on steady inflows from licensing, royalties, lease agreements, and the performance of its company-owned stores. But it all falls apart if franchisees aren't generating acceptable returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's isn't at that dire stage yet. But years of price increases have exhausted customers and hurt McDonald's brand, which hinges on value. A comparison would be if Walmart overly raised prices, squeezed consumers, and lost its most important brand attribute -- which is saving customers money.\n\nTo boost perceived value, McDonald's is leaning heavily on its mobile app through promotions and deals -- a way to increase engagement while standing out from the competition. It is also releasing a $5 value meal on June 25 and running the promo for roughly a month.\n\nMcDonalds just opened its 6,000th restaurant in China and plans to have 50,000 restaurants by 2027. It currently has over 40,000 restaurants. For those stores to be successful, it has to restore its image as a top value-oriented fast food establishment.\n\nDespite the challenges, McDonald's is too good a company with too cheap a valuation to ignore. The price-to-earnings ratio is just 21.5, and the dividend yield is 2.6%. McDonald's has raised its dividend for 47 consecutive years, making it one of the most reliable dividend stocks on the market.\n\nMcDonald's has its challenges and could be a poor performer in the near term. But patient investors are getting an excellent opportunity to buy this top Dow dividend stock on the cheap and collect a sizable amount of passive income while they wait for the business to turn around.\n\nEnergize your passive income stream with Chevron's high-yield dividend\n\nScott Levine (Chevron): While value investors may have considered piloting Boeing stock into their portfolios -- with it plunging nearly 30% since the start of the year -- the turbulence the company has recently endured related to safety issues has made the stock undesirable in many investors' eyes. But Chevron is another industry leader found in the Dow that value investors can rally around. The stock's enticing 4.2% forward dividend yield and track record of hiking the dividend for 37 consecutive years make it even more appealing.\n\nThe prospect of generating strong passive income from high-yield stocks is alluring, but smart investors know that it's important to verify that the high payouts are sustainable. One encouraging sign is the company's robust portfolio of assets in the Permian. From 2023 through 2027, Chevron expects to have 2,200 well locations in the Permian, and the company plans on growing this presence to more than 6,600 well locations in 2028 through 2040. This dedicated foresight to the company's long-term growth bodes well for income investors who seek assurance that the dividend can be sustained.\n\nAnother encouraging sign is management's auspicious outlook for free cash flow growth in the near term. From free cash flow (excluding working capital) of $10 billion in 2022, Chevron anticipates averaging more than 10% in annual free cash flow growth through 2027.\n\nWith shares of Chevron currently valued at about 7.7 times operating cash flow -- a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 8.3 -- today seems like an especially good time to add this dividend powerhouse to your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in 3M, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and 3M wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks are synonymous with stability and reliability. Investors search amongst these names to find companies with long track records of strong performance, healthy financials and established market presence. These stocks typically come attached to a premium price tag. Yet, even in the current market euphoria, with indices climbing to new heights by the day, a decent number of blue-chip gems are trading near their 52-week lows.\n\nDespite most blue-chip stocks continuing to post strong results in recent quarters, a decent number of them have found themselves undervalued and overlooked. Therefore, current investors have a chance to get their hands on quality names at bottom-barrel prices. Blue-chip stocks rarely trade at a discount, so it makes sense to chase such opportunities when they arise.\n\nIn this article, we look deeper into three top-notch stocks that not only boast blue-chip status but also seem to be trading at prices that don\u2019t reflect their true potential. All three stocks are trading very close to their 52-week lows despite being set to deliver record earnings this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) An image of Neutrogena products stocked on a shelf\n\nSource: Faizal Ramli/Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the first names that came to my mind when brainstorming which blue-chip stocks to include in this list. The company dominates in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors, with its diverse portfolio including various essential pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer health products.\n\nSince its wide range of products includes essentials from Band-Aids to prescription drugs, Johnson & Johnson tends to generate resilient cash flow irrespective of the underlying condition of the economy. This has allowed the company to establish a tremendous track record of earnings and dividend growth, including 61 consecutive years of dividend hikes.\n\nDespite its blue-chip status, Johnson & Johnson is trading near its 52-week lows, presenting an intriguing opportunity for investors. This is because Johnson & Johnson is poised to post record earnings this year despite its recent share price losses. Wall Street sees earnings-per-share (EPS) landing at $10.56 this year, implying a 6.2% increase from last year and a new all-time high milestone.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is the second beaten-down blue chip stock on my list. The largest player in the Quick-Service Restaurant (QSR) space, it boasts over 41,000 locations worldwide and continually expands its global footprint.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has consistently increased its same-store sales, which, along with its growing number of locations, has fueled remarkable earnings and dividend growth. The fact that 95% of McDonald\u2019s are franchised, translating to frictionless, high-margin cash flows, has been a notable factor in this success.\n\nMore specifically, McDonald\u2019s has grown its EPS and dividend-per-share (DPS) at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% and 7.6% over the past decade. To highlight McDonald\u2019s overextended track record of excellence, the company has raised its dividend for 49 consecutive years.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s growth has slowed, with comparable sales growing by just 1.9% in its most recent Q1 report. Yet, this can be attributed to outsized growth recorded in earlier periods, with Q1 marking 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth. A short-term breather to growth is to be expected.\n\nDespite the recent slowdown and the stock trading near its 52-week lows, McDonald\u2019s is still projected to achieve an EPS of $12.21 this year, suggesting another year of record-breaking profitability.\n\nAccenture (ACN) The outside view of an Accenture (ACN) office in Prague.\n\nSource: josefkubes/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final undervalued blue chip stock I\u2019ve added to my list is Accenture (NYSE:ACN). Despite its solid reputation in the professional services and consulting industry, shares have notably declined recently. This drop seems to be fueled by a dominant bearish sentiment, suggesting that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) will reduce the demand for Accenture\u2019s traditional human-delivered services.\n\nSuch a scenario could lead to a significant downturn in its sales and earnings in the foreseeable future. That said, this is only half the story. Instead of viewing AI as a threat to its business, Accenture has integrated AI into its offerings, augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing them entirely.\n\nFurther, the depth of the company\u2019s expertise and its strong client relationships provide a sturdy groundwork. They should enable Accenture to enrich its offerings further with AI capabilities from a place of strength.\n\nFinally, consistent with my earlier selections, Accenture is expected to post record profits this year. Wall Street sees EPS of $12.15 for FY2024, implying a modest but welcome year-over-year growth of 4.1%, marking another record for the consulting giant. Thus, with the stock trading near its 52-week lows, Accenture forms a compelling opportunity for bullish investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald's Insiders Sold US$7.5m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy",
        "content": "Many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman & CEO, Christopher Kempczinski, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$280 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$254. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.\n\nMcDonald's insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nMcDonald's Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. McDonald's insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$387m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The McDonald's Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, McDonald's makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing McDonald's. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for McDonald's that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Nike (NYSE:NKE) is working with Roblox with its virtual world. Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) is working with Roblox, too.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to Market.us, the metaverse market could be worth about $2.3 trillion by 2032. That being said, investors should consider jumping into some of the best metaverse stocks to buy. Here are three you may want to invest in now.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy is Roblox. Granted, recent earnings and full-year booking forecasts weren\u2019t so hot. It posted an EPS loss of 43 cents, which beat by 10 cents. Bookings of $923.76 million, up 19.4% year over year, missed by $5.34 million.\n\nIt also offered a weaker-than-expected bookings forecast, expecting bookings of $870 million to $900 million. That was below expectations of $902.5 million. It also lowered its full-year bookings forecast to between $4 billion and $4.1 billion, which is down from its prior outlook of $4.14 billion to $4.28 billion.\n\nHowever, despite the weak bookings forecast, Roblox did raise its full-year sales outlook, now seeing full-year revenue of between $3.45 billion and $3.53 billion, up from a previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Also, despite recent negativity, traders are bidding the RBLX stock higher.\n\nIn fact, since earnings, RBLX rallied from about $30 to $36.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter dropping from about $230 to $169, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is gaining momentum.\n\nFor one, the artificial intelligence story is still heating up. Two, demand for AMD chips is only expected to gain momentum. According to AMD\u2019s CEO Lisa Su, the company expects to see about $4 billion in AI chip sales, an increase of $500 million from prior estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree, analysts at Edward Jones just initiated a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on AMD. Analysts at Jefferies also initiated coverage of AMD with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, with a price target of $190 a share. AMD even just replaced Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nAMD plays a big role in the metaverse, too.\u00a0After all, companies racing forward with data centers for artificial intelligence, and even the metaverse, will need plenty of chips from companies like AMD.\n\nRoundHill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) The metaverse concept of future meta-technology engineers. 3d rendering illustration design character wireframe for networking, innovation, online communication. metaverse stocks\n\nSource: allme3d / shutterstock.com\n\nYou can always take the exchange-traded fund (ETF) route with the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nFor one, after bottoming out around $11.40, the METV ETF rallied back to $13.08, where it\u2019s still a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d From here, I\u2019d like to see the ETF closer to $20 a share, especially with the metaverse story heading up again.\n\nFurther, with an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF\u00a0is the world\u2019s largest metaverse fund and should benefit from two key areas of growth.\u00a0These include that the Metaverse\u2019s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033. And, VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026.\n\nSome of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to name a few of the top ones.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "California's new $20 minimum wage for fast-food workers has already caused a surge in restaurant prices and a decline in foot traffic since it went into effect April 1, data shows.\n\nA recent study released by Placer.ai found that as a result of the new law \u00a0which impacts restaurants with 60 or more locations \u2014 most quick-service chains have raised menu prices in the state by anywhere from the mid-single digits to mid-teens, percentage-wise, and the price hikes are hurting business. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signs legislation raising the state's fast-food workers' minimum wage to $20 an hour at SEIU Local 721 in Los Angeles on Sept. 28, 2023.\n\nThe analysis found that during February and March of this year, foot traffic at major chain restaurants in California was actually up year-over-year and higher than the national average, but that abruptly shifted after the wage hike went into effect.\n\nDuring April through May, foot traffic to fast-food restaurants in California was below the national average for seven out of eight weeks, Placer.ai said. The analytics firm said quick-service burger chains were the hardest hit.\n\nBUSINESSES \u2018FED UP\u2019 WITH CALIFORNIA'S MINIMUM WAGE HIKE AS PRICES SOAR, THOUSANDS FORCED OUT OF WORK\n\nMcDonald's, for instance, saw roughly the same year-over-year foot traffic at its California locations as the rest of its restaurants nationwide during the February-March time frame. But after the minimum wage law went into effect, McDonald's California locations \u2014 which amount to around 9% of the company's U.S. restaurants \u2014 began underperforming by almost 250 basis points.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP A McDonald's fast-food restaurant is seen in Belmont, California, on April 3, 2023.\n\nThe study showed visits to California locations during April and May also underperformed the national average for Burger King, Wendy's, Jack in the Box, In-N-Out Burger and Chipotle, which had raised its prices 6%-7% in the state to offset the wage increases.\n\nThe Placer.ai analysis also pointed to broader impacts on the restaurant industry in the state as a result of the minimum wage increases.\n\n\"It\u2019s early, but we\u2019re starting to see the ripple effect of the minimum wage increase across the broader restaurant industry,\" said R.J. Hottovy, Placer.ai's head of analytical research. \"First, we\u2019ve started to see some operators close locations in the state, especially chains that were already facing financial difficulties.\"\n\nTHESE ARE THE MOST AFFORDABLE US CITIES FOR DINING OUT AND THE ONE MOST EXPENSIVE\n\nThe study noted that the new law has led several restaurant chains to shutter locations in California, including Rubio's Coastal Grill, which cited the minimum wage hikes as one of the reasons it filed for bankruptcy last week.\n\nStory continues Passersby look in the windows of Rubio's Costal Grill on Lincoln Blvd. in Los Angeles.\n\nMeanwhile, the study said casual dining chains, which typically already paid workers more than the $20 minimum, appear to be benefiting from menu price increases at fast-food restaurants.\n\nThe data showed Olive Garden and Chili's restaurants in California actually outperformed the chains' respective national averages in foot traffic year-over-year in April.\n\nOriginal article source:California\u2019s $20 minimum wage led to fast-food price hikes, lower customer traffic, study shows\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Not all dividend stocks are worthy of a royal title like Dividend Duke (a completely made-up term, by the way). Indeed, there are Dividend Kings who have raised dividends by at least 50 straight years, a feat that\u2019s impressive but quite hard to do. Not because dividend payers can\u2019t stand up to challenges (like recessions) thrown their way, but because many firms simply weren\u2019t public in the early-to-mid 1970s to be eligible for the Dividend King title.\n\nThe future is uncertain, but that doesn\u2019t mean firms with decades (perhaps less than five decades) can\u2019t find their way to 50 consecutive years of dividend raises. We\u2019ll check out three Dividend Dukes that may, one day, rise to become Dividend Kings.\n\nTheir growth rates may also lead to better appreciation potential relative to some older, growth-lacking Dividend Kings. These dividend stocks that can help make your portfolio that much more noble.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has raised its dividend for 49 consecutive years as of this writing. It\u2019s en route to becoming a Dividend King next year despite the recent inflation-related challenges that have pressured MCD stock. McDonald\u2019s may have lost some of its reputation as a high-value fast-food chain. It used to be cheap to get a meal, especially with coupons.\n\nNowadays, you can expect to pay around $30 or more to get a meal (and treats) for two. Of course, you could knock a few dollars if you have the loyalty app, which allows you to score discounts or spend points. Still, the customers want the firm to \u201croll back\u201d prices for good rather than just running limited-time value promos.\n\nInstead of cutting prices and operating margins, McDonald\u2019s may be able to command higher prices if it improves the quality of its food. Arguably, it\u2019s already doing this with recent changes to its burgers. And with healthier Happy Meal offerings now widely available, perhaps McDonald\u2019s can also make its adult menu items a bit healthier (or less calorie-dense) to win more business.\n\nWith a nice 2.63% dividend yield and Dividend King status in sight, MCD stock looks nothing short of delicious.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has to be one of my favorite Dividend Kings. The company has raised its dividend for around 30 years straight. Though still more than two decades away from Dividend King status, I find the technology firm to be a strong candidate to benefit from the continued rise of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a strong quarter delivered at the start of the year, IBM stock seems to be known as an AI play for business nowadays. Still, I think there\u2019s way more upside to be had, even after its latest quarterly setback, which caused shares to plunge around 14% off their 10-year highs of over $191 per share.\n\nOne quarterly setback does not mean the AI growth narrative is suddenly off the table. As IBM continues spending on innovation (not just AI but quantum computing as well), its stock stands out as a fantastic deal for upside seekers and income investors alike. The dividend yield sits at 3.92% at the time of writing.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is a defense company with a fairly modest 1.94% dividend yield. The firm has hiked its dividend every year for about 33 years. Given the steady and lowly-correlated nature of the defense scene (0.64 beta, which entails above-average market risk), GD stock looks destined to become king in 18 years.\n\nWith the stock coming off all-time highs, investors may wish to watch the $81 billion defense play. Its combat and marine systems businesses have been incredibly robust of late. With a strong backlog and no shortage of orders, General Dynamics may be able to move to even higher highs in the second half, especially if management can improve margins across the board. Further, the Gulfstream business jet may provide enough catalyst to help General Dynamics extend its run.\n\nWhen writing, GD stock trades 24.1 times, trailing price-to-earnings, which seems too cheap for such a stellar blue chip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of McDonald\u2019s.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nWolfe Research upgraded 3M (MMM) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $125 price target. The company's new CEO Bill Brown \"brings The Right Stuff to 3M,\" providing more confidence in the medium-term earnings outlook, the firm tells investors in a research note. Stephens upgraded Par Technology(PAR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $60, up from $46. As a category leader in restaurant technology, Par is well positioned to capitalize on demand for loyalty, cloud-native POS and data-analytics solutions, the firm says, adding that it believes the sale of government subsidiaries simplifies the story and adds valuable capital flexibility. BofA double upgraded Kimberly-Clark(KMB) to Buy from Underperform with a price target of $160, up from $115. After Kimberly-Clark's volume inflection in Q1 following two years of volume declines, the firm sees the start of a longer-term improvement taking hold. Janney Montgomery Scott upgraded MAA (MAA) to Buy from Neutral with a $150 fair value estimate. After meeting with management, the firm is more confident in apartment real estate investment trust's near-term operating trends, and less concerned about the new supply still pervasive in MAA's core markets. Bradesco BBI upgraded PagBank (PAGS) to Outperform from Neutral with a $16 price target. The firm cites the company's higher profitability and \"attractive\" valuation for the upgrade.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nWolfe Research downgraded Roper Technologies (ROP) to Peer Perform from Outperform without a price target. The firm finds the stock's valuation more balanced, and sees a less clear path for future estimate revisions. Canaccord downgraded Cara Therapeutics(CARA) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $1, down from $10. The company announced that oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate meaningful clinical benefit versus placebo at any dose as part of the dose-finding Part A of its KOURAGE Phase 3 study in notalgia paresthetica. H.C. Wainwright and Needham also downgraded Cara Therapeutics to Neutral-equivalent ratings. Barclays downgraded NextEra Energy Partners(NEP) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $25, down from $32. With limited debt capacity should the company want to stay within its credit ratings, and an \"extremely high\" payout ratio of 95%, NextEra has limited potential options outside a distribution cut, with a reduction of at least 45% necessary, to pay off its remaining convertible equity portfolio financings, the firm tells investors in a research note. Janney Montgomery Scott downgraded Generac (GNRC) to Neutral from Buy with a fair value estimate of $154, up from $126, after having recently hosted a Fireside Chat with CFO York Ragen and Director of IR Kris Roseman. Following the management talks and a review of the firm's model, the firm thinks additional multiple expansion is unlikely and would like to receive additional clarity regarding the 2025-plus rollout of updated energy technology products before ratcheting up estimates. Goldman Sachs downgraded W. R. Berkley(WRB) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $83, down from $88. The firm says recent litigation trends, inclusive of multi-year highs in U.S. district court cases pending, bring an \"element of uncertainty\" with regard to claim cost trends, especially given increasing levels of large verdicts.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of Chipotle (CMG) with a Buy rating and $3,730 price target. The firm initiated coverage of the restaurant sector with a \"selectively constructive\" view. Goldman's top idea is Chipotle Mexican Grill. The firm also started coverage of Restaurant Brands (QSR), Sweetgreen (SG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Starbucks (SBUX) with Buy ratings. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of McDonald's(MCD) with a Neutral rating and $288 price target. The firm sees a balanced risk/reward for McDonald's given near-term risks from its national $5 value menu launch. Goldman also started coverage of Yum! Brands (YUM) and Wingstop (WING) with Neutral ratings. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Wendy's(WEN) with a Sell rating and $16 price target. The firm believes scale increasingly matters in a tougher competitive environment and sees multiple challenges in view of lower income consumer uncertainties and intensifying value competition. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Jack in the Box (JACK) with a Sell rating and $55 price target. Argus initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with a Buy rating and $190 price target. GE Vernova is a well-run, financially strong company that looks to be \"well poised\" to take advantage of megatrends such as energy transition, global electrification and global decarbonization, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays initiated coverage of NetEase (NTES) with an Equal Weight rating and $104 price target. The firm says China's online gaming market is maturing, while NetEase has high-market share and potentially peak margins.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "When it comes to targeting discounted ideas in the equities sector, undervalued blue-chip stocks offer some of the most compelling prospects. First and foremost, blue chips earn the status through decades of business and earnings expansion. In other words, they\u2019re predictable stalwarts that can be depended on in good times and bad.\n\nAs an investor, understanding this point gives you a clear advantage. Usually, when you hear about a \u201ccheap\u201d security in the financial information sector, it\u2019s tied to an exciting enterprise. Maybe it\u2019s a small-capitalization firm or a pre-revenue entity aligned to a burgeoning industry. The point is, it appears cheap based on its potential. However, potential is never guaranteed to materialize.\n\nOn the other hand, blue chips don\u2019t really deal with potential; they deal with proven realities. If they also happen to be trading at metrics below their intrinsic valuations, those are discounts you can trust. Eventually, the stalwart should rise above the muck.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, below are undervalued blue-chip stocks to put on your radar.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical giant AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) primarily offers an intriguing case for undervalued blue-chip stocks thanks to its Allergan buyout. With the acquisition of one its rivals, the company brought the anti-wrinkle treatment Botox under its belt. That\u2019s likely going to be one of the most relevant treatments because of shifting social mores.\n\nBasically, because of social media, people are more focused on their superficial qualities. As young people get older \u2013 because, you know, life and all \u2013 they will likely have a more difficult time letting go. Cynically, that\u2019s where Botox might come into play. AbbVie is a long-term play and so any valuation argument in my opinion must incorporate Botox\u2019s potential.\n\nOn paper, ABBV trades at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.99X. In contrast, the sector median for the drug manufacturing space is 1.66X. That technically makes ABBV one of the undervalued blue-chip stocks. However, as I stated earlier, the fundamentals are what makes AbbVie compelling.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that while you\u2019re waiting for the narrative to pan out, AbbVie pays a forward annual dividend yield of 3.64%.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is as much a fast-food giant as it is an icon of American business. The opening of its stores in international markets has been celebrated in history books as informal acts of diplomacy. So, it\u2019s difficult for such a massive enterprise to be considered one of the undervalued blue-chip stocks. However, a compelling case can be made here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the company suffered a slight miss in earnings for the first quarter of 2024, overall, the financial performance has been impressive. In the past four quarters, its average earnings per share reached around $2.96. This translated to an earnings surprise of nearly 6%. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate EPS to hit $12.19, an increase of 9.3% over the prior year.\n\nHowever, given the robust performance of MCD, it\u2019s possible that the company can eventually hit the high side of the earnings spectrum. That would mean EPS of $12.70 in fiscal 2024, translating to a forward multiple of 20X. Moreover, the blue-sky target for fiscal 2025 stands at $14.20. Combined with McDonald\u2019s new business initiatives, it\u2019s not an unreasonable projection.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) might not seem like an enticing proposition for undervalued blue-chip stocks. As an integrated oil and gas giant, Exxon covers multiple areas of the hydrocarbon value chain. That\u2019s a positive, obviously. However, the ideological and political machinery have emphasized the development of renewable infrastructure. Taken to its logical conclusion, XOM seems irrelevant.\n\nFundamentally, though, the world still runs on oil. And that narrative might not change substantively until all underlying infrastructural networks incorporate new energy solutions. Until then, innovations like electric vehicles may be more of a luxury item for wealthier households. So, with big oil likely to enjoy sustained relevance, that right there changes the valuation discussion.\n\nNow, on paper, nothing about Exxon seems like a particularly great deal. For example, fiscal 2024 revenue calls for 1.5% growth to $349.8 billion. That\u2019s not remarkable. However, the most optimistic target calls for sales of $435.21 billion, up 26.3% from the prior year.\n\nShould that print materialize, XOM would be trading at 1.16X projected revenue. That might be a more realistic valuation given the underappreciated demand profile for hydrocarbons.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goods inflation is finally fixed",
        "content": "Wall Street cheered the latest inflation report, which showed prices rose less than expected from April to May. Stocks jumped a snappy 1% on the news.\n\nConsumers should be cheered, too. One month\u2019s worth of economic numbers won\u2019t automatically ease the pressure on the family budget, but one important trend is convincingly going the right direction: Inflation in goods is finally getting back to normal.\n\nInflation came unleashed around this time three years ago, as vaccines helped end the COVID pandemic, cooped-up consumers started going out again, and trillions of dollars in stimulus money turbocharged spending. Since that coincided with Joe Biden\u2019s presidential term, many Americans blame Biden for eroding spending power. But it was mostly COVID-related factors that pushed goods prices up.\n\nThe pandemic triggered a huge shift in spending away from services toward goods since it was hard to travel or eat out but easy to order stuff online. Supply chain snafus also made some products scarce, and demand-supply imbalances sent prices soaring. In March of 2022, the one-year inflation rate for goods peaked at a whopping 14.2%.\n\nThe annual inflation rate for goods is now 0.1%. What matters most to consumers isn\u2019t the inflation number attached to any particular product; it\u2019s how much their paycheck buys. Here, the news is good too. During the last three years, the cost of all goods combined has risen by 14%. Earnings have risen by 14.9%. So goods are no longer taking an inordinately large bite out of the typical paycheck as they have been for much of the last two years.\n\nYes yes yes, some prices are still elevated, as the following chart shows. Food and energy are still up by more than earnings during the last three years. Those are staples that are hard to cut back on.\n\nBut other things have gone up in price by less than earnings, such as clothing, furniture, and appliances. The cost of electronics and toys actually declined during the last three years. People don\u2019t need to buy a new toaster or pair of shoes every month, but everybody needs to buy this kind of stuff sooner or later. Disinflation and deflation do help family budgets, even for non-staples.\n\nThere\u2019s more evidence that commodity prices should continue to moderate and, in some cases, decline. Gasoline prices, perhaps the best consumer proxy for overall inflation, have dropped since the government gathered the data on May inflation to a national average of around $3.45 per gallon.\n\nRetailers are cutting prices on thousands of items as shoppers get pickier and refuse to pony up for some things. Target (TGT), Walgreens (WBA), Ikea, Walmart (WMT), and other big chains have announced price cuts recently. McDonald\u2019s (MCD), Burger King, and KFC (YUM) have new bargain meal options. If the job market continues to soften, as many economists expect, that will cool demand even more and cement the return of goods inflation to normal levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nAlas, inflation is not completely tamed. The overall inflation rate is now 3.3%, a huge improvement from the 9% peak in June 2022. But the Federal Reserve\u2019s target is 2%, and nobody complained during pre-COVID times when it was a bit lower than that.\n\nThe bogeyman is now services, in particular just a few service categories. Services inflation is 5.2%, still well above the Fed\u2019s target. During the last three years, the cost of all services combined rose by 18.3%, a bit more than incomes.\n\nRent is the big one, with rental inflation running 5.3% year over year. During the last three years, rents have risen 20.4%, 5.5 percentage points more than earnings. Since housing is most people\u2019s biggest expense, that has been a budget killer. Slashing prices: Retailers, including Walmart and Target, are stepping up discounting heading into the summer of 2024 as they hope to offer frustrated shoppers some relief from higher prices. (AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez.) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nRestaurant meals are up by 21% during the last three years, in part because a shortage of workers has pushed up wages, with the cost passed on to consumers. We didn\u2019t put auto insurance on the chart above because it would skew the scale, but those costs have soared by 47.1% since 2021, largely because fancier cars cost a lot more to fix and drivers are getting into more crashes.\n\nThe trend in services is also going the right way, however. The government\u2019s measure of rent prices doesn\u2019t take into account new leases, and many economists expect rent inflation to moderate during the coming months.\n\nThe Apartment List rental index, which does account for new leases, shows a modest decline in rents from the peak levels of 2022. The latest monthly report describes the rental market as \u201csluggish,\u201d with \u201cseasonal declines steeper than usual and seasonal increases more mild.\u201d That means renters ought to have more leverage to negotiate cheaper rent when current leases expire.\n\nAs economists and politicians have learned, however, everybody has their own personal measure of inflation and rising prices can cause lasting consumer shell shock. Though the numbers show improvement, it could still be a while before Americans' estimation of the economy inflates.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Traditional Fast Food Stocks Q1 In Review: Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) Vs Peers\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the traditional fast food industry, including Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) and its peers.\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nThe 14 traditional fast food stocks we track reported a decent Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the traditional fast food stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 3.5% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nPapa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA)\n\nFounded by the eclectic John \u201cPapa John\u201d Schnatter, Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) is a globally recognized pizza delivery and carryout chain known for \u201cbetter ingredients\u201d and \u201cbetter pizza\u201d.\n\nPapa John's reported revenues of $513.9 million, down 2.5% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 5.4%.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Truck Past Any Market Jitters",
        "content": "While the soaring equity indices suggest a resounding economic recovery, those living in the real world face a different paradigm. With myriad headwinds such as elevated inflation and high borrowing costs imposing significant pain on consumers, investors may feel more comfortable considering blue-chip stocks.\n\nLike any team sports competition, the investment game features an ebb and flow. A successful market participant responds to these shifts by making prudent decisions with their holdings. One of the wisest ideas an investor can make is to consider blue-chip stocks; that is, enterprises that are well-recognized and feature robust and predictable businesses.\n\nThey\u2019re not the most exciting ideas, that\u2019s for sure. Instead, think of these corporate giants as a massive pickup truck. Unlike a more fragile sports car, you\u2019re not going to be swerving to avoid every little pothole. Instead, you\u2019re just going to run right over these nuisances.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s the privilege behind blue-chip stocks. And with that, below are enticing ideas to consider.\n\nChurch & Dwight (CHD) boxes of Arm & Hammer baking soda\n\nSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top names in the consumer defensive sector, Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) ranks among the best blue-chip stocks for its underlying utility. Offering a wide range of household and personal products, Church & Dwight \u2013 which is best known for its Arm & Hammer brand \u2013 benefits from a permanently relevant narrative. No matter what\u2019s going on with the economy, people will need the essentials like oral care products.\n\nThanks to its predictable business, CHD is relatively easy to trust. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average earnings per share reached roughly 82 cents. When stacked against analysts\u2019 expectations, Church & Dwight saw an average earnings surprise of 8.5%. That\u2019s not bad at all.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), the company posted net income of $780.1 million or EPS of $3.16. Revenue during this time hit $5.94 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate EPS to rise 9.15% year-over-year to hit $3.46. On the top line, the household goods giant could ring up $6.13 billion in sales, up 4.5% YOY.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA company that really needs no introduction, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) specializes in the home-improvement retailer business. What makes the company so intriguing is that stuff goes wrong all the time. Call it Murphy\u2019s law or some other phenomenon of misfortune. When it rains, it pours. And no, these things occur whether the market is in a bull or bear cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, Home Depot isn\u2019t the most exciting idea out there. However, because stuff happens all the time, the retailer serves the public in its moment of need. As a result, it enjoys consistency. During the past four quarters, its average EPS came in around $3.73. This performance translated to an average earnings surprise of 2.15%.\n\nIn the TTM period, Home Depot posted net income of $14.87 billion or earnings of $14.91 per share. Revenue reached $151.83 billion. For the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for modest growth of 1.2% in EPS to hit $15.29. On the top line, sales may land at $153.96 billion, up around 1%. Again, while not exciting, HD is one of the blue-chip stocks that should keep your portfolio pointed in the right direction.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother massive retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) falls under the big-box variety. Featuring a one-stop-shop solution, one of the company\u2019s top benefits as it relates to blue-chip stocks to buy is the underlying everyday low pricing. By focusing on volume, Walmart has taken a massive share of the consumer market (both discretionary and essential).\n\nWhile WMT may be a predictable idea for blue-chip stocks, it\u2019s one of the ideas that you can depend on. During the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average EPS reached 54.5 cents. Against analysts\u2019 expectations, the performance translated to an earnings surprise of 8.28%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, the big-box retailer posted net income of $18.94 billion or earnings of $2.33 per share. Revenue during this cycle hit $657.33 billion. Its latest quarterly revenue growth rate (YOY) comes in at 6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts seeking EPS of $2.43, up almost 20% YOY. Revenue may reach $676.64 billion, a 13.7% increase from the prior year\u2019s tally of $594.85 billion.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the iconic corporate giants of the U.S., McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) represents one of the top-tier blue-chip stocks to buy. Over the years, the Golden Arches has faced challenges, from rising competitors in the fast-casual space to concerns regarding the nutritional value of its offerings. However, the company benefits from massive brand power and awareness. It\u2019s also demonstrating a knack for reinventing itself to account for shifting consumer behaviors.\n\nDuring the past four quarters, McDonald\u2019s posted an average EPS of almost $2.96. In all fairness, it missed analysts\u2019 projections for Q1 2024 of earnings of $2.72 per share by two pennies. However, even with the miss, the company\u2019s average earnings surprise during the aforementioned period landed at just under 6%. That demonstrates the enterprise\u2019s consistency.\n\nIn the TTM period, the Golden Arches posted net income of $8.6 billion or EPS of $11.76. Revenue reached $25.76 billion, with its latest quarterly revenue growth rate hitting 4.6%. For fiscal 2024, EPS may rise 9.3% to reach $12.19. On the top line, sales could come in at $26.62 billion, up a stout 11.8% from the prior year.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancial services giant Visa (NYSE:V) \u2013 which specializes in card payment solutions \u2013 presents a tricky case for blue-chip stocks to buy. It certainly represents one of the top-tier corporate institutions. However, questions exist about the viability of the sector. In particular, consumers (especially younger ones) are turning to credit cards to make ends meet.\n\nCombined with rising delinquencies, this dynamic presents challenges. However, if you wanted to look at the situation as a glass half-full, you could say that piling on the debt reflects broader confidence in the American system. Plus, the labor market has generally been robust, perhaps indicating that the nation could work through its troubles.\n\nSo far, the financials appear compelling. During the past four quarters, average EPS landed at $2.30. This performance translated to an earnings surprise of 2.93%. For fiscal 2024, experts are projecting EPS growth of 24.4% to reach $9.95. On the top line, sales could expand by almost 21% YOY to hit $35.94 billion.\n\nEven better, Visa\u2019s growth projections exceed that of rivals Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nOne of the more boring and uninspiring ideas for blue-chip stocks, legacy tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) nevertheless deserves some attention. To be sure, the company has been overshadowed by its younger counterparts. However, \u201cBig Blue\u201d is no slouch. It still offers tremendous acumen in artificial intelligence, deep learning, cybersecurity and even the blockchain. There may be underappreciated value here.\n\nFurther, after going through a volatile period in late April, it appears that IBM stock has stabilized. That could be good news particularly because of its passive income. Right now, the company offers a forward annual dividend yield of 3.93%. As well, IBM posted an average EPS of $2.44 during the past four quarters. In terms of earnings surprise, this performance resulted in an average of 4.9%.\n\nNet income during the TTM period reached $8.15 billion or earnings of $8.82 per share. Revenue came in at $62.07 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS of $9.94. If so, that would imply 3.3% growth YOY. On the top line, IBM may ring up $63.03 billion, up 1.9% from last year.\n\nShell (SHEL) Shell logo on a gas station in Iceland. SHEL stock\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest hydrocarbon players, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) ranks among the supermajors. These integrated oil and gas stalwarts cover multiple segments of the energy value chain. To be sure, the hydrocarbon sector is a little bit tricky to decipher. With prices slipping, this dynamic implies that there is reduced global demand for fossil fuels.\n\nPart of the reason for the deflated view centers on Ukraine. Its defense forces have begun attacking invading Russia\u2019s oil refineries. In turn, the Russians must sell their crude oil at deep discounts to account for the loss of revenue for their refined products. That might not be great for SHEL stock. However, geopolitical dynamics can always shift unpredictably.\n\nOne area to consider is the Middle East. Tensions have cooled but this inflamed region could light up again. If so, global oil supplies may come under threat, which could be cynically positive for SHEL.\n\nNotably, analysts are looking for fiscal 2024 revenue to reach $346.79 billion, up 9.5% YOY. Further, the high-side target comes in at $443.5 billion, a massive gap up. Watch this space as SHEL could be one of the best blue-chip stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These elements raise market value and help the company make a mark on the list of recession-proof stocks.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.\n\nSource: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe parent business of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes, Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR), prospers from its fast-food brands worldwide. Despite economic swings, the company targets essential consumer demand with reasonably priced eating alternatives.\n\nWith a\u00a04.2% YoY rise in comparable sales and an 8.4% growth in net restaurant revenue (Q1 2024), the overseas segment contributed to an 11.6% increase in system-wide sales. Despite difficulties in some areas, Restaurant Brands\u2019 global operations showed tenacity and kept growing. Digital sales accounted for more than 50% of system sales internationally, showing how well Restaurant Brands\u2019 non-domestic markets adopted digital platforms.\n\nFurther, despite comparatively stagnant traffic, Burger King U.S. outperformed the industry with a\u00a03.9% YoY gain\u00a0in comparable sales. Restaurant Brands\u2019 \u201cReclaim the Flame\u201d\u00a0strategy, which focuses on core stocks like flame-grilled hamburgers and strong value messaging, has been successfully implemented, as seen by this increase. Hence, these initiatives enhance client happiness and sales performance, making Restaurant Brands a recession-proof stock.\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) is a strong option amid economic uncertainty since it caters to customers\u2019 desire to invest in their living spaces by providing necessary goods and services for do-it-yourself projects and upgrades. Lowe\u2019s saw an increase in Pro and online sales in Q1 2024 despite a 4.1% YoY fall in comparable sales overall. Further, with a strategic focus on an underrepresented group, Lowe\u2019s targets small- to medium-sized professionals, who are estimated to make up half the $500 billion Pro market.\n\nMoreover, investments in growing capabilities demonstrate a focus on providing professional clients with quick services, such as managing larger order deliveries to project sites and building more Lowe\u2019s Pro supply outlets. Despite many obstacles, online\u00a0sales increased 1%\u00a0YoY in the first quarter, demonstrating Lowe\u2019s dedication to its online presence. Offering same-day delivery alternatives\u00a0through a partnership with Shipped and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) improves accessibility and convenience for customers. Therefore, these fundamental elements make the company a top recession-proof stock.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Here's How Pfizer Stock (and Pharma) Stand to Benefit From Mylan Deal. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe multinational pharmaceutical company Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has solid demand for its goods regardless of economic situation. It produces a wide range of medications and vaccines, including essential healthcare items like Comirnaty (the COVID-19 vaccine). Pfizer announced $14.9 billion in total sales for Q1 2024.\n\nMoreover, the robustness and diversity of the company\u2019s product range are demonstrated by its capacity to produce substantial revenue and achieve double-digit operational growth, even when COVID-related goods\u00a0are excluded. This variety lessens the effect of changes in the market for particular goods.\n\nFurther, in Q1 2024, operating sales in the oncology segment\u00a0increased by 19% YoY. The significant rise in oncology sales demonstrates\u00a0Pfizer\u2019s strong position and the market demand for its cancer treatments. Overall, this focus on cost-effectiveness improves performance, expands margins and supports Pfizer\u2019s position as a recession-proof stock.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a diverse healthcare company in the consumer health, pharmaceutical and medical device sectors. It offers\u00a0important\u00a0healthcare solutions that are in demand year-round.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Johnson & Johnson reported\u00a0$21.4 billion in worldwide revenue, a 3.9% YoY increase. Moreover, with the COVID-19 vaccine taken out of the picture, operational sales increased by 7.6% YoY globally. The U.S. market grew at a rate of 7.8%, which suggests the company\u2019s home market is well-established.\n\nAdditionally, at $13.6 billion in global sales and growing at a\u00a02.5% annual pace, Innovative Medicine remains a\u00a0major source of income for Johnson & Johnson. Prominent oncology brands, including Darzalex, Carvykti and Erleada, helped fuel\u00a0substantial\u00a0expansion. Specifically, Darzalex alone saw an incredible 21% growth rate, and Tremfya saw a notable rise of 27.6% in the immunology sector. Overall, these core strengths make the company a standout contender for recession-proof stocks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), the fast-food restaurant giant, attracts consumers worldwide. It offers reasonably priced menu selections and is a well-known brand, enabling it to remain a mainstay in the fast-food sector even in recessionary times.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, McDonald\u2019s has had comparable top-line growth for\u00a013 consecutive quarters. Moreover, comparable sales for Q1 boosted by\u00a030% over the previous four years. Positive comparative sales growth over time shows the high edge of McDonald\u2019s marketing tactics to draw in consumers and boost revenues. The company can adjust to shifting consumer tastes and market conditions while retaining its competitive edge.\n\nFurther, McDonald\u2019s held a biannual reunion outside North America and welcomed over\u00a015K guests from almost 100 markets, showcasing the brand\u2019s worldwide reach. Due to its global presence, McDonald\u2019s can access a wide range of markets, laying a solid foundation for long-term growth.

        "title": "Trade of the Day: Bet Against the Bears on Krispy Kreme (DNUT) Stock",
        "content": "When the dust settled after Monday\u2019s trading session, shares of doughnut retailer and wholesaler Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) found themselves up more than 6%. Driving the positive sentiment was the company\u2019s partnership with McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). The deal could potentially expand DNUT\u2019s total addressable market. However, the bears don\u2019t see it that way, presenting a compelling contrarian trade for DNUT stock.\n\nKrispy Kreme saw investor enthusiasm amid rising expectations for its upcoming deal with the fast-food giant. Under the agreement, Krispy Kreme doughnuts will be sold at thousands of locations under the Golden Arches brand. For Krispy Kreme, it will open a whole new avenue within the fast-casual eatery space. It also benefits McDonald\u2019s, especially as it adds value to its breakfast menu.\n\nNotably, analyst Bill Chappell raised his price target for DNUT stock to $15 from $13. Chappell believes that the partnership will \u201caccelerate revenue growth\u201d for Krispy Kreme. However, many traders don\u2019t feel the same way.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnusual Options Activity Underlines Bearish Sentiment\n\nFollowing the close of the June 10 session, DNUT stock ranked among the top names in terms of unusual stock options volume. This data focuses on the difference between current volume and the average volume over the trailing month. Primarily, it enables retail investors to better understand what the smart money may be putting its funds into.\n\nIn the case of DNUT stock options, total volume reached 10,564 contracts against an open interest reading of 48,694 contracts. The difference between Monday\u2019s session volume and its 30-day average came out to nearly 232%. Notably, call volume outweighed put volume by a ratio of almost 40 to 1.\n\nAt first glance, such a ratio favoring calls seems strongly bullish. However, calls can be sold, which may have negative implications. Indeed, DNUT\u2019s options flow screener \u2013 which focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional investors \u2013 shows that net trade sentiment landed at $169,000 below breakeven, thus favoring the bears.\n\nAmong options with bearish sentiment, the biggest premium came out to $116,100. This was for the 2025 Jan. 17 $10 (sold) call. In contrast, among options with bullish sentiment, the biggest premium reached only $11,400.\n\nHowever, with Krispy Kreme beating its consensus revenue target in the first quarter, there\u2019s reasonable hope that the company can match analysts\u2019 view for fiscal 2024 sales, which stands at $1.79 billion. If so, assuming a shares outstanding count of 168.73 million, DNUT stock would be trading at 1.07x projected sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s pretty close to the restaurant sector\u2019s average sales multiple of 0.99x. Given the brand power and compelling McDonald\u2019s deal, DNUT stock could be relatively undervalued.\n\nTrade of the Day: Buy DNUT Stock Against Bearish Pressure\n\nDue to the underappreciated value tied to DNUT stock, I\u2019m more inclined to be a buyer rather than a seller. For those who want to take the risk, the next logical target would be the $12 price point.\n\nChart by Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace.com\n\nThroughout the past 52 weeks, there have been three pronounced efforts to drive DNUT stock below this threshold. One attempt occurred in October and the other occurred in March. The third attempt last month was ultimately successful.\n\nThus, for the bulls to regain credibility, they must drive Krispy Kreme\u2019s per-share price above the $12 price point. Notably, among Wall Street analysts, DNUT stock enjoys a unanimous strong buy rating with an average price target of $20. So, $12 is a very conservative target.\n\nFor those who really want to ramp up their risk-reward profile, the 2025 Jan. 17 $12.50 call could be enticing because it affords plenty of time for the analyst view to come right. If DNUT stock reaches $20 sooner than Jan. 17 of next year, the profit could be enormous.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for McDonald's is US$289 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$256 suggests McDonald's is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$312 analyst price target for MCD is 7.9% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nIs McDonald's Fairly Valued?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$8.42b US$9.01b US$10.6b US$11.4b US$12.4b US$13.3b US$14.0b US$14.6b US$15.1b US$15.6b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x7 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 6.57% Est @ 5.31% Est @ 4.43% Est @ 3.82% Est @ 3.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1%  US$7.8k US$7.7k US$8.4k US$8.3k US$8.4k US$8.3k US$8.1k US$7.8k US$7.5k US$7.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$80b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$16b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (8.1%\u2013 2.4%) = US$281b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$281b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$129b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$209b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$256, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.240. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for McDonald's\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For McDonald's, we've compiled three additional factors you should assess:\n\nRisks: For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for McDonald's that you should be aware of.

        "title": "Profiting from the Crowd: 3 Stocks Set to Surge on Retail Investor Enthusiasm",
        "content": "Many people are looking for stocks to buy, driven by just one thing: fear. Whether it is the fear of losing it all or the fear of missing out (FOMO), investors tend to run in packs. That is why it pays to be contrarian. Zig when the market zags, or as Warren Buffett says, be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\n\nDoing the opposite of what everyone else is doing is how you can handsomely profit from the \u201cwisdom\u201d of crowds.\n\nSo where are we now? The Chicago Board of Options (CBOE) oversees the Volatility Index, commonly called the VIX. It measures the volatility investors expect in the stock market. The lower the index, the more bullish investors are. The higher, the more fearful they tend to be.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRight now, the VIX sits right around 13, which suggests bullishness (between 0 and 15 is a bullish sentiment). Arguably, direction is more important than location. Which way the index is heading can reveal more about investor mindset than where it is at any given moment. Today, the VIX is falling.\n\nIn mid-April, the index was just below 20, which generally means normal market conditions. However, just as the pandemic struck in March 2020, the VIX soared at an all-time high 82.69.\n\nAccording to the VIX, retail investor enthusiasm remains upbeat today. Other indices, such as the CNN Business Fear and Greed Index, suggest fear is driving the market to new highs.\n\nThis seems to be two sides of the same coin. As the stock market goes higher, FOMO is kicking in. Investors can use that to their advantage. Below are three stocks to buy that are poised to surge from the crowd wanting in.\n\nStocks to Buy: Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocks\n\nSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsidering Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) has already tripled in value in 2024, getting in now might seem like I\u2019m encouraging investors to do what I just warned about\u2014getting onboard late after all the profits were made. However, the biotech stock still has more gas left in the engine to power further gains.\n\nMuch of its growth is already related to its weight-loss therapy in clinical trials. VK2735 reported positive Phase 2 trial results earlier this year, and because it is an oral treatment rather than an injection like Ozempic from Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) or Zepbound from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), the market opportunity is much larger.\n\nIf that was all Viking had going for it, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. However, the biotech just reported positive results from its \u201cbest-in-class\u201d therapy, VK2809, for liver disease. The treatment seems to stop the additional fibrosis formation due to the fatty tissue buildup in the liver. Left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis. Viking previously reported that VK2809 led to significant reductions in liver fatty tissue.\n\nStory continues\n\nViking Therapeutics stock is down 43% from its 52-week high. Yet, with even more therapies in its portfolio and positive developments on its lead candidates, VKTX stock looks ready to surge.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not quite as exciting as the biotech world, but McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) recent introduction of a new $5 value meal could be just as important to the fast-food joint. Consumers have been walloped by a lack of job growth, anemic wage gains, and high inflation and interest rates. They have reeled in spending on most goods beyond necessities.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s used to be a place families could go to get a cheap, tasty meal quickly, but the burger shop\u2019s lack of value in its meal selection kept many away. The restaurant chain warned earlier this year that growth would moderate in 2024, and in its first-quarter earnings report, we saw that happen. Global comparable sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, and it missed profit projections for the first time in two years.\n\nThat\u2019s why the new value meal offering is important. This shows that McDonald\u2019s again focuses on its core customers and their need for low-cost food options. That could spark a turnaround in its stock, currently down 12% year-to-date. Shares are near their 52-week low and is one of the best stocks to buy before they begin a new run higher.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Viking Therapeutics, buying cybersecurity leader Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) now is like closing the barn door after the horse ran off. The stock just reported earnings that have the stock popping 12% on the news. And that\u2019s after shares were already up 28% this year and had doubled over the past 12 months.\n\nYes, maybe it would have been better to buy the stock yesterday or last year when I identified Crowdstrike as a \u201cstrong buy\u201d in cybersecurity, but there is plenty of profit opportunity left. The threat of hackers and cybercrime has never been bigger. LexisNexis Risk Solutions says \u201chuman-initiated digital attacks\u201d are up 19% globally from last year.\n\nThat explains why Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue jumped 33% year-over-year while it produced 17 cents per share in profits this quarter versus break-even last year. Net new average recurring revenue also grew\u00a022% for the year-ago period to $212 million, with a record free cash flow of $322 million.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s business remains hot, and there seems to be no let-up in how high it can soar. Definitely one of the best stocks to buy!\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently compiled the list of 25 Best Dividend Aristocrats Stocks According to Analysts. Since McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\u00a0is part of our list, we have analyzed the stock in detail.\n\nThe age-old debate of investing in dividend growth or high-yield stocks continues to reappear within the dividend investing realm. Between these two, dividend growth is currently the favored option in the market as investors seek out strategies to grow their income over time. In this regard, investors turn to dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. These stocks have delivered strong returns over the years regardless of market conditions. Between February 2005 and December 2023, dividend aristocrats delivered a 12.50% return in falling interest rate periods and an 11.5% return in rising interest rate periods, according to data by Bloomberg.\n\nNumerous analysts have pointed out the long-term potential of dividend growth stocks, a sentiment echoed by Warren Buffett\u2019s investment in Coca-Cola. Back in August 1994, Berkshire Hathaway completed its acquisition of 400 million shares in the company, worth $1.3 billion. Berkshire initially received a cash dividend of $75 million from Coca-Cola in 1994, the amount which surged to $704 million in 2022. This shows a remarkable growth potential of dividend-paying investments over the long term.\n\nWith investors showing a growing preference for dividend-paying stocks, major tech companies started initiating their dividend policies this year. Mark Iong, an equity fund manager at Homestead Advisers, expressed his approval of this move by tech companies in one of his recent interviews with Bloomberg. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cDividends will be table-stakes for big tech going forward. I think if you don\u2019t pay one, it will now be taken as a sign your business is more volatile. What\u2019s exciting is they are doing dividends and buybacks simultaneously, while also cutting costs and growing, which is them stepping on the pedal for profits across the board.\u201d\n\nNot limited to the tech sector alone, companies across the broader market are showing a strong commitment to dividends this year. Though these equities lagged behind the market last year, their outlook remains strong this year. According to a recent report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, in the first quarter of 2024, companies in the index paid $151.6 billion in dividends, up from $146.8 billion paid during the same period last year. In addition, 796 companies reported dividend hikes during the quarter, amounting collectively to $22.7 billion. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, expects that the index will report a 6% year-over-year increase in dividend payments in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks to buy according to analysts. Is McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) the Best Consumer Dividend Aristocrat Stock?\n\nA retail employee stocking shelves with consumer packaged goods/manufacturing products.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor our list, we first scanned a list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks, which are the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. From this group, we picked stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential, as of May 26. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 920 funds as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\n\nUpside Potential as of May 26: 17.8%\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is next on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The company's quarterly dividend currently stands at $1.67 per share and its stock has a dividend yield of 2.5%. It holds a 47-year track record of consistent dividend growth.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s revenue has remained consistent over the years because of the company's franchise business model and global spread. There are roughly 41,800 McDonald's restaurants across 75 countries and 95% of these restaurants are franchised. The company's stock is down by 13% year-to-date as investors are concerned about lower margins and a slowdown in growth. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) expects its operating profit margin to remain flat in 2024 and has forecasted single-digit revenue growth.\n\nNevertheless, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) remains one of the largest fast-food restaurant operators in the world and one of the best fast food stocks to buy according to analysts. The company is currently facing challenges due to lower-income households reducing their spending and switching to eating at home, but the management has assured investors that they will address the affordability issues.\n\nAccording to our records, 63 hedge funds held shares of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) with a total value of $2.3 billion, as of the end of March. With over 2.3 million shares, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\n\nOverall MCD ranks 13th among the best dividend aristocrat stocks according to analysts, but it ranks below Target. You can visit 25 Best Dividend Aristocrats Stocks According to Analysts to see other dividend aristocrats that are on analysts\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of dividend growth stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (MCD) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has gained 0.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMcDonald's is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.17 points to a change of +1.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.17 indicates a change of +8.2% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MCD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.62 billion and $28.21 billion estimates indicate +4.4% and +6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $2.70 for the same period compares with $2.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.01%. The EPS surprise was -0.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, McDonald's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Restaurant Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "The quick-serve restaurant scene has been rocked of late, thanks in part to price increases that probably came in too quick, too fast. Undoubtedly, inflation has been the scapegoat for many firms to pin their excessive price increases on. If prices aren\u2019t taking off, then it\u2019s shrinkflation that\u2019s caused many to get far less for their dollar. The fast-food firms haven\u2019t shrunk down their meals markedly. However, they have seemingly been jacking up prices as though it\u2019s going out of style. This led us to create this list of undervalued restaurant stocks.\n\nWith the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge (core PCE) coming in quite tame, up just 0.2% for April, inflation is, indeed, on its way to going out of style. And the fast-food industry could be one of the first to roll back on prior price increases.\n\nWhether such price reductions are temporary, as will be the case with McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and its new $5 meal that\u2019s going away after a month, remains the big question. In this piece, we\u2019ll check out three undervalued restaurant stocks that I think have the means to make a comeback as value menus (rather than price hikes) become the name of the game.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo list of cheap fast-food stocks would be complete without the Golden Arches. McDonald\u2019s has been at the center of attention when it comes to absurd price increases. These have popped up amid these latter rounds of the inflation boxing match. Indeed, McDonald\u2019s food has gotten noticeably pricier lately. The big problem here is that far too many people have taken notice.\n\nCould it be that the Big Mac index has gone too far? This index is an informal inflation gauge that tracks prices of the iconic burger over time or across different markets. That\u2019s a definite possibility. It\u2019s up to management to convince the customers that it\u2019s still an affordable place to eat.\n\nMany customers are upset that the recently announced $5 menu deal will end in July. Others view the meal as not giving enough bang for one\u2019s buck. The meal, which includes one McChicken or McDouble, four chicken nuggets, small fries, and a small drink, sounds good on paper, though. Still, I\u2019m unsure if the limited-time promotion will be a net positive for MCD stock come late summer.\n\nCustomers don\u2019t just want limited deals; they want something more permanent. Either way, I\u2019m confident management can hit the right spot as it gives customers value without causing franchisees to fret over potential losses from deals that eat into margins. At 22.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), MCD stock looks like the best deal of all.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike McDonald\u2019s stock, which is down and out, Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) is firing on all cylinders with its glorious comeback. With DPZ stock now up over 75% from its lows of February 2023, Domino\u2019s shows us all that it is possible to gain in a world hit by inflation.\n\nIn the first quarter, Domino\u2019s delivered more pizzas and did so faster on a year-over-year basis. Points-based loyalty programs, limited promos, and teaming up with Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) Eats are part of the reasons for solid recent results.\n\nHowever, the high perception of value is likely why Domino\u2019s is zigging while many of its peers are lagging. The pizza still tastes great and hot, thanks to blistering delivery speeds. And the price hikes just don\u2019t seem to have been as noticeable. At least not to the extent of some of the meals that McDonald\u2019s has been serving up.\n\nDomino\u2019s comeback amid inflation has been impressive and should serve as an example for firms seeking to gain similar traction. With newfound momentum and a modest 33.0 times forward P/E, DPZ stock is shaping up to be a delicious buy for summer. This is easily one of the most undervalued restaurant stocks.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) The Shake Shack (SHAK) on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, USA\n\nSource: Here Now / Shutterstock.com\n\nShake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) is a fast-food chain that aims to differentiate itself as more premium than its rivals. Undoubtedly, Shake Shack food is made to order in a fancier restaurant with modernized d\u00e9cor. Additionally, the firm insists it\u2019s using high-quality ingredients to better cater to consumer wants. However, there\u2019s only one problem with Shake Shack\u2019s premium \u201cfast casual\u201d experience: the higher costs associated, especially amid inflation.\n\nEither way, it seems like consumers have been more than willing to pay a bit more to get higher-quality food. Over the past year, SHAK stock has surged over 33% on the back of steady sales growth, and the run may not be over as Shake Shack looks to enhance margins without compromising on quality. Once inflation dies down and consumers have more cash to splurge on a fancier burger and fries, the setup could look really good for Shake Shack.\n\nThe secret sauce in fast-food stock gains really has been a laser focus on quality rather than minimizing prices. As a perfect fast-casual chain to profit from the middle-class consumer, I\u2019d not sleep on the stock as it corrects off its 52-week high just shy of $110 per share.

        "content": "Dividends are a main reason investors buy stocks. Equally important, dividends are often the reason investors hold onto a stock. Companies have accepted these facts. So, many publicly traded companies use their dividend payments to keep shareholders content. And it makes them eager to maintain a position in their stock.\n\nCertain companies make raising their dividend payout to shareholders a priority. Yet, others even issue special one-time dividends when times are particularly good and they are sitting on piles of excess cash. Blue-chip companies, which are often mature and slow growing, tend to make raising their dividend and rewarding shareholders a focus.\n\nLet\u2019s examine three high dividend-yielding companies that are primed to delight their shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimply stated, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one of the best dividend stocks around.\n\nEarlier this year, the soft drink maker raised its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 5.4%. Coca-Cola now pays its stockholders a quarterly dividend of 48.5 cents per share, up from 46 cents previously. The dividend yield on KO stock is now 3.03% based on the current share price. Furthermore, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend payment for 62 consecutive years.\n\nAlso, the consistent annual increases place Coke in a select group of companies known as \u201cdividend kings,\u201d which are publicly traded companies that have grown their dividend payments for 50 consecutive years or longer. Interestingly, Coca-Cola\u2019s arch rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) recently joined the dividend king club, having raised its dividend for 51 consecutive years. PepsiCo\u2019s dividend yield currently stands at 3.12%. KO stock has risen 7% so far this year.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorld\u2019s largest bank JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) continues to reward its shareholders. In March of this year, the lender raised its quarterly dividend payment for the second time in six months as it reported record profits. JPMorgan Chase hiked its dividend by 9.50% to $1.15 a share. Previously, the bank paid a dividend of $1.05 per share. JPM stock now has a dividend yield of 2.31%.\n\nAlso, the latest dividend increase was announced after JPMorgan reported a record profit of $49.50 billion for all of 2023. It was the second time in less than a year that the company raised its dividend payout to stockholders. The company previously adjusted its dividend in October 2023, taking it to $1.05 a share from $1. News of the record profit and dividend increase come as JPM stock has risen 43% in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast autumn, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) lifted its quarterly dividend payment by 10%.\n\nStarting in December, the quick service restaurant chain began paying its stockholders a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share, up from $1.52 previously. The higher payment gives McDonald\u2019s a dividend yield of 2.54% based on the share price. Over the past decade, the Golden Arches has more than doubled its annual dividend payment, taking it to $6.68 a share per year from $3.08.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s paid its first dividend to shareholders in 1976 and has increased it every year since. Notably, the company is known as a \u201cdividend aristocrat,\u201d which is a publicly traded concern that has raised its dividend payout for 25 consecutive years or longer. Therefore, McDonald\u2019s is on the cusp of becoming a dividend king if it continues raising its dividend for three more years. MCD stock has declined 12% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide McDonald's with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's' Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, McDonald's has grown EPS by 20% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. McDonald's maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 10% to US$26b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for McDonald's' future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre McDonald's Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$189b company like McDonald's. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$401m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of McDonald's but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add McDonald's To Your Watchlist?\n\nYou can't deny that McDonald's has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted  2 warning signs for McDonald's you should be aware of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Hidden Treasures: 3 Dow Stocks That Deserve MUCH More Investor Love",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index including 30 of the most prominent publicly-listed American businesses. It is considered broadly representative of the U.S. economy and its overall strength. The firms listed in the Dow 30 are among the very best within their respective sectors. In short, Dow Jones stocks are among the best of the best.\n\nThat said, they aren\u2019t infallible and don\u2019t benefit from strong demand all the time. That is the case with the three Dow stocks discussed below. Each is undervalued presently meaning the markets aren\u2019t showing their love. That relative lack of demand creates an opportunity for investors who would be wise to act on lower prices.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what makes those three undervalued Dow stocks so interesting at the moment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's (MCD) building with logo at sunset\n\nSource: ATIKAN PORNCHAIPRASIT / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is one of many stocks currently suffering through a long anticipated pullback in consumer spending. That pullback is part of the broader reason that many consumer-oriented retailers are currently offering discounts, including McDonald\u2019s. Still, despite the pushback regarding pricing, McDonald\u2019s is doing fine.\n\nThe company\u2019s first quarter performance was pretty much in line with what was expected by Wall Street. Earnings per share clocked in at $2.70 whereas Wall Street had expected $2.72. The company reported $6.17 billion in revenues, in line with the $6.16 billion expected. Yes, boycotts in the Middle East are hurting the company and yes, consumers are demanding affordability. But there was no surprise from McDonald\u2019s in terms of revenue or earnings.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is working swiftly to address affordability concerns. The company will launch a $5 value meal for a month beginning Jun. 25. It\u2019s also facing pushback from franchisee owners who are not willing to absorb the discount prices. Something tells me McDonald\u2019s is going to win that battle. Something also tells me that the claims regarding pricing were overstated as well. Thus, I expect McDonald\u2019s to rebound creating real returns for investors.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) cisco (CSCO) logo on an office building\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is usually one of my favorite Dow stock picks for a number of reasons. I like the firm\u2019s secular exposure to networking growth opportunities, especially in light of the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). I also like it for its stability and relatively high dividend yield of 3.4%. The company hasn\u2019t reduced that dividend since 2011 and it benefits from a very healthy payout ratio of 0.45. There aren\u2019t many other Silicon Valley tech firms that offer such a combination of broad exposure and stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco Systems is also a stock that offers deep value as measured by P/E ratio. The company\u2019s current 15.5 P/E ratio is not only lower than its median value over the last decade but also lower than 75% of its competitors.\n\nEqually importantly, Cisco Systems is undertaking something of a transition as it relates to revenue generation. The company recently closed its Splunk acquisition and that should rapidly shift its revenue mix toward recurring software sales as opposed to one-off hardware sales that have traditionally dominated its business.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the three dominant credit card companies. I\u2019d argue that it is the best stock of those three, although each is strong.\n\nThe most important reason for that assertion is that American Express has outperformed both Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) this year and over the past five years. There are strong reasons to invest in any of them but if forced to pick one, make it American Express.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings report released in mid-April shows just how strong the company is. Earnings increased by 39% during the first quarter on revenues that jumped by 11%.\n\nThere\u2019s some irony in American Express\u2019 outperformance over its rivals given that credit card stock has the lowest P/E ratio of the three at 19.5. P/E ratios of the other two are above 30. It\u2019s a strong indication of just how undervalued American Express continues to be relative to its main competition.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 McDonald's lost a European Union trademark dispute over the Big Mac name after a top European Union court sided Wednesday with Irish fast food rival Supermac\u2019s in a long-running legal battle.\n\nThe EU General Court said in its judgment that the U.S. fast food giant failed to prove that it was genuinely using the Big Mac label over a five-year period for chicken sandwiches, poultry products or restaurants.\n\nThe Big Mac is a hamburger made of two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles and Big Mac sauce. It was invented in 1968 by a Pennsylvania franchisee who thought the company needed a sandwich that appealed to adults.\n\nThe decision is about more than burger names. It opens the door for Galway-based Supermac's expansion into other EU countries. The dispute erupted when Supermac's applied to register its company name in the EU as it drew up expansion plans. McDonald's objected, saying consumers would be confused because it already trademarked the Big Mac name.\n\nSupermac's filed a 2017 request with the EU's Intellectual Property Office to revoke McDonald's Big Mac trademark registration, saying the U.S. company couldn't prove that it had used the name for certain categories that aren't specifically related to the burger over five years. That's the window of time in Europe that a trademark has to be used before it can be taken away.\n\nAfter the regulator partially approved Supermac's request, McDonald's appealed to the EU court.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s has not proved that the contested mark has been put to genuine use\" in connection with chicken sandwiches, food made from poultry products or operating restaurants and drive-throughs and preparing take-out food, the court said, according to a press summary of its decision.\n\nSupermac's portrayed the decision as a David and Goliath-style victory. Managing Director Pat McDonagh accused McDonald\u2019s of \u201ctrademark bullying to stifle competition.\"\n\n\u201cThis is a significant ruling that takes a common-sense approach to the use of trademarks by large multi-nationals. It represents a significant victory for small businesses throughout the world,\" McDonagh said in a statement.\n\nThe Irish company doesn't sell a sandwich called the Big Mac but does have one called the Mighty Mac with the same ingredients.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s was unfazed by the ruling, which can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the bloc\u2019s highest court, but only on points of law.\n\n\u201cThe decision by the EU General Court does not affect our right to use the \u2018BIG MAC\u2019 trademark,\u201d the company said in a press statement. \u201cOur iconic Big Mac is loved by customers all across Europe, and we\u2019re excited to continue to proudly serve local communities, as we have done for decades.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Let\u2019s explore the three best consumer stocks to buy in June 2024. These companies have demonstrated resilience and the ability to capitalize on key trends driving the consumer sector. By focusing on these top performers, investors can potentially benefit from the continued growth and success of these businesses.\r\n\r\nConsumer stocks can be either defensive plays or those that are more cyclical in nature. Defensive consumer stocks, such as those in the consumer staples sector, tend to be more resilient during economic downturns. This is because they provide essential goods and services that consumers continue to demand, regardless of the economic climate.\n\nThese stocks often offer stability and consistent dividends, making them attractive to risk-averse investors. Consumer discretionary, however, tend to rally when times are good, and the U.S. economy has gone from strength to strength recently.\r\n\r\nThis article will explore more defensive, dividend-based companies, as well as those that deploy capital in the aims of delivering capital appreciation for investors.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), as a consumer staples giant, offers a diverse portfolio of essential household products, including brands like Tide, Gillette and Pampers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nP&G\u2019s products often generate several times more annual revenue than its nearest competitors, thanks to the company\u2019s significant investments in research and development, marketing and artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s size allows it to maintain a competitive edge through leveraging its relationships with retail partners\r\n\r\nThe main reason why investors should consider PG as one of those consumer stocks to buy is due to its strong dividend. P&G\u2019s payout ratio is 60.51%, and it has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years.\n\nPG is one of my favorite consumer discretionary stocks \u2014 it offers good income with low volatility and it has a great mix for conservative investors.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a global fast-food chain that has demonstrated resilience during economic downturns. The company\u2019s strong brand recognition sets it apart, and I feel that its shares have now entered a buying zone.\r\n\r\nThe company plans to introduce more deals, including a $5 meal deal, to address the slowdown in store traffic caused by inflation-weary customers, and its stock price has fallen around 12% year-to-date.\n\nLike PG, MCD is also a low-volatility blue-chip stock that should be worth of investors\u2019 attention. It offers a dividend yield of 2.54%, with a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s payout ratio is 53.84%, and it has increased its dividend for about 16 consecutive years. The company also has a buyback yield of 1.61%.\n\nI believe that MCD could be a great addition to one\u2019s portfolio if investors seek a strong economic moat above all else in the consumer sector.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has expanded into various consumer-related sectors, such as streaming services, grocery delivery.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Amazon\u2019s investments in AI startups like Hugging Face and Anthropic, along with the development of its own AI chips \u2014 Trainium and Inferentia \u2014 and a planned $11 billion investment in data centers, means that it could continue to dominate the e-commerce landscape, as well as make further inroads into the higher margin consumer businesses.\r\n\r\nSome analysts, including chartist Bruce Kamich, are increasingly bullish on AMZN\u2019s future prospects, and I agree with his sentiment. Kamich\u2019s point-and-figure chart calculations suggest price targets of $199 and $223 for Amazon shares. However, he cautions that if the stock trades below $166, the daily price target may weaken.\n\nAMZN\u2019s shares are significantly below their all-time high, and I believe that it will be the big FAANG stocks like AMZN that will be the primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI revolution, of which AMZN has only just started to tap into.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Generally speaking, the most extreme meme stocks should be avoided. These ideas lack fundamental rigor and are therefore subject to catastrophic volatility. However, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to dismiss this unique space as entirely speculative. Some ideas make rational sense.\n\nIndeed, casting aspersions on meme stocks prior to understanding the narrative is about focusing on the messenger rather than the message. With some long-term money to be made, it\u2019s time to consider the legitimate players.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to the website Memestocks.org, the popular coffeehouse Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) ranked as the most popular idea among meme stocks. While I\u2019m not 100% convinced of the upside narrative of SBUX, I can see why retail investors appreciate the idea. It\u2019s a popular brand and with the labor market generally printing robust numbers, SBUX should rise on the broader optimism.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo far, the financial figures appear to support the concept of a continued rise in shares. Over the trailing 12 months (TTM), Starbucks posted net income of $4.16 billion, translating to earnings per share of $3.63. On the top line, the coffeehouse generated sales of $36.53 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are targeting EPS of $3.67, a 2.54% increase from last year\u2019s result of $3.58. On the top line, experts believe sales will hit $37.52 billion, a solid 4.29% increase from last year\u2019s tally of $35.98 billion.\n\nEven better, the high-side estimates call for EPS of $4.20 with a top line of $39.1 billion. Again, thanks to the robust jobs numbers, SBUX can potentially hit these targets. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the meme stocks to consider.\n\nLululemon (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nBased in Canada, Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) falls under the apparel retail sector. Together with its subsidiaries, Lululemon designs, distributes and sells athletic apparel, footwear and accessories under its namesake brand. Generally, the company targets customers who are interested in healthy lifestyle activities such as yoga and running.\n\nPresently, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $435.60 average price target. While that implies a sizable upside swing, LULU ranks among the riskiest ideas for meme stocks. Since the beginning of the year, shares have stumbled badly. However, given the recent uptick in momentum, it\u2019s possible that the apparel giant could make a comeback.\n\nBy the numbers, Lululemon posted net income of $1.55 billion during the TTM period, translating to EPS of $12.20. On the top line, revenue hit $9.62 billion. For the current fiscal year, experts are looking for EPS of $14.44, representing an 18.3% lift from last year\u2019s result of $12.20. Revenue could jump to $10.99 billion, up 14.22% from $9.62 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgain, against the backdrop of a robust labor market, LULU could be one of the meme stocks to gamble on.\n\nAir Lease (AL) a close-up shot of an airplane engine\n\nSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Los Angeles, California, Air Lease (NYSE:AL) works in the industrial space. Specifically, it engages in the purchase and leasing of commercial jet aircraft to airlines worldwide. The company\u2019s clients also include other leasing companies, financial services firms and other investors. Thanks to the concept of travel prioritization, AL appears to be a promising example of meme stocks to speculate on.\n\nDuring the early years of the Covid-19 crisis, the phenomenon of revenge travel materialized. After being cooped up at home during the quarantines, pent-up demand sparked for experiential expenditures. While the acute nature of revenge travel has faded, people are still prioritizing their vacation. That\u2019s good for airliners and in theory, should bode well for AL stock.\n\nFinancially, Air Lease\u2019s TTM net income comes in at $552.07 million, translating to EPS of $4.96. During the same period, revenue hit $2.71 billion. Looking out to the end of the year, covering experts anticipate a 14% dip in EPS to $4.44. However, sales could rise 8% to $2.9 billion.\n\nA little patience could see 2025 EPS reach $5.32 on sales of $3.2 billion. Thus, AL is one of the meme stocks to put on your radar.\n\nGen Digital (GEN) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHailing from Tempe, Arizona, Gen Digital (NASDAQ:GEN) easily ranks among the most relevant meme stocks available. Falling under the infrastructure software space, Gen Digital offers cyber safety solutions for consumers in the U.S. and other key international markets. While the company name might not elicit recognition, its brands do. We\u2019re talking Norton, Avast, Avira, AVG and CCleaner.\n\nWhile everyone loves talking about the dramatic rise in technology and its myriad efficiencies, it also comes with a downside. People are always looking to score an easy buck and thus, nefarious activity has only increased with the broader connectivity. It\u2019s simply vital for consumers and enterprises to protect themselves. So, GEN stock should be on the upswing.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. In the TTM period, the company posted net income of $616 million, translating to EPS of 96 cents. Revenue landed at $3.81 billion. For the current fiscal year, experts believe EPS could hit $2.22, up 131.46% from the prior year. Also, revenue may reach $3.95 billion, up nearly 4%. Thanks to the relevancy, GEN is cynically one of the meme stocks to buy.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. As a fast-food giant, its brand represents American-style capitalism. I\u2019m sure anybody remotely connected to civilization recognizes the Golden Arches logo. Anyways, MCD ranks among the top meme stocks, thanks in part to its business expansion and its consistent dividend payouts.\n\nRight now, MCD offers a yield of 2.58% with a reasonable payout ratio of around 57%. Should the Federal Reserve decide to lower the benchmark interest rate, McDonald\u2019s could become more attractive. Right now, MCD\u2019s yield is okay but nothing special. Frankly, government bonds are competing against the fast-food giant. Take that competition away via lower interest rates and suddenly, McDonald\u2019s looks more intriguing.\n\nFinancially, the company posted net income of $8.6 billion during the TTM period, implying EPS of $11.78. Revenue landed at $25.76 billion. For this year, analysts are targeting EPS of $12.32, implying 6.58% up from last year\u2019s print of $11.56. Sales may hit $26.89 billion, up 5.46%. Amid the uncertainty, MCD ranks among the solid ideas for meme stocks to buy.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company. The company offers mobile app and website that offers people the ability to invest in stocks\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the enterprises that helped spark the fervor in meme stocks, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a name to discuss. On the aforementioned website, HOOD pinged as one of the most memed securities and I believe for good reason. Yes, the intensity of retail investing has died down from the Covid days. That was when seemingly everyone lived out their Gordon Gekko fantasies.\n\nFast forward to 2024, circumstances have changed. However, regular folks are still interested in building wealth through self-directed portfolio activities. After all, we\u2019re talking about meme stocks because the underlying phenomenon once again sparked broader attention. With that, Robinhood\u2019s gamified approach to investing can help attract new users. Also, the labor market being robust helps the business.\n\nIn terms of raw numbers, Robinhood posted net income of $127 million during the TTM period, translating to an EPS of 15 cents. Revenue during the period hit $2.04 billion. For the rest of the year, analysts are targeting EPS of 52 cents, a big swing from last year\u2019s loss of 61 cents. On the top line, sales could rise 32.44% to hit $2.47 billion.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the stunning rise of the broader chip-manufacturing space, it should come as no surprise that Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the meme stocks to buy. Per its corporate profile, the company \u2013 known as TSMC \u2013 manufactures, packages, tests and sells integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor devices. It provides a range of powerful solutions, including wafer fabrication, radio frequency and mixed-signal circuits.\n\nFundamentally, the surge of demand for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) processors \u2013 thanks mostly to artificial intelligence \u2013 should offer a downwind benefit to TSM. In other words, TSM ranks among the meme stocks to buy because of the riding-coattails effect. Nvidia shares a close partnership with TSMC. What\u2019s good for the former should be good for the latter.\n\nFinancially, TSMC posted a net income of $27.2 billion during the TTM period. This translates to an EPS of $5.17. Further, revenue landed at $70.2 billion. Looking out to the rest of the year, analysts project EPS of $6.29, a sizable step from last year\u2019s $5.19. Also, revenue could clock in at $85.06 billion, up 22.6W% from last year\u2019s tally of $69.4 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Oversold Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Investors with a contrarian bent are likely interested in figuring out what are the top oversold stocks to buy. However, it\u2019s reasonable to say that \u201coversold\u201d is in the eye on the beholder.\n\nThat is, as Investopedia explains in its definition, \u201coversold\u201d is a subjective term. There are technical trading tools that can help you identify oversold stocks. Most notably, the Relative Strength Index.\n\nHowever, merely buying every stock with a technically oversold rating (below 50) does not guarantee you will profit in the aggregate. To further whittle down a list of oversold stocks, it\u2019s key to use fundamental analysis to screen out stocks that rapidly moved lower for a good reason.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDoing this will provide a list of stocks that have been unfairly bailed on by investors, and situations where shares have moved too far, too fast, relative to changes (if any) in fundamentals or future prospects. The following seven oversold stocks to buy fall into this category.\n\nArcos Dorados (ARCO) An image of a McDonald's store front with the red and yellow \"M\" logo, advertisements and signs on the windows, and a white, black, red, and yellow Ronald McDonald statue sitting in front.\n\nSource: Ratana21 / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO) is the master franchisee for McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) in most of Latin America and the Caribbean. Shares in the Uruguay-based company, whose name in Spanish translates to \u201cGolden Arches,\u201d has, like MCD stock itself, been pulling back in recent months.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, as I discussed recently, is pulling back due to uncertainty over the impact of macroeconomic challenges. ARCO stock is pulling back for similar reasons. However, a return to growth for Arcos Dorados could arrive far more easily than for its franchisor.\n\nThanks to further organic growth, as well as the expected normalization of macro challenges starting next year, a growth resurgence may be just around the corner. Sell-side forecasts call for earnings per share to rise by around 16.5% during 2025. With this, buying oversold ARCO today, at just 11.5x forward earnings, there is potential for substantial upside.\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) A Build-A-Bear (BBW) storefront in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing a recent post-earnings plunge, Build-A-Bear-Workshop (NYSE:BBW) once again became one of the oversold stocks to buy. On May 30, the specialty retailer reported its latest quarterly results and updated guidance.\n\nWhile Build-A-Bear reiterated guidance, revenue and earnings fell short of forecasts. Yet while it makes sense that BBW stock tanked on this news, it\u2019s not as if uncertainty over the company\u2019s underlying performance was insufficiently baked into its valuation. Shares traded at a low valuation before earnings, and since earnings have fallen back to a forward multiple of just 7.5x.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the guidance reiteration strongly suggests that \u201cbetter than feared\u201d results, or perhaps even \u201cbeat and raise\u201d results, may lie ahead in the coming quarters. This could help get BBW stock on an upward trajectory and enable shares to re-hit recent highs in the low-$30s, or surge to even higher prices.\n\nGlobal Payments (GPN) Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) is another company that has entered oversold territory this earnings season. Shares in the payment processing firm have moved steadily lower since reporting first-quarter results on May 1.\n\nAlthough results came in ahead of forecasts and guidance was reiterated, investors bailed on GPN stock. Perhaps they read too much into comments from CFO Josh Whipple, who stated on the earnings call that the outlook for 2024 \u201ccontinues to reflect the potential for a slightly more tempered economic environment\u201d compared to 2023.\n\nHowever, with the sell-off pushing GPN down to a valuation of just 8.7x forward earnings, the market could quickly realize that it has overreacted. Shares today trade at a steep discount to comparable payment processing companies. Another potential catalyst for Global Payments is a possible sale of its moribund AdvancedMD subsidiary, even if it\u2019s sold for a fire-sale price.\n\nHudson Technologies (HDSN) Graphic of large die that says \"sell,\" \"buy\" and \"do nothing\" on the three sides shown with investor character to the side thinking. Beige graph background with blue line near top. speculative stocks to sell\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/eamesBot\n\nFor many years, Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) was on a tear. Mostly because changing regulations was a boon for the refrigerant reclamation business. More recently, though, sentiment has shifted in a big way.\n\nInvestors are disappointed that the big payoff from this tailwind has taken longer than expected to arrive. HDSN stock is down by more than a third year-to-date. However, following this sell-off, Hudson has become one of the oversold stocks to buy. As Seeking Alpha contributor Ken Taylor argued last month, the market\u2019s impatience makes this stock a strong opportunity.\n\nWhile the company may not be set to hit its prior 2025 growth targets, high growth remains a strong possibility starting two years out. There could also be some silver linings from this delay, such as Hudson\u2019s ability to acquire competitors at more favorable prices. Hence, if you\u2019re a contrarian with a long time horizon, consider HDSN.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Silhouettes of charging electric car and wind turbines. Getting electricity from renewable energy sources. EVs. Electric vehicles. EV stocks.\n\nSource: Scharfsinn / Shutterstock\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) appeared to be making a comeback earlier this year, but in recent months, shares in the China-based hybrid automaker pulled back considerably. Trading for as much as $47.33 per share as recently as March, LI has dropped to the low $20s.\n\nYet while this sell-off has been driven by negative developments such as the continued EV price war in China, a lackluster earnings report, and delays in Li\u2019s launch of fully electric SUV models, LI stock is not just oversold in a technical sense. Shares are value territory as well.\n\nWhy? Even as Li is being affected by the price wars, the company remains profitable. A profitability rebound may arrive next year, as headwinds recede and the company\u2019s pivot to becoming an EV pure play continues. Trading for only 10.6 times estimated 2025 earnings, improved sentiment could drive a massive re-rating.\n\nRemitly Global (RELY) Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMocca\n\nAfter falling by a third since the start of 2024, Remitly Global (NASDAQ:RELY) has become one of the oversold stocks to buy. Yes, on the surface, it makes some sense why investors have given up on shares in this remittance services-focused fintech firm.\n\nWhile not certain, a big reason for the market\u2019s downbeat view on RELY stock may have to do with profitability or the lack thereof. Despite scaling up considerably in recent years, Remitly has yet to become profitable. However, revenue keeps growing at an elevated pace. Last quarter, the company\u2019s top line was up 32%. Adjusted EBITDA also jumped considerably.\n\nForecasts still call for a swing to full-year profitability. From there, Remitly could experience outsized earnings growth, such as an 85.4% increase between 2024 and 2025. If results improve, so too will sentiment, which may result in a strong rebound for RELY.\n\nSun Country Airlines (SNCY) stock image of the interior of a passenger aircraft. Airline stocks are up again.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSome airline stocks have kept climbing lately. Sun Country Airlines (NASDAQ:SNCY) isn\u2019t one of them, unfortunately. Shares in this low-cost carrier have been trending lower for some time. In May alone, SNCY nosedived, falling by around 21% throughout the month.\n\nUnderwhelming quarterly results were a factor in this pullback. As InvestorPlace Earnings reported May 7, Sun Country missed on both revenue and earnings forecasts for the first quarter. However, following this drop, SNCY stock entered oversold territory. All it may take for shares to bounce back is for the airline to report \u201cbetter than feared\u201d results in the coming quarters.\n\nThis could be more than doable. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Chris Markoch recently discussed, Sun\u2019s hybrid passenger, charter and cargo business model may give the carrier flexibility if passenger air travel dips further. Analysts also call for the carrier to experience further growth in 2025, with earnings rising by around 54%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "GameSquare is Making Moves to Become the Dallas Cowboys of Esports",
        "content": "GameSquare (Nasdaq: GAME) has become a leading full-service eSports and gaming agency Services range from game development to competitions to influencer marketing Recently acquitted Faze Clan, which owns many teams and is gaming\u2019s most recognizable name Hired Ninja, gaming\u2019s most popular streamer, as Chief Innovation Officer Board includes Tom Walker, CFO of Dallas Cowboys, world\u2019s most valuable sports team Jones Family Office and Goff Family are two largest shareholders Services include creation of brand-linked game experiences for blue chip companies like Coca-Cola Co. and McDonald\u2019s Corp. Also provides SaaS services to 8 of top 10 gaming publishers including Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Activision Blizzard, Tencent Holdings Expects over $100 million of revenue in 2024 and to become cash-flow positive in near term Valuation of just 0.5 times 2024 sales is sharply below comps such as WPP plc\n\nBy John Jannarone and Jarrett Banks\n\nGameSquare (Nasdaq: GAME), financially and strategically-backed by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, is doubling down on the power of gaming and youth culture.\n\nThe gaming industry will generate an estimated $211 billion in revenue in 2025, with mobile gaming at $116 billion,\u00a0according to Ernst & Young. GameSquare aims to revolutionize the way brands and game publishers connect with hard-to-reach Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and Millennial audiences.\n\nThe platform provides marketing and creative services, data and analytics solutions, and amplifies awareness through competitive gaming group FaZe Clan, previously valued at over $1 billion, and acquired last year for $14 million in an all-stock transaction.\n\nGaneSquare\u2019s talent roster is pivotal in maintaining and growing the brand\u2019s personality and market presence. Similar to Dak Prescott of the Cowboys, Tyler Blevins, better known as Ninja, is the most recognizable name in the industry with over 19 million followers on Twitch, an interactive live-streaming service. As GameSquare\u2019s Chief Innovation Officer, he represents the brand to tell the story to the world.\n\nTyler Blevins, better known as\u00a0Ninja\n\nGameSquare envisions continuous innovation and technological advancement driving the esports sector. AI technology is already playing a crucial role in enhancing live streaming analytics, game development, player performance and fan experience.\n\nHow does GameSquare make money? Starting with recently-acquird FaZe, which owns several teams who play various games, it\u2019s best to think of it as any sports club. Just like the Dallas Cowboys, FaZe has players who are widely followed and compete in high-profile games.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, FaZe participated in the 100th IEM in Dallas, where teams competed for $250,000 in prizes in a tournament in the highly-popular game Counter-Strike. In addition to prize winnings, the players wear sponsored jerseys and fans can buy gear to show support for their favorite teams.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, FaZe has forged partnerships with some of the world\u2019s biggest sports brands. The Nike x FaZe LeBron NXXT Gen was the top selling basketball shoe in the world in March 2023, with a whopping 70,000 units sold.\n\nFaZe\u2019s reach goes far beyond sports apparel. Fans of FaZe literally gobbled up The Totino\u2019s x FaZe Buffalo Chicken Pizza Rolls, which were the top selling co-banded product Totino\u2019s has seen in 10 years.\n\nA second big source of revenue is GameSquare\u2019s full-service creative agency. In essence, the company partners with brands that want to reach a young gaming audience and offers everything from content creation to influencer marketing.\n\nFortnite, for instance, is a game that allows creators to develop their own \u201cworlds\u201d that can be tied directly to consumer brands. The idea is akin to creating content in the metaverse, where players can see and virtually interact with anything from sodas to rollercoasters.\n\nCoca-Cola Co. and Six Flags Entertainment Corp. wanted to create an experience that built off a real-life experience they were hosting, so they partnered with GameSquare to create a game that allowed fans to explore and speed along roller coaster rails. There\u2019s also a McDonald\u2019s world, which GameSquare helped make, called WcDonald\u2019s and aimed at anime enthusiasts.\n\nGameSquare even assisted MasterCard as it advanced a sustainability initiative. The company created a speedrun game that planted trees as players progressed, helping to replenish a forest.\n\nAs part of its agency services, GameSquare can recruit influencers to attract viewers and players. The best example is Ninja, who commands a huge audience and mainly just plays, rather than competes in, games. An influencer like Ninja has incredible power to bring attention to any game he\u2019s promoting. Some clients want specific parts of the offering and others want the whole breadth \u2013 from development to influencer marketing.\n\nGameSquare also helps the world\u2019s biggest video game makers. It provides SaaS solutions to partners including 8 of the top 10 video game publishers, such as Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Activision Blizzard and Tencent Holdings.\n\nAs part of the partnership with investor Jerry Jones, GameSquare is the creative agency of record for the Dallas Cowboys. Last year, they launched Dallas Cowboys Game Time, which is an interactive experience within Fortnite.\n\nThe Cowboys relationship goes much further. The Cowboys, widely considered the world\u2019s most valuable sports franchise at nearly $10 billion, have proven their ability to create value from the team\u2019s popularity. The board of directors includes Tom Walker, who is CFO of both the Cowboys and the Jones Family Office.\n\nGameSquare also has the right mix of leaders at the helm. Lou Schwartz, Chairman and President, is a seasoned tech and digital media executive who helped pioneer internet video management and over-the-top video delivery.

        "content": "If you are worried about the economy and how the market will move from here,\u00a0it is ideal to invest\u00a0in dividend stocks that pay, no matter the market situation.\u00a0When you have dividend aristocrat stocks in your portfolio, you can ensure consistent payouts for years.\u00a0These\u00a0are companies that\u00a0have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years. They\u00a0have enough liquidity to keep doing the same, in rain or shine.\n\nIt is not easy for companies to achieve the status of dividend aristocrats, and given the market situation, some of the best stocks have dipped due to a market pullback.\u00a0This\u00a0is your chance to scoop up the incredibly stable and highly rewarding dividend stocks.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three dividend stocks to buy in the current market pullback.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nA household name, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a beverage and snacks giant with a global presence. The company is no longer just a beverage maker but owns some of the biggest snack brands\u00a0including\u00a0Frito Lay.\u00a0Trading at $171, PEP stock hasn\u2019t shown much\u00a0of a\u00a0movement since the beginning of the year.\n\nIt was trading at the same level in January and has moved sideways over the past few months. The stock dropped 6% in the past 12 months. Therefore, this pullback is your chance to pounce on the dividend aristocrat. Despite beating expectations in the\u00a0first-quarter results, the stock slipped. The core financials improved year-over-year (YOY), and the company reported an organic growth of 2.7% YOY.\n\nWhile the dividend payout ratio has remained stagnant over the past five years, its dividend yield and the dividends per share have increased. It has a yield of 3.14% and pays a quarterly dividend of $1.36 per share per quarter. The dividend aristocrat has raised dividends for over 60 years and has enough cash flow to keep doing so.\n\nMoreover, the current stock pullback is temporary since its growth story isn\u2019t over yet. The international market is expanding, and PepsiCo enjoys healthy profitability.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nHaving raised dividends for 46 consecutive years, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) can ensure steady passive income,\u00a0no matter the\u00a0market situation.\u00a0Trading at $259, MCD stock has dropped 12% year-to-date (YTD). The stock was trading\u00a0very\u00a0close to $300 at the beginning of the year and has\u00a0dropped\u00a0significantly since then. This pullback\u00a0is a chance for\u00a0smart\u00a0investors to load up on the restaurant stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the business has survived several economic uncertainties and reported\u00a0impressive financials\u00a0despite high inflation.\u00a0It saw a 4.6% revenue jump to $6.17 billion, and the EPS came in at $2.70. The EPS came below expectations due to the change in consumer spending.\u00a0This\u00a0has impacted several companies across the industry but could be temporary.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s enjoys a dividend yield of 2.58% and pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67. If you look at the long-term picture, McDonald\u2019s will continue to thrive and\u00a0will\u00a0not disappoint investors. It has aggressive expansion plans and aims to open nearly\u00a010,000 new restaurants\u00a0globally by 2027, to reach\u00a0a total of\u00a050,000 restaurants.\n\nIt\u2019s successful franchise model\u00a0helps keep the cost of operations\u00a0low while ensuring steady royalty income.\u00a0This\u00a0is one stock that\u00a0will continue to reward\u00a0investors,\u00a0no matter where the market moves from here. MCD is one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks to add to your portfolio.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown 8% YTD, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is trading at $147 and is moving near the 52-week low\u00a0which\u00a0is your chance to grab this stock. JNJ is a well-known brand globally, and the company thrives on acquisitions and mergers. Recently, it completed the acquisition of Shockwave Medical, its push into the cardiovascular space.\n\nAlso, this dividend aristocrat has raised annual dividends for 62 consecutive years,\u00a0which\u00a0is one\u00a0of the longest in the healthcare industry.\u00a0An important\u00a0global player, the company has a massive portfolio of healthcare products and Medtech devices\u00a0which\u00a0ensure\u00a0steady revenue growth.\n\nBesides regularly making money from the popular drugs, it has seen growth in the medical devices segment\u00a0which was up\u00a04% YOY in the\u00a0first quarter.\u00a0Yes, the company has reported lackluster performance in the past few years. But this doesn\u2019t mean you can write it off.\u00a0It is a highly specialized pure-play pharmaceutical company and one of the best dividend stocks to own.\n\nAny pullback in Johnson & Johnson is a chance for you to snag the stock. It will keep rewarding shareholders for years to come and has managed to\u00a0grow,\u00a0despite several economic ups and downs. The company operates in an industry that will\u00a0always\u00a0keep growing, and innovation is the key to its success. With Johnson & Johnson, you can expect slow and steady growth over the years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the latest market close, McDonald's (MCD) reached $259.75, with a +0.33% movement compared to the previous day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.11%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.56%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had lost 4.23% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 3.26% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.06% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of McDonald's will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.10, down 2.21% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $6.69 billion, indicating a 2.89% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $12.17 per share and revenue of $26.62 billion, indicating changes of +1.93% and +4.41%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for McDonald's. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.2% downward. McDonald's is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nInvestors should also note McDonald's's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 21.27. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 18.95, which means McDonald's is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nWe can also see that MCD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.92. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Retail - Restaurants industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.75.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 163, this industry ranks in the bottom 36% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

DLTR, Walmart WMT, Dollar General DG, McDonald's MCD and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW.\n\n3 Oversold S&P 500 Stocks Down at Least 15% to Buy in June\n\nThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell again on Thursday, driven lower by huge pullbacks across software stocks, spurred by Salesforce's 20% selloff.\n\nThe market needed a cooldown and Wall Street decided it was time to take profits ahead of the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge on Friday morning. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are still riding high heading into June.\n\nThere could be more near-term profit-taking, with plenty of large-cap stocks up well over 30% YTD. Investors should start focusing on taking advantage of any moves down to key moving averages such as the 21-day or 50-day.\n\nWall Street is also likely starting to look for deals as investors take some AI-focused winnings off the table and look to put money to work in beaten-down areas that offer near-term and long-term upside.\n\nToday's episode of Full Court Finance digs into a few reasons behind the recent market dip to close out May. We then explore three oversold S&P 500 stocks that are down at least 15% in 2024 that investors might want to buy right now.\n\nDollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThe ultra-discount retailer has been hit hard as inflation-squeezed lower-income consumers pull back on spending. Dollar Tree said earlier this year that it would close around 600 unprofitable Family Dollar stores in the first half of FY24 and close 370 Family Dollar and 30 Dollar Tree stores over the next several years at the end of each store's current lease term.\n\nDLTR is also being hit by theft, lower SNAP benefits, higher gas spending, student-debt repayments restarting, and other headwinds. Dollar Tree stock is down 20% YTD and trading 35% below its peaks because of the changing consumer environment's impact on its earnings outlook.\n\nDollar Tree has already been punished for its downward EPS revisions, which appear to be leveling off recently. DLTR is still expected to grow its adjusted earnings by 17% in FY24 and 18% next year on 2.5% and 6%, respective revenue expansion.\n\nDollar Tree shares have soared 1,100% in the past 20 years to blow away Walmart's 250% and Dollar General's 450%. DLTR appears to be finding support near its 50-month moving average\u2014a level it hasn't traded below for long over the past two decades.\n\nDLTR is sitting at historically oversold RSI levels. Valuation wise, Dollar Tree is trading 34% below its highs and 15% below its median at 15.6X forward earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDollar Tree reports its first quarter results on Wednesday, June 5.\n\nMcDonald's\n\nThe burger giant, like Dollar Tree, is getting stung by slowing spending from lower-income consumers. McDonald's also said in its Q1 release that the \"continued impact of the war in the Middle East more than offset positive comparable sales in Japan, Latin America and Europe.\" McDonald's is now laser focused on rolling out deals to attract consumers this summer.\n\nMcDonald's is still projected to grow its global comparable sales by 2.3% in 2024. This marks a slowdown from three straight years of booming comps expansion, including a 9% surge last year.\n\nMCD is projected to grow its revenue by over 4% in 2024 and 6% next year to boost adjusted earnings by 2% and 8%, respectively. This bottom-line growth follows 18% adjusted EPS expansion last year. Despite its recent downward EPS revision, MCD's consensus estimates for 2024 and 2025 remain above where they were this time last year.\n\nMcDonald's has slipped 15% YTD and it trades 27% below its average Zacks price target. The fast-food powerhouse appears to be finding support at its 50-month moving average, a level it hasn't fallen below during the last 20 years.\n\nMCD is historically oversold and trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple during the last five years outside of the Covid selloff. McDonald's is also an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat that's yielding 2.7% right now.\n\nLamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nLamb Weston's frozen potatoes business is boring but booming. Yet the stock has tanked 21% YTD after it missed our Q3 2024 EPS estimates and slashed its guidance as it faces setbacks amid its transitions to a new planning system.\n\n\"The enterprise resource planning (ERP) transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders... While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition's effect on the quarter,\" CEO Tom Werner said in its quarterly release.\n\nLamb Weston believes the impact is in the rearview as its \"order fulfillment rates have normalized.\" The company's earnings outlook has fallen recently, but its outlook for FY24 and FY25 remain solidly above where they were this time last year. LW is projected to grow its sales by 23% in FY24 and add another 3% next year to boost its bottom line by 18% and 12%, respectively.\n\nLamb Weston is down 21% YTD and trades 31% below its average Zacks price target. LW is still up 45% in the last five years to blow away the Zacks Consumer Staples sector's sideways run.\n\nLW found support at its 200-week moving average. Plus it trades at a 56% discount to its highs and near its all-time Covid lows at 13.8X forward earnings. Lamb Weston also pays a dividend that yields 1.7%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Despite covering relatively few stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is often considered\u00a0a bellwether. Its 30 components have experienced significant change, and even though many slow-growth stocks remain in the index, it also includes many of today's largest and most dynamic companies.\n\nThis means some of the companies in the Dow will continue to fly high. If you want exposure to the Dow and the potential for significant growth, these stocks could serve you well over time.\n\nAmazon\n\nIndeed, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.9 trillion market cap makes growth challenging. It means that it must generate more revenue and profit than much smaller companies to achieve the same percentage growth rates.\n\nHowever, Amazon has found a unique workaround. Its online sales business, which accounts for its largest revenue source, is a low-margin business supporting smaller, more dynamic enterprises. That includes advertising, subscriptions, and third-party seller services.\n\nMoreover, Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, made up $25 billion of Amazon's $143 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2024. Nonetheless, thanks to its higher operating margin, it accounted for $9.4 billion of Amazon's over $15 billion in operating income.\n\nThe AWS segment gives it a much smaller base by which it can grow profits faster. Indeed, the $10 billion in Q1 net income rose 225% from year-ago levels. That increase likely contributed to Amazon's near-60% stock price surge over the last year.\n\nFurthermore, while the triple-digit profit growth is probably not sustainable, it makes its 51 price-to-earnings ratio, a level near multi-year lows, appear inexpensive. Such conditions should bolster Amazon's growth despite its size and stability.\n\nVisa\n\nDespite its massive size, Visa (NYSE: V) holds tremendous growth potential. Its global payments network continues to play a more critical role in the economy as society becomes more cashless.\n\nIt remains a leading (or arguably dominant) service provider with its credit and debit cards and merchant terminals. In 2023, 61% of all credit cards in the U.S. came from Visa. This was far ahead of Mastercard at 25% and American Express at 11%. Card Brand Market Share in the U.S., 2007-2023\n\nConsidering the volume of global transactions, it adds up to a staggering amount of gross payment volume, and from that, Visa collects a small fee.\n\nHowever, its largest revenue source is data processing fees. That involves services such as clearing, settlement, network access, and other related services. International transaction fees and other services make up the remainder of its revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fiscal Q2 (ended March 31), Visa reported $8.8 billion in revenue, 10% above year-ago levels. Likewise, its $4.7 billion in net income also rose 10%.\n\nThis growth helped take the consumer finance stock more than 20% higher over the last year. Also, its P/E ratio of 31 is below the average multiple of 35 for the last five years, a factor that could attract more buyers. Given industry trends, Visa's march higher should continue for a long time to come.\n\nMcDonald's\n\nAdmittedly, investors may not look favorably at McDonald's(NYSE: MCD), given concerns over rising prices and wages. Media reports of the feared \"$20 happy meal\" may have contributed to the restaurant stock moving into correction territory.\n\nHowever, a $20 happy meal is not likely to happen anytime soon. Even if it were, McDonald's business model insulates it from those effects. Most of the company's high-margin revenue comes from building rentals and franchise fees -- fixed amounts that do not vary with sales. Also, the 4% to 5% of gross sales due to the company presumably rises with inflation, which mitigates the effects of rising prices.\n\nIndeed, the financials continue to trend higher. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue of $6.2 billion rose 5% compared with year-ago levels. With that increase, the company earned over $1.9 billion, a 7% yearly increase.\n\nAdditionally, investors should not forget the $6.68-per-share annual dividend. Its 2.6% dividend yield is around double the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. More importantly, it has risen yearly since McDonald's introduced the dividend in 1976. That rising return makes it more of a hold, particularly for longtime shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, its P/E ratio of 22 is below the five-year average of 28, allowing prospective shareholders to buy at a discount. As investors recognize that the rising prices are unlikely to derail McDonald's, they will likely have a more bullish outlook on the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIt is never a good thing when execs from a multibillion-dollar consumer name start getting into arguments on the internet. Even if they\u2019re right.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s found itself in the spotlight this week as a casualty of its own prices when news of a (real) $18 Big Mac meal sent social media into overdrive, the high price for a reputed low-cost fast food chain blowing minds.\n\nAnd true to form, fact-free \u201cinformation\u201d about inflation stoked the flames. Even the House Republicans\u2019 X account got in on it, joining the growing chorus claiming Big Mac prices have doubled since the pandemic.\n\nWith inflation throwing so many prices in flux, it seems nobody knows how much anything costs anymore.\n\nThe Big Mac moment precipitated a swift expeditionary force of corrective \u201cactuallys\u201d from financial commentators and the company itself.\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Big Mac prices are up 21% on average since 2019, less than inflation\u2019s 23% and food inflation\u2019s 28%. And wages for nonsupervisory workers are up 28%, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman pointed out, suggesting that, in real wage terms, shelling out for a burger hurts less.\n\nOur Chart of the Week shows it all \u2014 the real data.\n\nBut the most important \u201cactually\u201d came from the chain\u2019s US president, Joe Erlinger.\n\n\u201cIt frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold \u2014 even if it was at one location in the US out of more than 13,700,\u201d Erlinger wrote in an open letter.\n\n\u201cMore worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019,\u201d the executive added, noting the company \u201cmust remain laser-focused on value and affordability.\u201d\n\nTo investors, the appearance of the letter itself may have a whiff of desperation and defensiveness. And this after the company\u2019s results last month disappointed investors as its customers spent and visited less.\n\nA look at its stock chart shows why.\n\nThe stock is only up 28% over the past five years, merely in line with many of its customers\u2019 raises. It\u2019s a paltry gain next to the S&P 500\u2019s 90% return, which we left off the chart as it\u2019d change the chart\u2019s scale by nearly an order of magnitude.\n\nThe $18 Big Mac tweet showing a view count approaching half a million may also be another example of the Streisand effect, drawing copious attention to a literal nothingburger.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Erlinger is clearly worried that the company\u2019s current situation is delicate, and social media chatter about McDonald\u2019s not being affordable sprung its team into action.\n\nWith its jingles, Dollar Menu, Value Meals, clown, and Billions Served, McDonald\u2019s has always been a marketing company as much as a burger chain.\n\nAnd despite this odd open letter on the investor relations page, it\u2019s hard not to imagine the company will get the message out to its actual customers. We\u2019ll see in a quarter\u2019s time if it makes a difference.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "content": "Should June bring forth even more market volatility, long-term value investors may finally have more opportunity to buy. As impressive as this market rally has been, it\u2019s been somewhat tougher for new money to justify getting in at close to new highs. With some pundits calling for a market correction (a 10% drop), it seems wise to wait. But by doing so, you may be overlooking oversold blue-chip stocks that are deals right now.\n\nSome large-cap stocks are now quite oversold, and even a market-wide correction may not nudge them to be markedly lower. In any case, investors should not time the market and instead take the stock market for what it is: a market of stocks.\n\nLet\u2019s look at three hard-hit, oversold blue-chip stocks that could be prime rebound candidates in the second half. Call them \u201cblue-chip boomerangs,\u201d if you will.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and most quick-serve restaurant companies have been feeling a weight on their shoulders lately. Price hikes and negative press have curtailed demand for quick and easy fast-food meals. Recently, McDonald\u2019s received public flack for increasing price increases by close to 40% for your average menu item over the last five years.\n\nEven the most loyal consumers feel that the fast-food juggernaut has overextended itself in price. For now, they\u2019re not \u201clovin\u2019 it,\u201d they\u2019ll probably eat elsewhere until McDonald\u2019s can bring back affordable food. The $5 meal deal, which lands in June, is fantastic, but it won\u2019t be sticking around for long.\n\nThe big question is, what happens after the promotion goes bye-bye? Will customers stick around once the days of $5 meals are gone?\n\nThere\u2019s a high chance of that. McDonald\u2019s needs something more permanent on the value menu, even if such deals make franchisees sweat. After the 16% plunge-off highs, MCD stock goes for 21.4 times, trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) to go with a 2.68% dividend yield. At this juncture, it looks like the stock has a better value than the $5 meal.\n\nLululemon (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nFrom fast food to fast fashion, we have Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), fresh off one of its worst sell-offs in years. Fashion trends have shifted as we inch closer to the decade\u2019s midpoint. And though leggings and gym-appropriate attire could return to style by year\u2019s end, I certainly would not get my hopes up.\n\nIn any case, the athleisure company is committed to changing with the fashion tides. Baggy, relaxed-fit clothing is in, and skintight leggings are on their way out, at least outside a gym setting. The company\u2019s new line of relaxed-fit products may better fit what consumers want on the style front for 2024. Such products may just be able to give LULU stock the lift it needs after a disastrous first half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nEither way, Lululemon seems to have boxed itself in as an athletic apparel maker. It\u2019s harder to break out of athletic apparel, especially given the brand\u2019s heavy focus on the yoga crowd. Aside from the athleisure industry\u2019s recent struggles, Lululemon faces a new wave of competitors that further complicates the path to recovery as it\u2019s forced to play some defense for a change.\n\nThe stock looks somewhat enticing at 24.8 times trailing P/E. If the next quarter is better than feared, it may be time to jump into LULU stock to play a second-half comeback.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is another athletic apparel firm that\u2019s felt the heat in recent quarters. I attribute much of Nike\u2019s recent underperformance to the state of the macro environment. Shoes, a discretionary good, do not sell well when one\u2019s grocery bill swells to become overwhelming.\n\nThough a lack of innovative offerings before 2024 may also be to blame for Nike\u2019s slump, I view NKE stock\u2019s biggest woes as mostly outside its control. Consumers are starved for good deals after getting gouged by inflation for the past three years.\n\nAs you may know, Nike sneakers are not cheap. You\u2019ll pay up to dawn the swoosh! Until Nike gets more aggressive with what it puts on the discount rack, I view Nike\u2019s sneaker rivals as having the edge.\n\nAt writing, NKE stock is down more than 47% from its 2021 all-time high. At 27.4 times trailing P/E, the king of sneakers is incredibly cheap. While I\u2019m unsure when the masses will start repurchasing Nike\u2019s newest wears, I would be inclined to buy the stock at close to multi-year lows for the brand power alone as we step foot into a world where inflation is at a tame 2% or so.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of McDonald\u2019s.

One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver half a decade, McDonald's managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.4% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 4% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think McDonald's will grow revenue in the future.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of McDonald's, it has a TSR of 37% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nMcDonald's shareholders are down 12% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 23%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

        "content": "Not So Happy Meal: McDonald's Menu Price Has Increased By More Than 100%, Some More Than 200% In The Past Decade\n\nIt appears that the iconic fast food chain, known for its Golden Arches, is no longer offering Happy Meals and has faced criticisms from customers due to its price increases. Here's what you need to know:\n\nSince the first McDonald's opened in the 1940s, customers across America and eventually around the globe have enjoyed the iconic burgers and Happy Meals. For decades the burger chain has been known for its affordable prices. However, over the past decade, the menu has seen historic price increases of more than 200% in some cases.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare? Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\nReports of the price increases surfaced on social media, highlighting the impact of inflation on the fast-food giant. Data revealed that five of McDonald's most popular items experienced a staggering increase of 141.4%. For example, at the end of 2019, one medium serving of French fries cost $1.79, and by mid-2024, the price surged to $4.19, which is a 134.1% increase. Some popular items experienced an even more staggering increase of over 200%. These included the McChicken, which went from $1.29 to $3.89 (201.6%) and the classic cheeseburger, which increased from $1.00 to $3.15 (215%).\n\nSimilarly, the iconic Big Mac meal also surged from $3.99 at the end of 2019 to $7.49 by mid-2024, reflecting an 87.7% price increase. Earlier in the year, a Connecticut-based McDonald's faced consumer anger over its \"outrageous pricing.\" The outlet was charging $17.59 for a Big Mac meal, citing rising labor costs, insurance, and equipment as the culprits.\n\nAnother study conducted by FinanceBuzz also found that the fast-food chain has been increasing menu prices by eye-watering amounts. The study found that McDonald's was one of 13 restaurants in America that have raised their prices by at least 60% between 2014 and 2024. This is almost double the national rate of inflation of 31%.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nThese reports have reached the fast-food chain, and Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, released an open letter addressing the reports on social media. In his letter, Erlinger has emphasized that the increases are not as drastic as the reports suggest and that there has only been an average increase of 40% in menu items. Erlinger, however, does not shy away from acknowledging that the rising menu prices have indeed put a strain on Americans.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Americans across the country are making tough calls about where to spend their hard-earned money, and while we've been working hard to make sure our fans have great reasons to visit us, it's clear that we, together with our franchisees, must remain laser-focused on value and affordability.\" Wrote Erlinger.\n\nErlinger also addressed the claims of a Connecticut outlet charging $18 for a Big Mac, revealing his frustration at the franchise but stressing that this was the exception and not the rule.\n\nMcDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski has also weighed in on the price increase claims and has admitted that inflation has been the cause of increases and that eating out at the fast-food chain is now a luxury.\n\n\"Eating at home has become more affordable. The battleground is certainly with the low-income consumer,\" said Kempczinski.\n\nErlinger echoes this and attributes the price increases to the rising costs of running a business, \"Inflationary pressures have affected all sectors of the economy, including ours.\"\n\nConsumers in the Golden States have been warned to brace themselves for additional price increases due to California Gov. Gavin Newsom signing a new minimum wage increase for fast food workers to $20 per hour. Minimum wage hikes are expected across the country as well.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAre you rich?

        "title": "Inflation Relief: Which Retail Giants Are Slashing Prices?",
        "content": "The topic of inflation relief is one most consumers can get behind. Inflation has been stickier than many expected, particularly in key categories. Indeed, when we\u2019re talking about essentials such as food and consumer staples, there isn\u2019t much consumers can do. However, a number of companies are seeing this inflationary environment as one that can be beneficial, if there\u2019s room to cut prices.\n\nWe\u2019re now seeing evidence more price cuts are taking hold, as companies look to attract more consumers to shop both online and physically in stores. Generally, the items seeing the most significant price cuts are essentials, frozen goods and other discretionary purchases.\n\nIncreasing prices because of inflation has led to cautious spending from consumers. Many shoppers are now prioritizing needs over wants, setting a tight budget for shopping. This shift has been a challenge for the U.S. economy, which is currently relying heavily on consumer spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInflation is still hovering around 3.4% in March, a 0.3% increase from February, as per data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. NerdWallet says from January 2020 to April 2024, consumer price inflation has totaled close to 20%. For those in the lower income brackets, that\u2019s not a good thing.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s dive into where consumers are seeing the most inflation relief, and from which retailers, right now.\n\nWalgreens\n\nReducing over 1,500 items, including toiletries, snacks and toys, Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) is among the top pharmacy retailers that have announced price slashes.\n\nCompetitors like Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have similarly cut prices. Some items worth looking out for are gummy vitamins and chips now selling for $11.99 and $1.99, respectively.\n\nTracey Brown, Walgreens retail president, said the company decided to support customers under financial strain; hence, the price reductions. After announcing excellent second-quarter sales expectations, WBA lowered its full-year earnings forecast due to a shift in the retail environment.\n\nThe company\u2019s next earnings report is expected in June, but currently, shares are down 40% this year. Walgreens\u2019 recent earnings report showed a 4.5% drop in retail sales and a 4.3% drop in sales year-over-year.\n\nTarget\n\nTarget has rolled out substantial price cuts on approximately 5,000 popular items. Having already slashed prices on 1,500 products, more reductions are in store for the summer, aiming to save consumers millions. Rick Gomez, the executive vice president, emphasized that these cuts, covering essentials such as milk, meat and diapers, reflect Target\u2019s commitment to competitiveness and aiding consumers in managing their budgets.\n\nStory continues\n\nTarget offered lower prices on household essentials, helping consumers save during Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and back-to-school shopping. Examples of these price cuts included Good & Gather frozen chicken breasts and other frozen products. These reductions included Memorial Day discounts to help consumers celebrate the holiday.\n\nThe company reduced prices on national and popular in-house brands like Good & Gather and Everspring in critical departments such as food, household essentials and health products. New prices, marked with red tags, are accessible in-store, online and through the Target app.\n\nExamples include Good & Gather unsalted butter at $3.79 (previously $3.99), Prime Hydration sports drinks at $1.99 (previously $2.19) and Clorox scented wipes at $4.99 (previously $5.79).\n\nAldi\n\nThis summer, Germany-based Aldi cut prices on 250+ items, addressing inflation worries to keep shopping affordable. Dave Rinaldo, Aldi U.S. president, stressed the need for discounts on seasonal essentials like picnic and BBQ items.\n\nAldi announced on May 2 its intention to cut prices, aiming to save customers around $100 million, nearly twice the savings from a similar initiative last year, which amounted to over $60 million.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThese price cuts from retail giants only aim to stimulate spending amidst inflation concerns. Restaurant chains like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) introduced fixed-price meal deals, while Michaels permanently reduced prices on popular items by up to 40%.\n\nDespite an unexpected uptick in consumer confidence in May, lingering uncertainties remain about the impact of these discounts. Retailer bankruptcies peaked last year, but empty storefronts are quickly filled due to limited retail space availability.\n\nGrocery chains face significant profit challenges due to small shifts in transaction volume and purchase quantity. While price reductions offer relief, they follow a substantial 26.6% price hike since 2019, compared to a mere 1.6% increase over the preceding five years.\n\nConsumers continue to feel inflation\u2019s impact, as most still compare current grocery costs to pre-pandemic levels, leading to \u201cregister shock\u201d at checkout. This trend is expected to persist.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "3 Stocks With High Yield Growth For Long-Term Passive Income\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAs a dividend investor, you should earn immediate income and expect it to increase over time. There are two main ways to achieve this: first, maintaining a steady dividend and reinvesting it to acquire more shares, and second, relying on future increases in the companies\u2019 dividend payouts.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three outstanding stocks that are nailing it as dividend players. Two of these companies have raised their dividend by more than 15% over the past five years \u2014 a striking surge that makes these stocks appealing to anyone wishing to invest in fast-expanding dividends.\n\nEli Lilly\n\nDriven by the success of its weight reduction medications, Mounjaro and Zepbound, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has experienced a surge in stock value. Although the company has a varied portfolio with great treatments like Jardiance, the weight loss medications have lately attracted major investor attention.\n\nHowever, a disregarded feature of Eli Lilly\u2019s performance is its remarkable dividend increase. The company\u2019s dividend has increased annually by 15% over the last five years. Eli Lilly is notably stable since it has not cut its dividend since 1986.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s weight reduction medicine portfolio drove a 26% increase in sales in the first quarter of 2024, allowing the business to increase its 2024 projection by $2 billion.\n\nCommenting on the first-quarter results, David A. Ricks, Lilly\u2019s chair and CEO, said, \"Lilly\u2019s first quarter performance reflects solid year-over-year revenue growth with strong sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound.\"\n\n\"Our progress in addressing some of the world\u2019s most significant healthcare challenges has increased demand for our medicines. As we continue to make pipeline investments that position us for future growth, we are rapidly expanding manufacturing capacity to make our incretin medicines available to more patients,\" he added.\n\nAs of May 28, Eli Lilly has more than doubled its investment in its Lebanon, Indiana, manufacturing site, committing an additional $5.3 billion. It brings the company\u2019s total investment in the site to $9 billion, up from $3.7 billion.\n\nVisa\n\nWith an amazing average annual dividend growth rate of 16% over the previous five years, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has the fastest rate of increase among dividend companies.\n\nVisa reported in the second quarter that net income and revenues increased by 10%.\n\nVisa\u2019s overall yield stays below 1%, which makes it less appealing for those looking for quick income even with the fast dividend growth. Still, the company\u2019s strong foundations and the possibility for significant dividend increase over the next decades offer a convincing long-term investment opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's\n\nMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD), a staple in dividend investment portfolios, is navigating a challenging landscape in 2024. The fast-food giant\u2019s stock performance has been relatively flat, contributing to a decline this year. Once a go-to value option, McDonald's is reassessing its strategies to regain appeal.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s plans to bring back its well-liked $5 lunch deal to draw consumers and improve performance. Originally suggested earlier in the year, the idea was dropped, most likely in response to franchisee opposition. However, The corporation has resurrected the campaign, which will run for four weeks in late June.\n\nThis move suggests that McDonald's is poised to win back dissatisfied customers, presenting a compelling case for investment despite the recent downturn. Additionally, McDonald's robust dividend growth is a key consideration for investors. Over the past five years, the company has increased its dividend by an average of 7.6% annually.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Debt Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for McDonald's (MCD). Shares have lost about 9.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is McDonald's due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Q1 Earnings Miss, Revenues Top Estimates\n\nMcDonald's posted first-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same. The top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nChris Kempczinski, president and CEO of McDonald's, said that as consumers increasingly scrutinize every dollar they spend, the company\u2019s commitment is to consistently earn their patronage by providing top-notch dependable value and exceptional service. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024 and beyond, MCD\u2019s focus remains on maximizing the competitive strengths outlined in its Accelerating the Arches strategy and expanding its market share in the quick-service restaurant sector to fuel sustained growth.\n\nEarnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nDuring first-quarter 2024, McDonald's reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.70, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71. However, adjusted earnings increased 2% year over year.\r\n\r\nQuarterly net revenues of $6,169 million beat the consensus mark of $6,168 million. The top line rose 5% year over year.\r\n\r\nAt company-operated restaurants, sales totaled $2.35 billion, up 6% year over year. Sales at franchise-operated restaurants amounted to $3.72 billion and increased 4% year over year. Other revenues rose 6% year over year to $91 million.\n\nComps Details\n\nIn the quarter under discussion, global comps expanded 1.9% compared with 12.6% in the prior-year quarter. The company\u2019s comps increased for the 13th quarter in a row.\n\nStrong Comps Across Segments\n\nU.S.: During the first quarter, segmental comps rose 2.5% compared with 12.6% a year ago. Comparable sales saw a boost due to increased average checks resulting from strategic menu price adjustments. Strong execution at the restaurant level, impactful marketing initiatives highlighting the core menu offerings, and ongoing growth in digital and delivery services played a role in driving strong comparable sales.\r\n\r\nInternational Operated Markets: Segmental comps increased 2.7% compared with 12.6% in the year-ago quarter. Strong comparable sales in Germany and the U.K. resulted in the uptick.\r\n\r\nInternational Developmental Licensed Segment: Segmental comparable sales registered a 0.2% decline against 12.6% growth in the prior-year quarter. Despite positive comparable sales in Japan, Latin America and Europe, the ongoing effects of the Middle East conflict outweighed the gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Highlights & Expenses\n\nDuring the first quarter, McDonald\u2019s total operating costs and expenses were $3.43 billion, up 2% year over year.\r\n\r\nOperating income rose 8% year over year to $2.73 billion. Net income totaled $1.92 billion, up 7% year over year.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, McDonald's has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, McDonald's has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has A McDonald's 'Gold Card' That Gives Him Free Food For Life Worldwide\n\nFew perks in fast food are as elusive and sought-after as the McDonald's Gold Card, which grants its holder free meals. However, the benefits of these cards can vary. While some are limited to local venues, others, like the one Bill Gates has, allow him to eat for free at any McDonald's globally.\n\nWarren Buffett, another notable recipient of this privilege, discussed his own McDonald's Gold Card during a 2007 CNBC interview, revealing the more localized nature of his card.\n\nDuring an interview with Becky Quck, Buffett showed what was in his wallet. \"And, ah, here we have my McDonald's card which lets me eat free at any McDonald's in Omaha for the rest of my life. So that's why the Buffett family has Christmas dinner at McDonald's. It explains a lot of things,\" Buffett chuckled.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare? Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\nHe added that while his card is restricted to Omaha, Gates' card is good worldwide. \"There's just a few of them. Bill Gates has one. His is good throughout the world, I guess. Mine is only good in Omaha, but I never leave Omaha so mine is just as good as his,\" he explained.\n\nDespite the vast difference in the geographical scope of their cards, the idea behind them remains a testament to McDonald's appreciation of these individuals. Gates, with a net worth that could easily cover any meal, and Buffett, known for his frugal lifestyle despite his immense wealth, enjoy the simplicity and convenience of the fast-food giant.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nThe exact number of McDonald's Gold cardholders is not publicly known, and the company keeps a tight lid on who else might be part of this exclusive club. Rumors suggest that other celebrities and business magnates may also have these cards, each tailored to the holder's lifestyle and preferences.\n\nIn 2022, McDonald\u2019s tapped into the hype surrounding its mysterious Gold Card by offering a contest that turned the legend into reality for a few non-billionaires. \"Our fans have been fascinated by the lore of the McGold Card and if it really exists,\" said Tariq Hassan, McDonald\u2019s USA chief marketing and customer experience officer. The contest awarded a few lucky winners the ultimate holiday gift \u2014 a McGold Card to share with family and friends.\n\nStory continues\n\nGates\u2019 current net worth is estimated at around $124.1 billion, making him the 7th richest person globally. In a recent blog post, Gates expressed his love for cheeseburgers, calling them his \"favorite food.\" Even with all the wealth in the world, sometimes the most incredible luxury is a simple cheeseburger.\n\nAnd for Bill Gates, that cheeseburger can be enjoyed anywhere in the world, on the house.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nAre you rich?

        "title": "Blue-Chip Bubble Trouble: 7 Stocks to Short as Valuations Stretch to the Limit",
        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering which overvalued blue-chip stocks to ditch right now, look no further. The best investors pay attention to a stock\u2019s valuation. Warren Buffett famously avoids buying stocks that are trading at more than 15 times future earnings estimates. Any stock with a higher multiple is too expensive for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett\u2019s most recent stock purchase, Swiss insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB), is trading at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11 times future earnings forecasts.\n\nWithin the benchmark S&P 500 index, the average P/E ratio is currently just over 27, having risen along with the bull market that began 18 months ago. Stocks are compared to the average multiple to determine whether they are expensive relative to their peers. Some stocks justify a high valuation due to their strong earnings growth and share price appreciation. Others are dangerously overvalued and destined for a correction.\n\nHere is blue-chip bubble trouble: seven stocks to short as valuations stretch to the limit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) have performed well, rising 120% in the past 12 months, including a 40% gain on the year. In the last five years, CRWD stock has increased 444%. While the share price appreciation has been impressive, the growth has made CrowdStrike a very expensive stock to own. The company\u2019s shares are currently trading at 950 times future earnings estimates.\n\nSome investors might feel the premium valuation is justified as CrowdStrike continues to grow at a brisk clip. CRWD stock rose 23% in one day during March after the company reported fourth quarter 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forward guidance. On an earnings call, management reiterated their goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has been one of the best performing cybersecurity stocks, there\u2019s no denying that the shares are expensive right now. The company next reports earnings on June 4.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nData analytics company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is also richly valued, trading at 165 times future earnings forecasts. Like CrowdStrike, Palantir stock has been a strong performer, rising 43% in the past year and climbing 26% so far in 2024. However, the valuation on PLTR stock is starting to look stretched with the shares trading at such a high multiple relative to earnings expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Denver, Colorado-based company recently reported EPS of 8 cents, yet its stock is trading at nearly $21 a share. While the company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters, analysts are raising concerns about the lofty valuation. The high P/E ratio is the main reason why there is a consensus \u201chold\u201d rating on Palantir stock among 12 Wall Street analysts who cover the company.\n\nPalantir builds artificial intelligence (AI) software for governments and corporations, and its stock looks to have gotten caught up in the AI trade this year, pushing up the valuation.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAhead of its upcoming 50-for-1 stock split, one of the biggest in market history, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is trading at a lofty valuation for a quick service restaurant chain. Currently, CMG stock is trading at 67 times future earnings forecasts. That compares to a valuation of 21 times earnings estimates for rival McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). Not only does Chipotle have a high valuation but its share price is out of reach for many investors trading at more than $3,100.\n\nThe stock split is meant to help with the affordability of Chipotle\u2019s shares. However, the valuation is likely to remain rich as investors pay a premium to own the fast-growing restaurant chain that specializes in Mexican cuisine. CMG stock has grown 52% in the last 12 months, bringing its five-year growth rate to 375%. Chipotle has been one of the best-performing stocks to own in the restaurant sector.\n\nWhile CMG stock has been rallying leading up to the stock split on June 26, there could be a selloff after the split is executed. Investors should proceed with caution.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBelieve it or not, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are more expensive currently than archrival Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. AMD stock is trading at a P/E multiple of 247. That compares to 65 times forward earnings estimates for NVDA stock. Of course, Nvidia just reported that its profit rose more than 600% in the first quarter from a year earlier.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has gained the high valuation partly from its own earnings growth, and also because of lofty expectations for the company\u2019s new AI microchips. AMD is seen as the main challenger to Nvidia in the fast-growing market for AI chips and semiconductors, where global demand is exploding. In the last 12 months, the share price of AMD has increased 36%. Through five years, the stock is up 523%.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Robinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) have exploded over the last year as a bull market in both stocks and cryptocurrencies has investors trading more. In the past 12 months, HOOD stock has gained 127%, outpacing most other equities. The rocketing share price has pushed Robinhood Markets\u2019 P/E ratio sky-high. It\u2019s at a point where Robinhood stock is trading at 141 times future earnings.\n\nThe pricey valuation comes as investors cheer the brokerage and its financial results. On the back of strong trading activity, Robinhood recently reported record first-quarter financial results. The company singled out crypto trading on its platform as being largely responsible for its strong financial results. Cryptocurrency transaction revenue more than tripled in Q1 from a year earlier. In the last month alone, HOOD stock has risen 17%.\n\nEli Lilly And Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) has a big catalyst with its weight loss drug Zepbound. Robust sales of the weight loss medication have powered Eli Lilly\u2019s sales and stock to new heights in recent months. In the past year, LLY stock has climbed nearly 90% higher. That brings the stock\u2019s five-year appreciation to almost 600%. The sharp rise in the share price has led to a significant increase in the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nCurrently, LLY stock is trading at 118 time earnings estimates. That compares to a P/E ratio of less than 10 for rival Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) stock. Pharmaceutical stocks are known for having low P/E multiples. This begs the question of whether the valuation of Eli Lilly\u2019s stock is justified? Analysts seem to feel it is given that Zepbound is expected to post sales of more than $1 billion in its first year on the market, and it could become the biggest-selling drug of all time.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO), the leading credit scoring agency in the U.S., has been a consistent, long-term winner for investors. FICO stock has risen 22% this year, 75% over the last 12 months, and 367% in the past five years. The company\u2019s near monopoly on credit scoring services in the U.S. has led to consistently strong earnings growth and a stock that seemingly always rises. But that growth has made Fair Isaac\u2019s stock expensive.\n\nToday, FICO stock is trading at 72 times future earnings estimates. While the Bozeman, Montana-based company has a market capitalization of $34 billion, it is currently trading at a higher multiple than most of the Magnificent 7 mega-cap tech stocks that have market caps above $1 trillion. There\u2019s no question that shareholders pay a premium to own Fair Isaac stock. But the company\u2019s growth and competitive position in the marketplace help account for the rich valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, LLY and FICO. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "Investors typically turn to blue-chip stocks for safe investments that provide safe returns through higher-than-average dividends. Some blue-chip stocks are top-rated and among the world\u2019s most well-known companies. However, their stock prices can sometimes become overinflated despite less-than-ideal performances.\n\nWhile these three blue-chip stocks have seen success in the past, they\u2019re underperforming right now due. Reasons are due to high interest rates and poor management decisions. It may be time to let them go. One bad earnings report doesn\u2019t mean the end of the world, especially for blue-chip stocks. But it is hard to explain or see a turnaround in the near future.\n\nLet\u2019s examine these companies\u2019 most recent earnings and the difficulties they face. We will also look at the underlying reasons that concern the future of these blue-chip stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHershey (HSY) Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden table\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/VG Foto\n\nOne of the most famous chocolate companies ever, Hershey (NYSE:HSY), has been a top blue-chip stock for a long time. Many investors have found a safe investment with Hershey and enjoyed its stable growth for many years. However, after the end of last year, when the company reported a weak outlook for 2024, the stock began to drop.\n\nDespite an earnings beat in Hershey\u2019s most recent earnings report, investors are becoming concerned about the disappointingly flat guidance for 2024. Hershey\u2019s outlook for this year includes only a 2% to 3% increase in net sales with a flat 0% increase in earnings per share.\n\nThis flat guidance is especially concerning because of quickly rising prices of cocoa, one of Hershey\u2019s primary commodities. Cocoa has already more than doubled in price per kilogram this year. While Hershey would have to see a considerable jump in sales and revenue to successfully combat the inflating prices of cocoa, flat guidance likely means a further drop in share price.\n\nHershey is by no means a bad stock. However, given the difficulties the company will face in the foreseeable future, it may be better to sell and get out ahead of any Friday drops in value and income.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been one of the most prominent coffee retailers for several years. Due to its continued success and massive market share in the global coffee market, Starbucks has been a top blue-chip stock in its time.\n\nHowever, so far this year, the stock has seen difficulties. And while management is trying to fix the company\u2019s problems, they may not be taking the right approach. Starbucks\u2019s Q2 earnings report shook the world. Global comparable store sales declined by 4%, and net revenue decreased by 2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nA long-term problem for Starbucks has been the relatively high price of the menu items. In fact, its most recent earnings report reflects this business model\u2019s conflict with the modern consumer. The report included a 4% increase in the average ticket and a 7% decrease in the number of transactions In the U.S.\n\nManagement\u2019s solution to this problem is to lower prices through exclusive deals offered on the mobile app. While this may appeal to customers unwilling to spend as much, it could decrease product availability and negatively affect the number of transactions in too-busy stores.\n\nWith lower prices and potentially fewer transactions overall as a result of this move, it is difficult to imagine Starbucks overcoming declining sales in the near future. Although this historic blue-chip stock is priced cheaper than ever, the price will likely move down.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has been a top blue-chip stock for almost as long as the stock has been traded. The fast food giant is adapting well to current economic conditions and has proven its resiliency to inflation with successful price hikes in recent years.\n\nThe proportional price increase has kept McDonald\u2019s alive in this inflated economy\u2014at least until now. McDonald\u2019s most recent earnings report gives investors reason to worry that prices are becoming too high to appeal to consumers\u2019 limited spending power. Adjusted earnings per share missed analyst estimates, while global comparable store sales only grew 3.4%.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has maintained steady sales growth for over 10 years. But this most recent slowdown may invoke concern. While MCD sales slow, rising inflation does not. The likely decline for McDonald\u2019s in the near future is the now unreasonable, extremely high stock valuation.\n\nWith these factors in mind, McDonald\u2019s is overvalued. Therefore, it may not be worth holding until it finds an alternative method to overcome economic pressure.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Recently, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has been in the headlines, bringing attention to potential market risks. One major risk is stubborn inflation that causes higher for longer rates or, even worse, forces the Federal Reserve to reverse policy and return to rate hikes.\n\nAnother risk that the market is currently ignoring is the volatile geopolitical landscape. The Russia-Ukraine war can escalate at any time and spill over to the rest of Europe, drawing the U.S. into the conflict.

These recession-proof blue-chip stocks to hold can help you weather any economic weakness.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the largest global retailer by revenue, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is built to outperform in a recessionary environment. After all, regardless of the economic situation, people must eat and need household essentials.\n\nStructurally, Walmart can grow sales even in a recession since its revenues are highly geared towards necessities, especially groceries. Today, groceries account for 58.8% of total sales in the U.S. Therefore, the retailer has sales stability even in volatile times.\n\nAnother characteristic that makes Walmart one of the top blue-chip stocks to hold is its everyday low-price strategy. Essentially, it focuses on offering customers value. Its immense scale as the largest global retailer further enhances this advantage. Thus, it can leverage its economies of scale to provide the lowest prices compared to competitors such as Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nRecent quarterly results highlighted this advantage as Walmart exceeded estimates while Target disappointed. Management highlighted that they benefited from more value shoppers as budgets shrink due to persistent inflation and falling pandemic savings.\n\nWalmart\u2019s value proposition lies in its lower prices and broad selection. This formula worked in 2008 and 2009 when the company grew sales during the Great Financial Crisis. It\u2019s the perfect recession-resistant stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is among the blue-chip stocks to hold through a recession. This fast-food giant can minimize your drawdown during a downturn.\n\nThe restaurant sees robust sales during recessions because it is synonymous with budget meals. Typically, consumers drop expensive chains, opting for cheaper meals. The value menu enables the chain to profit at the expense of more expensive chains.\n\nIndeed, McDonald\u2019s is committed to always serving the low-income consumer. Even when times are good it focuses on its budget customers. It\u2019s no surprise that the company is currently planning to launch a $5 value meal. This deal comes amidst a pullback in restaurant traffic across various chains.\n\nValue and affordability have always been core features of Golden Arches. With over 40,000 restaurants globally, it has the scale and capacity to drive affordability to an extent that few chains can. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the perfect answer for a budget-constrained consumer.\n\nAfter dropping from $300 to below $260, this recession-resistant blue-chip stock is back in value territory. Buy shares here at 19 times forward earnings for market-beating returns throughout the economic cycle.\n\nAutoZone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nLastly, another recession-resistant industry is auto parts retailers. It\u2019s no secret that during recessions, new car sales decline due to constrained budgets and job losses. As a result, consumers drive their older cars for longer, which necessitates more repairs due to wear and tear.\n\nDue to this dynamic, auto parts retailers like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and peer O\u2019Reilly Automotive (NYSE:ORLY) managed to grow domestic same-store sales during the Great Financial Crisis. AutoZone grew domestic same-store sales in 2008 and 2009 by 0.4% and 4.4%, respectively. As a result, revenues grew 5.7% and 4.5%.\n\nThe ability to grow sales in one of the greatest recessions reinforces why AutoZone is one of the best blue-chip stocks to hold. Today, it operates 6,300 stores in the U.S., 740 in Mexico and 100 in Brazil. These stores sell an extensive range of automotive and non-automotive parts for cars, vans, sport utility vehicles and light-duty trucks.\n\nMoreover, over the years, management has proved to be a great steward of capital. They have consistently returned free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. Since FY2014, it has reduced its share count by almost half, from 33.9 million to under 18 million shares.\n\nWeaker economic conditions mean more sales for auto parts retailers as customers own their vehicles for longer. AZO stock is a bargain at 17 times forward earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Waylon Cunningham\n\n(Reuters) - McDonald's top U.S. executive denounced viral reports of runaway Big Mac prices as painting an inaccurate picture of the company, which has seen its profits surge by roughly a third since 2019 and is now preparing to roll out $5 combo meals.\n\n\"I can tell you that it frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold,\" said McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger in an open letter published on the burger giant's website on Wednesday.\n\n\"More worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMcDonald's profits have increased by almost a third between 2019 and 2023. McDonald's gross profit in 2023 was slightly more than $14.56 billion. In 2019, it was nearly $11.18 billion.\n\nMcDonald's has in recent months emphasized itself as a value brand. This month the company confirmed it would roll out a $5 combo meal for a limited time this summer.\n\nPrices at McDonald's are set by franchisees, which run 95% of the company's more than 13,700 stores in the U.S., according to the company. The $18 Big Mac, widely reported in the media, was sold at a franchised store in Darien, Connecticut, a town where the median household income is more than $250,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures from 2021.\n\nErlinger said the average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. is $5.29, up 21% since 2019, as opposed to far larger increases suggested by \"poorly sourced\" reports.\n\nAn infographic accompanying the letter cited \"myths\" attributed to, among others, social media posts and an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper.\n\nErlinger said McDonald's built its brand on affordability and is \"committed to living up to that legacy -- especially at a time when our customers need it most.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's and other fast food restaurants with reputations for meals working people can afford have recently been targeted by people complaining about inflation and \"greedflation\" in the U.S.\n\nIn February, hamburger chain Wendy's sparked a social media firestorm after its CEO said in a call with investors that the chain would experiment with \"dynamic pricing.\" Critics took the comment to suggest surge pricing often associated with airlines and the ride-hailing service Uber. Wendy's said that interpretation was inaccurate.\n\nBank of America, in an investor note, said it thinks menu pricing at McDonald's \"needs to moderate.\" McDonald's pricing, which it pegged as up 20% since 2022, had increased more than competitors like Wendy's (15%) and Burger King (16% at one franchisee).\n\n(Reporting by Waylon Cunningham; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "This article is an excerpt from the InvestorPlace Digest newsletter. To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox,\u00a0click here.\n\nIn February, AI superstar Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced fourth-quarter earnings that blew expectations out of the water. Shares rose 16% in a single day, adding $34 billion to shareholder pockets.\n\nThe fascinating thing, however, was what happened afterward. Because over the following month, shares of Nvidia rose another 20%. Even if investors completely missed out Nvidia\u2019s monster Q4 earnings, they could have made even more money from buying after the fact.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giant isn\u2019t alone in seeing this market momentum effect. Commodities\u2026 international stocks\u2026 real estate\u2026 virtually all well-traded assets seem to retain some \u201cmemory\u201d of their past movements. Rising prices tend to keep going up, while falling ones keep going down.\n\nMany academics have attempted to answer why. They studied the concepts of \u201cinertia\u201d and \u201charmonics\u201d as early as the 1930s. And later academic works in 1980s focused on data \u201cheterogeneity,\u201d a term for how information flows across markets. There is still no single answer that everyone agrees on.\n\nStill, we\u2019ve found that momentum works. Earnings beats tend to improve Wall Street\u2019s outlook on a company, which historically drives share prices higher. Successful companies also find it easier to raise capital and generate internal cash flows, which can fund even greater future successes. Nvidia itself expected to pour $9.2 billion into research and development (R&D) this year thanks to its windfall. It will outspend all but two other chip developers. It\u2019s why Louis Navellier considers earnings beats so crucial in his Portfolio Grader system, and why it features so heavily in my own MarketMaster AI trading system.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings are now creating a whole new market of \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d in this momentum-heavy market.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia are pulling ahead while consumer-facing firms are starting to fall behind. Earnings at firms like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) were so bad that writers at CNBC called this quarter the \u201clong-predicted consumer pullback.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the writers at our free news and analysis site \u2013 InvestorPlace.com \u2013 are focusing on successful companies that are announcing blowout earnings. Pandemic-era savings are beginning to deplete for both consumers and enterprises, and our analysts are closely watching which firms are succeeding.\n\n5 Stocks to Buy on Monster Q1 Earnings: Digital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), a data center real estate investment trust, announced stunning first-quarter results on May 2. Earnings per share of 82 cents blew expectations out of the water, while new bookings also came in strong. Wall Street was only expecting 24 cents EPS, so the world\u2019s largest owner of data centers beat forecasts by almost 250%.\n\nThese results were driven by 1) an insatiable demand for AI-related data centers and 2) a severe market shortage of them. DLR raised renewal prices by an average of 12% this quarter and booked a record $252 million in additional annualized revenue.\n\nAt InvestorPlace.com, Rich Duprey even sees Digital Realty Trust as a stock to buy for a potential downturn.\n\nBusiness continues to move its data to the cloud, and artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly critical component for ensuring the health and integrity of the information. The need for data centers won\u2019t abate during a market crash. It would be just as important that data is accessible and viable \u2014 if not more so, particularly considering the caliber of Digital Realty\u2019s clients.\n\nThat\u2019s because DLR will profit in both good times and bad. Companies are only creating more data, and the costs of analyzing this information are only growing. Cloud computing in the form of data centers provides a compelling solution.\n\nEven better, shares of Digital Realty Trust have not yet moved on earnings news. Shares are only up 3% since May 2, providing investors with an opening to buy the stock at a reasonable 20 times cash flow.\n\n2. Western Digital (WDC) photo of glass Western Digital (WDC) company building with black letter logo on front face\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.co\n\nMemory-chip maker Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) released an equally impressive earnings report on April 25. Revenues of $3.45 billion beat expectations by 3%, while earnings per share of 63 cents beat by 204%. After a terrible 2023, the cyclical memory industry is finally entering a period of growth again. Wall Street analysts have now raised their WDC target price to $86.60, up from $52 at the start of 2024.\n\nDuprey also notes this week at InvestorPlace.com that Western Digital has another potential catalyst to drive shares higher. The firm plans to split itself into two companies, and we know that spinoffs are historically strong events for returns.\n\nWestern Digital and Kioxia reportedly increased first-quarter output to 1.22 million units, according to industry site Omdia. That\u2019s a 20% increase over the 1.02 million units produced in the fourth quarter. That would be a fortuitous turnaround for the spinoff.\n\nShares of Western Digital have been rising ever since the separation was announced last year and the new company could make for an interesting play on the memory market.\n\nAnalysts have now raised their 2024 earnings estimates by 56% over the past 30 days. And given that Western Digital\u2019s stock hasn\u2019t really moved yet, this could present a compelling moment to jump in on a hidden gem before markets catch on.\n\n3. Robinhood (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company. The company offers mobile app and website that offers people the ability to invest in stocks\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nStock trading platform Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a tough company for long-term investors to buy. The firm scores an F grade in my MarketMaster AI system for its high short interest and lumpy profitability. Louis\u2019s Portfolio Grader awards Robinhood\u2019s fundamentals a C for similar reasons.\n\nHowever, the numbers don\u2019t lie: Robinhood could see a near-term boost in share prices thanks to blowout first-quarter earnings.\n\nOn May 9, the Silicon Valley-based firm announced quarterly revenues of $618 million and EPS of 18 cents, beating estimates by 13% and 226%, respectively. Rising cryptocurrency prices and renewed retail trading interest have put the company back on a path of growth. InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Larry Ramer notes that investment bank Mizuho has now raised its target price to $23, a 29% implied upside.\n\nFellow InvestorPlace.com writer Marc Guberti now urges investors to look beyond Robinhood\u2019s reputation as a one-trick pony.\n\nThe company\u2019s foray into innovative financial products and services can create more opportunities. Investors are monitoring the company\u2019s unlimited 3% cashback credit card that is available for Robinhood Gold members. Also, [the] fintech firm has an impressive 3% match for IRA contributions.\n\nVery few financial institutions and fintech companies have these types of offers. Most companies don\u2019t match any of your IRA contributions. Robinhood can gain more ground as it releases innovative products and its trading platform continues to perform well. While the fintech company has fallen by 49% since its IPO, the stock is up by [65]% YTD. Therefore, investors are starting to realize Robinhood\u2019s potential, and a recent switch to profitability has helped matters.\n\nPut another way, Robinhood\u2019s Q1 results might be a sign of even greater improvements to come. The company now earns over $250 million each quarter from interest-based revenues (the interest earned on investor cash deposits). And the rising popularity of options could put Robinhood\u2019s transaction revenues on more stable footing.\n\n4. SoFi (SOFI) An advertisement for SoFi, a fintech personal finance startup, in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline banking firm SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) joins the list of strong earners this quarter. Revenues came in 4.4% better than expected, its largest positive surprise since 2022. Earnings were also impressive, with total profits beating forecasts by a solid 20%.\n\nPerhaps the most notable feat, however, was that these figures were achieved without loan origination growth and only a 5.4% increase in loan balances. In other words, SoFi is purposely tapping on the brakes to balance its risks\u2026 and is still beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nWill Ashworth sees SoFi\u2019s conservative approach as a reason to buy shares.\n\n\u201cSoFi continues to add customers and deposits as its banking business grows,\u201d he writes at InvestorPlace.com. \u201cRestrained growth in a higher interest rate environment is a good thing.\u201d\n\nHe views the firm as the ultimate long-term winner.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. InvestorPlace\u2019s David Moadel sees shares topping $10 in the medium term, thanks to rising forecasts and strong underlying growth.\n\nEssentially, SoFi\u2019s management is keenly aware that banks that grow too quickly tend to face problems with bad loans. FICO credit scores only tell part of a borrower\u2019s story, and regional lenders like First Republic and Signature Bank folded in 2023 precisely because they grew too quickly in markets they didn\u2019t understand.\n\nSoFi is taking a different tack \u2013 allowing its services business (i.e., non-lending) to grow fast, while keeping loan growth to manageable levels. First-quarter results showed this strategy in full light, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before markets realize there\u2019s more to SoFi\u2019s story.\n\n5. Bumble (BMBL) The logo for Bumble (BMBL) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Josh Enomoto writes at InvestorPlace.com about Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL). The dating app, he writes, is a potential breakout stock.\n\nIn my opinion, Bumble needs a simple tweak. It needs to focus more on the business rather than attempting to engineer gender equity in relationships. That means in traditionally oriented couplings, the company must allow male users to reach out to female users. Currently, women must make the first move, which hurts participation and engagement\u2026\n\nA ship can always be righted if the damage is caught in time.\n\nSince that writeup, lo and behold, management says it is revamping Bumble\u2019s core business. Men can now make the first move if allowed, and the dating firm is also finding new ways to monetize through Premium+ subscriptions. As CEO Lidiane Jones noted in her Q1 earnings call:\n\nWe have expanded upon our signature make the first move by introducing choice in how connections made. Women can choose to make the first move as always. And now, they can choose to have a question set that their matches can respond to, creating a new way to engage with connection while retaining control\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re [also] expanding monetization, once our updated Premium+ subscription is here. We continue to have conviction that our subscription tiers are designed to bring value to our customers by offering them the fastest path to finding their matches.\n\nThe company also announced strong first-quarter earnings. Revenues of $268 million beat expectations by 1%, while EPS of 19 cents came in 181% ahead. Not only is management revamping its core user experience; these efforts are already having an effect.\n\nThese improvements will go a long way to win back skeptics. Analysts now expect Bumble to earn 86 cents per share this year in profits, a major upward revision since January. And growth is expected to accelerate through 2025 as these efforts play out. If history is any guide, Bumble\u2019s initial 7% post-earnings pop should be followed by even greater gains to come as markets begin to realize that Bumble\u2019s growth story is far from over.\n\nMarketMaster AI is an artificial-intelligence-powered stock picking system that uses an ensemble of neural networks to grade stocks based on their expected 6-month returns.

        "title": "At 67x Earnings, Chipotle Stock (NYSE:CMG) Is a Market Anomaly",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) owns and operates over 3,400 Mexican restaurants across five different countries. Investors have bid up its shares to 67x earnings, touting the company\u2019s growth, drive-throughs, recession-resistant demand, and balance sheet. However, at current interest rates, Chipotle\u2019s valuation is a market anomaly. The yield on government bonds far exceeds Chipotle\u2019s earnings yield, even into the distant future. Therefore, I\u2019m bearish on Chipotle stock.\n\nWhy Chipotle\u2019s Valuation Doesn\u2019t Make Sense\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \u201cInterest rates are to asset prices\u2026 like gravity is to the apple. They power everything in the economic universe.\u201d\n\nSo what did Buffett mean? Well, in finance, there\u2019s something called the \u201crisk-free rate.\u201d The premise is simple: if you can get 5% on a risk-free asset like a U.S. government bond, that should be the minimum required rate of return for a riskier, less certain asset like a stock. Additionally, you should have a \u201crisk premium\u201d that makes up for the extra risk.\n\nOver the past 150 years, the 10-year treasury has yielded an average of approximately 5%, which is slightly above where we are now. In the same time frame, the median S&P 500 P/E ratio was 15x, providing a 6.66% earnings yield plus growth. This resulted in compound annual returns of around 9.2% for the S&P 500 (over 150 years), meaning that the average equity risk premium over that time was about 4.2%.\n\nThe problem is that Chipotle has the opposite of a risk premium, making it look extremely overvalued. For example, on analyst earnings estimates, Chipotle has forward P/E ratios of 57x in 2024, 48x in 2025, 40x in 2026, 33x in 2027, and 28x in 2028. This translates to earnings yields of 1.75%, 2.08%, 2.50%, 3.03%, and 3.57%. These earnings yields are nowhere near the 5.21% you can get on a one-year treasury or the 4.59% you can get on a five-year treasury.\n\nEven if Chipotle lives up to analysts\u2019 lofty growth expectations (and I don\u2019t believe it will) and then trades at a P/E ratio of 30x on its 2028 earnings, you would get a total return of less than 2% per annum, which translates to a negative equity risk premium. This is a market anomaly. But, like Buffett said, gravity should eventually take hold.\n\nIf the market decides to re-rate Chipotle at a lower P/E ratio, say 35x on current earnings (providing a 2.86% earnings yield plus growth), the stock price would fall by nearly 50%. A 35x P/E ratio may seem low now, but it is still significantly above where Starbucks (NYSE:SBUX) and McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) currently trade. Chipotle traded at a P/E ratio of around 25x from 2008-2010, when it had a much larger growth opportunity ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle\u2019s Growth Will Slow\n\nChipotle\u2019s earnings have grown at a blistering pace over the past five years. From 2018 to 2023, the company\u2019s EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 47.7%. This was partially the result of the company improving its return on assets. In other words, Chipotle was underearning back in 2018, with just a 7.79% return on assets.\n\nMeanwhile, companies with similar business models, like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks, were earning an 18% return on assets in 2018 (more than double the returns at Chipotle). Chipotle\u2019s weak returns from 2016 to 2020 were likely due to foodborne illness problems and legal issues that tarnished its reputation and hurt its bottom line. However, Chipotle\u2019s customers have come back in a big way, and the company has improved returns through its loyalty program, expansion, and drive-throughs.\n\nIf we fast-forward to 2023, Chipotle doubled its return on assets to 15.41%, in line with other owner-operated chains. For example, Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s also have returns on assets in the 14-16% range, which is high versus the industry\u2019s historical average.\n\nAll this means that growth will likely slow at Chipotle. For example, Chipotle\u2019s 10-year average EPS CAGR was much lower at 15.5%. I expect that the company\u2019s growth could be even less than this rate, going forward. Last year, Chipotle grew its restaurant count by just 8%. The company also relies on buybacks, which will be ineffective at 67x earnings. Additionally, there\u2019s the risk that management fails to deliver.\n\nIs CMG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nCurrently, 18 out of 26 analysts covering CMG give it a Buy rating; eight rate it a Hold, and zero analysts rate it a Sell, resulting in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average Chipotle Mexican Grill stock price target\u00a0is $3,250.58, implying upside potential of 3.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $2,700 per share to a high of $3,600 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on CMG Stock\n\nInterest rates would likely need to move closer to 0% for Chipotle\u2019s valuation to make sense. The stock appears to have a deeply negative equity risk premium. Should Chipotle\u2019s P/E ratio fall from 67x to a more appropriate multiple of 35x on current earnings, the stock could crash by nearly 50%.\n\nMeanwhile, I think Chipotle\u2019s earnings growth rate will slow in the years ahead to be less than its 10-year average of 15.5%. It grew at a blistering pace over the past five years, partially due to its return on assets doubling. Now on par with McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks on this metric (and on the high end historically), I think this tailwind is gone. Further, buybacks are likely to be ineffective at these levels, and the company\u2019s store count grew by just 8% last year.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Stocks outperform all other assets over time. Not gold, bonds, oil, U.S. Treasuries or real estate surpass the wealth-generating abilities of stocks over the last 100 years. If you want to get rich, buying stocks is the way to go.\n\nBut which stocks to buy? The asset managers at Hartford Funds looked at the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 going all the way back to 1930. They found that no matter what time frame they looked at, dividend stocksnever had a losing decade. Even during the so-called \u201clost decade\u201d of the 2000\u2019s when the benchmark index suffered negative returns, dividend-paying stocks generated 1.8% annualized positive returns.\n\nThis is why you should consider adding Dividend Aristocrats to your portfolio. Another J.P. Morgan Asset Management study found that stocks that initiated and then raised their payouts over a 40-year period between 1972 and 2012 returned an average of 9.5% a year, versus just 1.6% for non-dividend-paying stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDividend Aristocrats are stocks that raised their payout for 25 consecutive years or more. The seven members of dividend royalty below are all stalwart companies that have stumbled in 2024. Their stocks are down by at least 12% this year but still have long-term growth potential.\n\nAlbermarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium miner Albermarle (NYSE:ALB) is the weakest Dividend Aristocrat on this list despite owning one of the largest lithium mines in the world, the Greenbushes mine near Perth, Australia. The stock was added to the list of royals in 2019 and continues to raise its payout to this day, but its record of producing sufficient free cash flow (FCF) to support the dividend is spotty. Its rate of increases has also slowed, down to an average of 1.7% annually over the last five years.\n\nYet lithium remains a critical metal for electric vehicles and demand for it is expected to double by 2030 to more than 2.4 million metric tons, according to Statista. It is forecast to go on to reach 3.8 million metric tons by 2035. Lithium prices, which have fallen markedly in recent periods, is poised to begin rising again in the back half of this year.\n\nAlbermarle\u2019s Greenbushes is one of the lowest-cost lithium hydroxide producers while its Chilean operations are among the world\u2019s lowest-cost sources of lithium. The miner also owns assets in the U.S. and Argentina that should allow it to boost volumes in the future as they are developed. Although down 11.7% in 2024, the stock ought to recover and is already up 20% off recent lows.\n\nStory continues\n\nPPG Industries (PPG) PPG Paints retail location. PPG stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nPaint and coatings specialist PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) is the world\u2019s largest producer of architectural coatings. But it is restructuring its business to focus solely on its best, most profitable operations. PPG is looking to sell its U.S. and Canadian architectural coatings business and previously sold off its traffic markings business in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. It is may also sell its silica unit and is exploring a full range of strategic alternatives for the business.\n\nBy narrowing its operations, PPG should benefit from ongoing growth in industrial and new, single-family housing starts. The coatings giant also recorded strong, first-quarter results in China and India.\n\nPPG stock is down 12.1% but is beginning to seeing traction with its turnaround plans. Shares are up 9% from their 52-week low. Its dividend remains secure. Having made a payout for 125 consecutive years and raised the dividend every year for the past 52 years, there is little risk of the dividend being cut. It yields 2% annually and sports a low 32% FCF payout ratio, meaning there is plenty of room for future increases.\n\nStanley Black & Decker (SWK) Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security products\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest tool company, Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK), is another stock that has paid a dividend for over 100 years. It made its first payment in 1877 and never stopped. It has increased the dividend every year since 1967 and there is little risk of a cut here as well. Stanley\u2019s FCF payout ratio is 56%, well within the margin of safety.\n\nThe hand and power tool company owns some of the best-known brands on the market beyond its namesake Stanley and Black & Decker banners. It also owns Bostitch, Craftsman, DeWalt, Irwin, Mac Tools, and Porter-Cable, among others.\n\nLike PPG Industries, Stanley is also in the midst of a turnaround. It previously engaged in a massive rollup of the tool industry, evident in the number of top-notch brands it owns. Now it seeks to cut costs and reduce inventory. President and CEO Donald Allan, Jr. said after its first-quarter results, \u201cStanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business\u2026we are positioning the company to deliver higher levels of organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns.\u201d\n\nThe stock, which is down 12.2% this year, has climbed 16% above recent lows and is 11% above last year\u2019s level. The dividend yields 3.8% annually.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough unstated, the primary cause of the decline in these dividend titans is the impact of high inflation and high interest rates sapping the strength of consumers and businesses. Because of government-induced inflation, the Federal Reserve engaged in an unprecedented, aggressive campaign to raise interest rates. The result is consumers feeling the pinch.\n\nThat is on display in no better place than fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). As the epitome of good, tasty food that could readily feed a family at low cost, the burger joint has been hurt by consumers needing to cut back to buy only essentials. McDonald\u2019s stock is down 13% this year but only 11% higher over the past three years. That is less than half the 26% returns generated by the S&P 500.\n\nYet the fast-food chain is trying to woo back customers with new value meal offerings. It just introduced a new $5, as did rival Burger King. Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) offered a $3 breakfast option, showing that the malaise in dining out is not just limited to McDonald\u2019s. As McDonald\u2019s still owns the breakfast daypart as the leading coffee shop, there is plenty of growth available.\n\nIts dividend yields 2.6% and though its FCF payout ratio may seem high at 62%, the burger shop has steadily reduced the rate over the past decade from around 75%. Trading at less than 22 times trailing earnings, McDonald\u2019s stock is at a historically low level.\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM) Image of a tractor cultivating field\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAgricultural products processor Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) is one of the biggest traders in grains and oilseeds. Its problem has been the volatility in the commodities markets brought on by wild gyrations in pricing. That was apparent in its first-quarter results, which saw profits tumble 24% as its ag services and oilseeds business saw lower crop pricing. These segments generate the majority of ADM\u2019s profits. Shares, though, have fallen 16% in 2024 though they\u2019ve swung 20% higher from their January lows.\n\nAnalysts see Archer-Daniels-Midland in the middle of the commodities cycle following its peak in 2022. It had generated significant profits during that time and is now coming down from those levels. To help smooth out the large swings in its results, the ag stock is developing a leadership position in human and animal nutrition in the food, beverages and food supplement businesses. They are still a small portion of its business now but are seeing some of the strongest growth for it.\n\nADM also has a 50-year history of raising its dividend, which yields 3.3%. Its FCF payout ratio of 33% shows there is a long runway for future dividend increases.\n\nBrown-Forman (BF-A, BF-B)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlcohol stocks tend to be recession-resistant and Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A, BF-B) owns the top name in whiskey, Jack Daniels. Shares of the distiller, though, are down 19.9% so far this year. Despite this, Brown-Forman should readily recover and continue its growth trajectory as the premiumization trend in spirits, especially in whiskey and bourbon, continues.\n\nCertainly other beverage makers want to cash in on Brown-Forman\u2019s positioning. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), for example, partnered with the distiller to create ready-to-drink beverages. Coke calls the combination \u201cone of the world\u2019s most requested \u2018bar calls.'\u201d You can hear patrons ask for a \u201cJack and Coke\u201d any night of the week at a local pub.\n\nBrown-Forman has paid cash dividends for almost 80 years and has raised its payout annually for 40 straight years. The dividend yields 1.8% a year and president and CEO Lawson Whiting said its latest hike last November \u201creinforces our confidence in Brown\u2011Forman\u2019s long-term growth outlook.\u201d\n\nFranklin Resources (BEN) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Franklin Resources (BEN).\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrat down the most in 2024 is Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), best known for its Franklin Templeton family of funds. Its shares are down 21.7% this year. The leading asset management firm has $1.64 trillion in assets under management (AUM), a 13% increase from the previous quarter.\n\nWhile Archer-Daniels-Midland sees swings in commodity prices that affect its performance, Franklin Resources suffers the same consequences depending on how the stock market moves.\n\nNegative investor sentiment causes large outflows of money from the funds as investors hunker down, a situation that has marked the past two years. First, there was the worst inflation rate in 40 years, and then as mentioned previously, the Fed\u2019s unprecedented interest rate hikes made investors cautious about the central bank causing a hard landing for the economy.\n\nThe ongoing bull market, though, caused investor sentiment to turn again, and that\u2019s why Franklin Resources is experiencing significant cash inflows. The asset manager is now expanding into new verticals that should offer considerable growth opportunities.\n\nThe company has an unbroken 43-year history of increasing its payout with the dividend yielding a juicy 5.3% annually.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in PPG, KO and BEN stock.

        "content": "Investors who buy dividend stocks do so for the current income and the potential for that income to grow in the future. There are a couple of ways to ensure that happens. One is to assume a steady dividend and reinvest dividend income to buy fractions of more dividend stocks. The other is to hope that the issuing company increases its dividend payment in the future.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what the three firms discussed below have done. Two of them have increased their dividend growth rate by 15% or more over the past 5 years. Investors will always appreciate greater amounts of income from their portfolios. That\u2019s what makes investing in fast-growing dividend stocks so appealing. Let\u2019s take a look at those three companies and their respective, fast-growing dividends.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock has exploded in value on the success of weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company has other strong therapeutics including Jardiance and is much more than a one-trick pony but it is the weight loss drugs that have drawn so much investor attention of late.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors are well aware of that narrative and the rationale for investing in Eli Lilly at the moment. However, far fewer investors are probably aware of how quickly Eli Lilly has grown its dividend. That dividend has grown at an average annual rate of 15% over the past 5 years. It was also last reduced in 1986 and is very stable overall.\n\nSales grew by 26% in the first quarter primarily on the strength of its weight loss drug portfolio. that allowed the company to increase its 2024 guidance by $2 billion. Thus, it\u2019s reasonable to anticipate that Eli Lilly May increase the pace of its dividend growth moving forward. it will certainly have the funds for such a decision if it chooses to do so.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) stock boasts the fastest-growing dividend of the three shares discussed here. The company has grown that dividend at an average annual rate of 16% over the past 5 years.\n\nAs impressive as the dividend growth has been at Visa it\u2019s hardly the only reason to consider investing in the stock. The company\u2019s recent financial performance has been exceptionally strong. The American consumer continues to spend heavily leading to incredible credit card debt overall but strong performance for Visa. In the second quarter, both revenues and net income increased by 10% at the company.\n\nAlthough Visa has grown its dividend rapidly the overall yield remains relatively low, below 1%. it\u2019s certainly not the kind of dividend an investor should consider for its overall income production. However, it\u2019s a strong company and in a few decades that dividend should be much larger. Beyond that, Visa is worth buying for its exposure to broad fintech trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) MCD Stock: a McDonald's sign and logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a strong dividend investment overall that will pop up on all sorts of lists discussing income stocks. The company is also currently facing issues which is probably the best place to start when discussing it.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is relatively flat performance wise and the stock has declined in 2024 as a result. the company is not considered to be the same value option that it was in years past. In response, the company has attempted to reintroduce popular discounts including a $5 meal deal. The company was kicking that idea around earlier in the year but it fell by the wayside, likely due to franchisee pushback. However, the company reintroduced the idea in recent weeks and will reintroduce the $5 meal deal for 4 weeks beginning in late June.\n\nSo, there\u2019s plenty of reason to believe that McDonald\u2019s is capable of winning back disgruntled customers. That\u2019s probably the best reason to invest in McDonald\u2019s at the moment after it has fallen in 2024.\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at its dividend growth as a secondary factor. McDonald\u2019s has grown that dividend at an annual average of 7.6% over the past 5 years. Share prices are likely to move higher in the wake of the $5 deal meal deal announcement and dividend growth will continue to be strong. I\u2019d say that makes McDonald\u2019s stock a worthwhile investment at the moment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Battered Stocks That Even Warren Buffett Could Be Eyeing",
        "content": "One of many ways legendary investor Warren Buffett has achieved\u00a0great wealth is buying\u00a0blue chip stocks when they are beaten down for the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B), the conglomerate he founded and heads. Buffett likes to invest in industry leaders in sectors he understands. He was leery of tech stocks and it took him a long time to load up on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), now it is his biggest holding. His portfolio reflects this outlook with another large position being Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nA large economic moat is also found in many Warren Buffett stocks. This is what protects the business from the forces of competition\u00a0and time. For Coca-Cola in large part, it is the brand and all that it entails. For the railroad holdings of Buffett, it is the sprawling infrastructure that comes with a major player in the transportation sector.\n\nThe wide and deep insurance holdings of Buffett show his appreciation for the time value of money. For this, you want someone to pay you as far in advance as far as possible so you can \u201cplay the float\u201d and profit. The most recent Buffett investment was Chubb (NYSE:CB), the insurance giant. Due to seeking to be on the profit-making side of the float, there are many other insurance companies in the portfolio and even Blue Chip Stamps, an early loyalty program that kicked off cash. Many times the money is free as it is never cashed in for the item.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBoeing (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft. stocks to buy and sell related to Boeing\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) has a wide economic moat in an industry America invented and dominates. It functions in basically a duopoly with only Airbus (OTCSMKTS:EADSY), the European multinational aerospace firm.\n\nThe allure of the aviation industry is easily understood. Just look up! What is difficult for many to fathom is Boeing\u2019s decline.\u00a0Aerospace consultant Dr.\u00a0Mike Heil, who headed the Ohio Aerospace Institute, told\u00a0InvestorPlace, \u201cBoeing\u2019s long and unfortunate decline began when their emphasis shifted from engineering and product excellence to their stock price and short term financial performance. The bean counters took over, moved the headquarters away from their engineers, and started outsourcing manufacturing and engineering to cut costs. The dire results were predictable.\u201d\n\nWith all respect to Elon Musk and The Boring Company, his tunneling outfit, air travel will dominate the future. That makes the present decline in the stock price of Boeing is an opportunity.\n\nBoeing also goes nicely with Buffett\u2019s investments in NetJets and railroads.\u00a0NetJets is a private jet company for high-end travelers.\u00a0Railroads haul bulk.\u00a0Passengers and light cargo fly on Boeing planes.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) Southwest Airlines logo on aircraft that is taking off from McCarran in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nSource: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa / Shutterstock.com\n\nTraditionally, Southwest\u00a0Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was the dominant airline. It carried the most domestic passengers and never lost money.\u00a0 Southwest is the only legacy carrier to never go bankrupt and has always posted a profit.\u00a0A big reason for this is Southwest only flies the Boeing 737.\u00a0As a result it is more efficient and kicks off more cash.\u00a0\u00a0But it also suffers when Boeing is hurting, as it is presently. When Boeing recovers things will be much better for Southwest Airlines, too!\n\nSouthwest also fits in with NetJets and the railroads.\u00a0NetJets fly affluent passengers.\u00a0 Southwest is a discount airlines. Railroads carry freight and Southwest carries passengers seeking a fare cheaper than NetJets.\n\nAirlines also offer float income.\u00a0Southwest sells tickets for travel a year into the future. So if you book a flight for April 2025 and pay for it today, there is almost a year of free money before having to provide the service for the payment. In addition, if Buffett were to invest in Southwest and Boeing he could work to keep Boeing as the only plane in the fleet. This would protect two of his potential investments!\n\nSouthwest took a major step recently to bring in more passengers. Previously tickets had to be bought through its website. Flights will now be displayed on Google Flight, the travel sales arm of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL). Obviously something was working before as Southwest was the leader in domestic passengers carried. Still, this is a step in the right direction of turning things around for the airline.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is more than just coffee. One meme says \u201cStarbucks is a bank dressed up as a coffee shop\u201d due to its loyalty program\u2019s success. Starbucks Rewards has 34 million members who load or reload $10 billion annually.\u00a0 These numbers are increasing.\u00a0 This is very attractive to Buffett. Starbucks gets the money, plays the float, books investment income and delivers the goods and services later.\n\nUntil it is spent, this would be more free money for Buffett to invest.\u00a0 Up to one-fifth of gift cards remain unspent and more than 5% is never used.\u00a0So if $10 billion goes on Starbucks Rewards Apps yearly and 5% is never spent, the house nets $50 million annually just from those funds never used.\n\nBuffett was, at one time, one of the largest sharehlders of RJR, the cigarette maker due to the brand loyalty. He should similarly love the brand loyalty Starbucks creates for a more appealing consumer good with a high profit margin.\n\nBig Coffee could easily team up with other Buffett consumer holdings, too. Starbucks could sell Sees Candies, one of Buffet\u2019s favorite assets, in the way McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is bringing in Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) pastries to fill a hole in its breakfast lineup. Other possibilities include Dairy Queen or Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC).\n\nThe combination could serve up tasty returns for Buffett\u2019s portfolio!\n\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on McDonald's is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$12b \u00f7 (US$54b - US$4.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured McDonald's' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for McDonald's .\n\nSo How Is McDonald's' ROCE Trending?\n\nMcDonald's is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 21% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs discussed above, McDonald's appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And with a respectable 45% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.\n\nIf you'd like to know about the risks facing McDonald's, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "MCD, YUM: Fast-Food Slump Could be a Buying Opportunity",
        "content": "Fast-food firms like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) have been under some pressure lately. Though leading fast-food brands have some impressive pricing power, it\u2019s probably safe to say that some chains have vastly overestimated their pricing power. When it comes to McDonald\u2019s, or Yum-owned Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, consumers have come to expect cheap eats. Come summer, McDonald\u2019s and Yum! are poised to deliver more on the value front, which could bring back consumers and share price momentum.\n\nApart from the delicious taste, secret sauces, and family recipes (the colonel\u2019s spice blend is still virtually unmatched, in my opinion), a major reason why people choose to go to a fast-food chain is affordability and convenience. All things considered, I\u2019m bullish on MCD and YUM stock and view the recent stagnation as more of a golden buying opportunity.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: Golden Buying Opportunity in the Golden Arches\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is arguably one of the most efficiently-run restaurant chains in the industry. And it\u2019s getting even more efficient as it uses technology (think improved tracking for deliveries made within the loyalty app) while also testing new \u201creal estate-light\u201d store concepts like CosMc\u2019s and takeout-focused restaurants.\n\nWith its fast-moving double-lane drive-thrus at some modernized locations and other tech-driven optimizations at the store level, McDonald\u2019s may be leaving rivals behind. These advancements are helping to remove friction from ordering.\n\nSuch distinct advantages, I believe, make MCD stock worth buying on the dip, even as temporary inflation-era headwinds nibble away at comparable sales growth, which slowed to 1.9% in Q1 2024, down from 3.4% a quarter prior.\n\nFurther, with the massive number of restaurants that draw massive crowds in, many of whom come for the meal deals but stick around for the dessert and McCaf\u00e9 drinks, it\u2019s tough to get more convenient than driving through the local McDonald\u2019s or ordering in some McDelivery. Despite the convenience factor, however, consumers have shown they may not be as willing to tolerate price increases as the firm may have initially thought. At least, that\u2019s what the latest quarter is telling us.\n\nAfter witnessing the quarter be weighed down by many belt-tightening customers, I\u2019m inclined to believe value may be as big of a deal as convenience. With a limited-time $5.00 meal deal planned for the summer, it seems like McDonald\u2019s is firing the first shots that mark the start of fast-food deflation.\n\nDid some fast-food firms raise prices too high, too fast, just like McDonald\u2019s did in the past year? It definitely seems that way. Now, we could see value hop into the driver\u2019s seat for the summertime as firms look to pull back on pricing.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s a good time to be a fast-food fan. But only time will tell if summertime value menus save the slumping fast-food stocks. My guess is such deep-value promos will get crowds coming back, but whether they\u2019ll stay once the deals are gone is another question entirely. There\u2019s always a chance they\u2019ll have more of an opportunity to grow accustomed to today\u2019s higher prices. That is, of course, if deflation isn\u2019t on the menu for 2025 and beyond.\n\nAt 22.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), which is around 30% lower than the 31.2 times P/E multiple it commanded during its June 2023 quarter, the stock\u2019s current multiple looks just as tempting as its new value menu. The 2.5% dividend yield is also a nice addition.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for MCD Stock?\n\nMCD stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys and 10 Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average MCD stock price target of $304.21 implies 17.7% upside potential.\n\nYum! Brands: Menu Innovation and Value\n\nRecently, Yum Brands\u2019 KFC also jumped aboard the sizzling summertime discounting bandwagon with its \u201cTaste of KFC Deals\u201d value menu. The menu offers options starting at $4.99 for two pieces of chicken, gravy-drenched mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. Wendy\u2019s (NYSE:WEN) also announced its $3.00 breakfast bundle, a seemingly direct response to McDonald\u2019s latest value offering.\n\nIndeed, it seems that value is the name of the game for fast-food firms as they seek to gain an upper hand on one another while attempting to attract budget-conscious customers.\n\nUnlike MCD stock, which is in correction territory, YUM stock is about 3% away from new highs. Despite a soft recent quarter, Yum! Brands may benefit from a combination of menu innovation and value menus to drive growth.\n\nThe latest quarter saw falling sales in some segments, with U.S. KFC sales slumping by 2%, with most weakness coming from the U.S. market (comparable sales fell 8%). Undoubtedly, Americans have felt the inflationary pinch, but don\u2019t count on them to be gone for very long\u2014not with the new value menu deal in place.\n\nOf all the fast-food chains, Yum! deserves top marks for menu innovation. KFC\u2019s Double Down sandwich is a great contender in the chicken sandwich wars. At Pizza Hut, Melts may be enough to draw in hungry customers.\n\nIn any case, YUM stock looks way too cheap at 24.7 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below the 32.5 times multiple it commanded during its June 2023 quarter. Inflation headwinds won\u2019t last forever \u2014 not once menu innovation and value menus begin to impact coming quarters.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for YUM Stock?\n\nYUM stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and 10 Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average YUM stock price target of $146.13 implies 6.2% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nFast-food chains won\u2019t stay stagnant forever. Value menus could bring back crowds for summer, but McDonald\u2019s and Yum! will need to do more to keep them sticking around. Perhaps menu innovation and more caution on future price increases will be key to not scaring consumers off again. Overall, analysts are bullish on both stocks, but between the two, they expect more upside from MCD stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Retailer Canada Goose Holdings Inc (NYSE:GOOS) ranks 7th in our list of the 7 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish On. In this article we will take a look at the reasons why Cramer doesn't like the stock. But first, let's see his take on the current situation of the financial markets.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program yet again lamented over the market\u2019s obsession about the Fed\u2019s stance over sticky inflation, saying the latest Fed minutes from April 30 to May 1 spooked investors because the central bank officials seem to be getting \u201cimpatient\u201d with the inflation\u2019s slower-than-expected decline.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that economic data released after these Fed minutes showed that the labor market as well as inflation are cooling, exactly what the Fed wants. Cramer said had the Fed officials seen this data before, their minutes would have been different.\n\nCramer said that the Fed needs to know that their \u201cinflation lamentation\u201d from three weeks ago isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nJim Cramer said that consumer spending has been the biggest issue for the Federal Reserve as they wonder, \u201cis they any place that\u2019s too high for them (consumers).\u201d Cramer acknowledged that without putting brakes on consumer spending it\u2019d be impossible to beat inflation.\n\nHowever, the CNBC host said that if Fed officials had paid attention they\u2019d have found that they are \u201cfinally\u201d winning their battle against consumer spending too.\n\nJim Cramer said there are \u201cnascent signs\u201d showing that the consumers are finally saying \u201cenough is enough.\u201d Cramer pointed to Walmart\u2019s latest numbers as a sign of consumers\u2019 preference for discount retailers. Cramer said Walmart is one of the few companies offering value in budget.\n\n\u201cThe Consumer Has Had Enough\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter years of seemingly endless price increases, the consumer has had enough.

The firm, widely known for its iconic down parkas, has expanded its product offerings in recent years and has embarked on a strategic shift from a wholesaling model toward a vertically integrated direct-to-consumer model. The stock fell during the quarter as the company continued to underperform its luxury peer\u2019s post-pandemic. The company\u2019s significant investments in brick-and-mortar stores also underperformed, particularly in China, where the slow-to-materialize consumer recovery has weighed on results.

These massive companies in the industry provide defensive equities that are attractive buys for investors looking to strengthen their holdings.\n\nThe first one shows\u00a0substantial expansion in margins and profit growth. As a fundamental requirement, its diverse range of medical equipment and medicines offers a robust platform for stability and future growth.\n\nThe second one has robust returns, due to its strategy focus on digital transformation and worldwide development. As food consumption is always vital, the corporation may exploit digital channels and grow its worldwide footprint, despite macroeconomic problems.\u00a0Strong loyalty programs and record mobile app orders support long-term sales growth and consumer engagement.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLastly, the third one focuses on modernization, has great sector performance and is growing in digital sales. The corporation reduces the dangers associated with excessive dependence on a particular brand or consumption topic by maintaining a broad brand portfolio.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) net earnings for the quarter came to $5.35 billion, with diluted earnings per share at $2.20. While adjusted diluted profits per share climbed by 12.4% to $2.71, adjusted net earnings increased by 3.8% to $6.6 billion. Similarly, diluted EPS from adjusted operations grew by\u00a012.4%.\n\nAdditionally, Johnson & Johnson has demonstrated effective cost control and profitability.\u00a0This\u00a0is reflected in the significant increase in earnings, both in absolute terms and on a per-share basis. The adjusted EPS and margin expansion increase signifies the company\u2019s fundamental capacity to derive greater profits from its activities.\n\nFurthermore, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s strategic acquisitions, such as Shockwave Medical and Ambrx, aim to enhance the competitive strength of its product portfolio.\n\nMoreover, the Innovative Medicine segment has\u00a0$13.6 billion in revenues and a 2.5% global growth rate. On the other hand, MedTech\u2019s sales of $7.8 billion represented a 6.3% increase.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has a varied portfolio of medicines and medical devices.\u00a0This\u00a0allows it to seize opportunities in many healthcare categories.

The company opened its 6,000th location in China, reflecting its focus on rapidly growing internationally, even in the face of obstacles like the Middle East conflict.\n\nHence, this\u00a0affects the International Developmental Licensed Markets division.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also uses technology and digital media to improve customer experiences and boost revenue. Increased loyalty sales and record mobile app orders are indicators of effective digital penetration and\u00a0engagement tactics. Thus, the increased frequency of devoted consumers\u2019 spending can\u00a0be attributed\u00a0to the personalization of experiences through loyalty programs.\n\nAdditionally, customers have responded favorably to McDonald\u2019s creative marketing initiatives, such as the WcDonald\u2019s campaign and menu upgrades like Best Burger. These moves have boosted category sales and brand enthusiasm.\n\nWith over 6 billion impressions and\u00a0around 100,000 mentions on social media, McDonald\u2019s marketing campaigns are effective due to strong customer interaction.\n\nOverall, there is consistent growth against flat to declining industry traffic in\u00a0major\u00a0markets, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) a tray of food from popeyes\n\nSource: Tony Prato / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid segment performance across Popeyes, Tim Hortons, Burger King and Firehouse Subs for Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) in Q1 2024.

Rising digital sales are evidence of Restaurant Brands\u2019 effective use of technology to improve client interactions and boost revenue.\n\nElevated levels of digital penetration indicate effective digital marketing tactics, optimized ordering procedures and robust consumer interaction via digital platforms.\n\nFinally, a\u00a0$300 million investment has been made to renovate Burger King locations, which signifies Restaurant Brands\u2019 focus on updating their restaurant locations and improving the customer experience.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in JNJ.

        "content": "Right now, investors are on top of the world. The major American equity indexes seemingly hit new record highs almost every week. Innovations in fields such as artificial intelligence offer tremendous promise to grow corporate earnings and lead to new technological breakthroughs.\n\nBut the good times won\u2019t last forever. They never do. Whether the market rolls over next week, next quarter, or years from now, there will inevitably come a point when things get ugly out there on Wall Street once again.\n\nThey say the best time to buy an umbrella is while the sun is still shining. In the same way, it\u2019s a great time to pick up some defensive stocks to own in tough times while the markets are still at record highs. Because, whenever that correction comes, it\u2019s best to prepare in advance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCarriage Services (CSV) A funeral scene with casket and flowers.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCarriage Services (NYSE:CSV) is one of the most recession-resistant businesses imaginable.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the company offers funeral and cemetery services. Regardless of what\u2019s going on with the economy, people are unable to cheat death.\n\nIn fact, perversely, shares of Carriage Services soared during the pandemic as investors speculated that COVID-19 would lead to higher death rates and thus more activity at Carriage Services. Thankfully, that scenario largely didn\u2019t come to pass, and CSV stock quickly retreated to its pre-pandemic levels.\n\nCarriage Services is not a fast-growing business, for obvious reasons. However, its revenues are about as dependable as they come. And shares are currently being offered at just 12 times forward earnings. The company is also currently\u00a0paying down debt, which should help profitability in the current higher interest rate environment.\n\nWhile Carriage Services is hardly the most exciting business in the world, it\u2019s just the sort of security you might want to own when times get tough. And at today\u2019s starting price, that defensive portfolio is at ]an attractive entry point.\n\nHormel Foods (HRL) Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo. HRL stock.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\n\nHormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a packaged foods company focused on protein products. Known for its canned pork product Spam, the Hormel of nowadays is more focused on health-conscious products such as natural and organic meats, guacamole, Mexican salsas, and nuts and nut butter.\n\nLike many consumer staples companies, Hormel stock has dramatically underperformed the stock market over the past couple of years. Hormel\u2019s profit margins have been hit as prices of key commodities such as livestock and grains surged. In addition, investors are less interested in perceived stodgy blue-chip sorts of companies during a raging bull market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a downturn, however, that will change. Food consumption often seems almost unaffected by changes in broader economic conditions. If anything, a weakening economy will cause some folks to trade down from restaurant meals to grocery shopping, and Hormel\u2019s protein-forward offerings make for filling entrees and snacks.\n\nHRL stock has started to bounce back in 2024 as the company\u2019s margins have inflected upward. It\u2019s starting to look like Hormel is a great contrarian bet for this year and beyond and perhaps among the stocks to own in tough times.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nTurning from groceries to fast food, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is another bargain food option whose value proposition shines during recessions.\n\nRecently, expensive fast-casual options such as Sweetgreen (NYSE:SG) and Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) have dominated the fast food market. In a growing economy, it makes sense for people to splurge on these interesting offerings, particularly as younger consumers tend to prioritize health-conscious dining options.\n\nIn an economic recession, however, the appetite for $18 salads tends to dry up. People return to tried-and-true budget options. McDonald\u2019s, with its worldwide brand and fast affordable menu offerings, fits the bill perfectly.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is also more stable than most of its rivals since it owns so much of the land under its restaurants. In fact, some people have joked that McDonald\u2019s is a real estate business that has a side hustle flipping hamburgers.\n\nIn short, McDonald\u2019s has a strong balance sheet and a business built to shine during recessions. MCD stock has underperformed recently, giving investors a chance to buy this safe haven blue chip stock at a discount today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HRL stock.

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why Jim Cramer is Bearish on Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA)",
        "content": "Insider Monkey recently published a list of 7 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish On. Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA)\u00a0ranks second in that list. Since Under Armour is a popular name among both hedge funds and retail investors, it deserver a detailed look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program yet again lamented over the market's obsession about the Fed's stance over sticky inflation, saying the latest Fed minutes from April 30 to May 1 spooked investors because the central bank officials seem to be getting \"impatient\" with the inflation's slower-than-expected decline.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that economic data released after these Fed minutes showed that the labor market as well as inflation are cooling, exactly what the Fed wants. Cramer said had the Fed officials seen this data before, their minutes would have been different.\n\nCramer said that the Fed needs to know that their \"inflation lamentation\" from three weeks ago isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nJim Cramer said that consumer spending has been the biggest issue for the Federal Reserve as they wonder, \"is they any place that's too high for them (consumers).\" Cramer acknowledged that without putting brakes on consumer spending it'd be impossible to beat inflation.\n\nHowever, the CNBC host said that if Fed officials had paid attention they'd have found that they are \"finally\" winning their battle against consumer spending too.\n\nJim Cramer said there are \"nascent signs\" showing that the consumers are finally saying \"enough is enough.\" Cramer pointed to Walmart's latest numbers as a sign of consumers' preference for discount retailers. Cramer said Walmart is one of the few companies offering value in budget.\n\n\"The Consumer Has Had Enough\"\n\n\"After years of seemingly endless price increases, the consumer has had enough. Consumers are now staying more at home.\"\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted latest comments from Kevin Hourican, the CEO of Sysco, which supplies food products to restaurants. Hourican said that the industry needs to do \"something\" about the rising prices that are affecting foot traffic at restaurants.\n\nJim Cramer thinks a \"consumer rebellion\" is happening in the industry which has executives scratching their heads.\n\nAnother sign of this rebellion, according to Cramer, is major companies like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) rolling out budget options. Cramer said that consumers also has had enough of price increases at McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), and the company needed these budget menu offerings to increase traffic.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cramer is bullish on stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), he's recommending investors to stay away from UAA. Let's see why.\n\nUnder Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nJim Cramer recently said in a program that he's a \"huge supporter\" of Kevin Plank, Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) founder and CEO. \u00a0However, he said he's not a supporter of the stock. That's because, according to Cramer, the competition in the athletic apparel industry is very high. Cramer said he's sure if Kevin Plank goes to another industry he'd be \"crushing it\" but in this industry you have to compete with major players like Nike and New Balance.\n\n\"These are just serious competitors and you've got to be on your game every second.\"\n\nWall Street analysts are also questioning Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) future following downbeat fiscal Q4 results. J.P. Morgan analyst Matthew recently said that increasing competition in the industry and Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) 18-month reset plan would leave it lagging behind peers, as he downgraded the stock to $6\n\n\"While we see secular health/wellness and casualization tailwinds providing Sportswear sector insulation, we see Under Armour lagging peers in terms of innovation, profitability, and DTC infrastructure,\" the analyst said.\n\nUnder Armour Inc Class A\u00a0(NYSE:UAA)\u00a0shares are down about 20% so far this year.\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on UAA, he's recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOf the 919 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 33 funds reported owning stakes in Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA). The biggest stake in Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA) is owned by Anand Parekh's Alyeska Investment Group which owns a $44 million stake in Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA).\n\nUnder Armour ranks 2nd in our list of the 7 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish On. \u00a0 \u00a0 If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "title": "Stocks to Buy: 7 Undeniable Dow Darlings to Pile Into Now",
        "content": "Investing in Dow stocks is always a reasonable strategy for those who value the American economy. The Dow Jones is composed of 30 prominent publicly listed U.S. firms. Those firms are large and tend to be leaders in their respective industries. Thus, an investment is a vote of confidence in American industry and the economy at large.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue that any of the\u00a030 stocks in the Dow are outright terrible. It\u2019s much easier to argue that a handful are particularly strong at any given time. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing in this article.\n\nThe stocks and companies discussed below have had varying degrees of success in 2024. Some are up by double digits while others are down nearly as much. But there\u2019s reason to believe that all will rise moving forward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a clear leader in artificial intelligence. The firm\u2019s early and strong investment in AI has paid dividends, propelling the stock much higher. However, investors may wonder if the majority of gains have already been gotten and whether it makes sense to sit Microsoft out at this point.\n\nThat would be a poor decision as AI spending is sure to increase from here. That increased spending is likely to come from congress. A bipartisan group of senators is advocating for $32 billion in emergency spending on AI. Those senators are working to find greater consensus across the aisle. The worry is that if they don\u2019t the U.S. will fall behind in relation to artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft is likely to be a big beneficiary of any such spending. Otherwise, investors should simply consider Microsoft because it is fundamentally very strong. Top-line growth reached 17% in the most recent quarter. It\u2019s difficult to find such a combination of size and growth elsewhere.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock is a strong investment in the budding weight-loss drug category. Investors know that Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) are the early leaders in that industry. However, a number of upcoming firms aim to chip away at their early dominance. Amgen is one of those firms.\n\nThe market knows this and has already reacted sending Amgen\u2019s stock higher in the first month of May. The best time to have been invested was prior to recent announcements but there is still reason to remain highly optimistic.\n\nThe reason to believe so lies in the advantages of Amgen\u2019s injectable drug, Maritide. It requires fewer injections than competitor drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Further, Maritide may produce greater weight loss than competitor drugs. Beyond that, Amgen may be better suited to produce large volumes of drugs. It\u2019s no secret that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have faced problems in that regard. However, Amgen is expected to do much better on that front.\n\nStory continues\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON) stock represents an industrial conglomerate well positioned for the future economy. Honeywell is highly notable for its position relative to automation of building and industry. When it comes to things like AI robots and the internet of things, Honeywell is a strong choice.\n\nSo, when those segments slow investors would generally expect Honeywell to grow weaker. That isn\u2019t actually the case based on recent results. While Honeywell\u2019s industrial and building automation segments did slow down in the most recent quarter, the company\u2019s aviation business more than made up for the slowing.$3.67 billion in sales from that unit helped the company beat guidance of $9.03 billion in sales that was expected.\n\nThe point here is simple: Honeywell is proving its resilience and strong balance overall. The company continues to be well positioned to take advantage of the automation trend but isn\u2019t fully dependent on it. Honeywell is a strong Dow stock and a great industrial share to consider for investors.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock has performed poorly in 2024, falling by more than 7%. Company management has been well aware of an emerging issue with the company\u2019s value platform, especially in light of rampant inflation.\n\nThe company proposed that franchisees bring back a $5 meal deal including four items earlier this year. The company again brought up the proposal this May as it has become more and more apparent that a consumer pullback is at hand. A few days later it was announced that the $5 meal deal will return for four weeks beginning in late June. The move should be a boon to the stock which has suffered due to stagnant results of late.\n\nCosts associated with the promotion will be largely borne by franchisees. That\u2019s why franchisees in high cost areas such as California had pushed back against the promotion earlier this year. It\u2019s done now. McDonald\u2019s has a chance to regain some of the market as a value option that it had lost. The stock has long been a strong performer and now\u2019s a good time to invest.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) stock continues to do well as the upper class strengthens and continues to do well itself. Retail spending has been very strong through the first of 4 months of 2024 which is reflected in American Express\u2019s earnings.\n\nEarnings jumped up by 39% during the first quarter reflecting the overall strength of American Express. The company caters to a more affluent customer base and for investors who believe that the rich will continue to get richer, American Express is a strong investment.\n\nThat notion certainly appears to be correct when it comes to credit card stocks. American Express has outperformed Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) this year and in the longer term as well. Visa and MasterCard cater to a less affluent customer base. Thus, there\u2019s a strong argument to be made in favor of American Express simply because of its customer base affluence. All three of the stocks are reasonable investments but I\u2019d argue that American Express is the clear leader.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock at the moment. It\u2019s relatively cheap at the moment and underappreciated. Cisco Systems also pays a very reliable dividend, yielding 3.2% currently. In addition, the company is transitioning to a more reliable sales base that should interest investors. That\u2019s a good place to start.\n\nCisco Systems recently closed its acquisition of Splunk which will push its sales mix decidedly in favor of software. That\u2019s important because software sales are recurring in nature. Thus, Cisco Systems\u00a0will benefit from a more stable and predictable revenue mix. The company is already proven to be very stable although it relied on more one-off hardware networking sales historically.\n\nInvestors should also note that Cisco Systems is very attractive on the basis of its forward P/E ratio. That ratio is lower than its already attractive trailing P/E ratio \u2014 suggesting that earnings will rise.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is the dominant force in customer relationship management. The stock has long benefited from that position.It should continue to strengthen moving forward for multiple reasons, one of which is its artificial intelligence investment.\n\nSalesforce is looking to acquire Informatica for roughly $11 billion. Salesforce is looking to buy the AI powered cloud data management vendor. The move should not be particularly surprising as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) is set to buy Salesforce competitor, HubSpot (NYSE:HUB).\n\nAnalysts argue that sales forces move better positions it for the AI opportunity over the coming decade. More specifically, It should help Salesforce to better integrate with data warehouses via AI.\n\nHowever, the deal will not come without substantial pushback from some Salesforce investors. the company faced a lot of pushback when it acquired Slack in 2021 for $28 billion. Nevertheless, Salesforce continues to dominate customer relationship management and is expected to grow rapidly this year and next.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Mcdonald's Franchisee Group Applauds $5 Value Meal, Urges For More Support\n\nAn independent group of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) franchisees has expressed support for the company\u2019s upcoming $5 value meal promotion, while also advocating for more backing from the corporation to ensure the discounted offering\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nAccording to a CNBC report on Tuesday, the National Owners Association (NOA), a franchisee advocacy group, penned a letter to its members stating, \u201cThe fact remains that to provide the consumer with more affordable options, they must be affordable for the owner/operators. McDonald\u2019s vast resources and financial investment are essential to any sustainable affordable strategy.\u201d\n\nTrending:\n\nA startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban and opens a round for regular investors at $250. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\nThe letter further described McDonald\u2019s business model as a \u201cpenny profit business, with 10-15% margins,\u201d and argued that there isn\u2019t enough profit to discount 30% for this model to be sustainable without a financial contribution from McDonald\u2019s.\n\nCNBC had previously reported that the $5 value meal, which includes a McChicken or McDouble, four-piece chicken nuggets, fries, and a drink, would be available from June 25 for about a month. This move comes as lower-income consumers are pulling back from certain restaurants due to persistent inflation, prompting brands to offer greater value to customers.\n\nThe NOA letter also suggested that McDonald\u2019s should continue to innovate on the menu, reintroducing items like snack wraps that use existing chicken breasts, and creating affordable options with lower food costs.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s declined to comment on the NOA letter. However, in a previous statement, the company noted that cash flows for U.S. franchisees have increased nearly 50% on average since 2018, making 2023 one of the best years for franchisee cash flow in the company\u2019s history.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nReddit user reveals his retirement account\u2019s \u201chourly wage\u201d \u2014 how much does your money really make per hour?

        "content": "If you\u2019re already retired, you must play the investment game differently than others.\u00a0Your main priority should be to protect the assets you already have while also\u00a0making sure\u00a0you have enough passive income\u00a0coming in\u00a0to make your retirement days as comfortable as possible.\n\nFirst,\u00a0this doesn\u2019t mean\u00a0you should put\u00a0all\u00a0your money into the stock market.\u00a0Even the safest stocks can crash in a downturn.\u00a0I think\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0wise to have\u00a0a good chunk of your money in bonds.\u00a0They have high yields right now; once interest rates come down, they\u2019ll be worth even more.\n\nNevertheless, stocks are still essential as reinvesting dividends, and capital gains can make them compound more efficiently in the long run. Let\u2019s examine three retirement stocks that strike the perfect balance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is by far my favorite pick when it comes to long-term dividend stocks.\u00a0While it is going through some tough times\u00a0right now, the stock has been\u00a0very\u00a0stable and consistent throughout its history.\u00a0It is\u00a0very\u00a0hard\u00a0not\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0drawn into a PepsiCo product if you walk down any snack aisle.\n\nThe growth here is far from over. Its international segment continues to perform very well. The\u00a0$36 billion international segment is expanding\u00a0at a brisk pace\u00a0while maintaining healthy profitability.\u00a0I\u2019m confident\u00a0this momentum can be sustained\u00a0given PepsiCo\u2019s focus markets like China and India.\n\nHowever, margins in the Frito-Lay North America business were\u00a0a bit\u00a0softer this reporting period.\u00a0The company expects these headwinds to ease going forward. The question remains whether PepsiCo will reinvest any potential savings to drive faster top-line growth or allow it to boost margins.\u00a0I believe\u00a0Frito-Lay margins can return to the lower 30% range, but the timing is still uncertain.\n\nRegardless, if you\u2019re a retiree, the short-term trends should\u00a0not matter much.\u00a0This business will continue to compound in the decades ahead, and it has a solid 3% dividend yield\u00a0to top it all off. PEP dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFlowers Foods (FLO) A hand holds a bag of Dave's Killer Bread at the grocery store\n\nSource: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) is\u00a0not as big as\u00a0Pepsi, but the trends have been\u00a0just\u00a0as safe.\u00a0Also, this stock is seeing some near-term weakness due to the broader economy not cooperating, but I\u00a0only\u00a0see this as an opportunity for the long run. The stock is already showing signs of a recovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere has been\u00a0growth in demand for some of their branded products, especially Dave\u2019s Killer Bread, which continues to attract more buyers each time.\n\nAdditionally, signs indicated that expenses were rising quicker than income.\u00a0Higher costs for staffing and technology\u00a0seem to be\u00a0cutting into the bottom line more than hoped.\u00a0Management aims to address this through changes and savings, but it\u2019s an area I\u2019ll be paying close attention to. The dividend yield is 3.8%.\n\nOn a brighter note,\u00a0it looks like\u00a0new prospects are being won over to Flowers Foods\u2019 offerings faster than projected. This extra business should help maximize the use of their facilities. I also see potential in their plans to upgrade warehouses and transportation fleets. While costly\u00a0at first, streamlining operations could serve them well in the long term.

Historically, McDonald\u2019s has weathered economic storms remarkably well. The stock gained 8.5% in 2008 as the S&P 500 plunged 37% during the Great Recession. And despite being a restaurant, McDonald\u2019s only saw a 3% revenue dip in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. The Golden Arches have earned their reputation as an all-weather stock.\n\nWhile the\u00a04.6% revenue growth to $6.17 billion slightly beat estimates, the earnings miss with EPS of $2.70 coming in $0.03 below expectations is concerning. Comps growth is actually negative in the U.S. However, this is due to broad-based consumer pressures that are affecting every company. The dividend\u00a0yields\u00a02.51%. In the long run, MCD is unlikely to disappoint.

        "title": "The new quiet luxury is burgers and fries: Over 60% of Americans are buying less fast food because it\u2019s just too expensive, survey finds",
        "content": "Move over, Herm\u00e8s and Miu Miu\u2014the newest luxury purse flying under the radar is a crinkled paper bag filled with burgers and greasy fries. The vast majority of Americans now find fast food way too expensive, dubbing it a \u201cluxury,\u201d a new report found.\n\nOf 2,000 American adults, 78% considered fast food a luxury because of its price tag, loan marketplace LendingTree found in a survey released Monday, using data from QuestionPro commissioned by ValuePenguin. Half of respondents said their own stretched financial situation made fast food feel like a luxury, and more than six in 10 said they had cut down on fast food because of rising prices.\n\n\u201cFast food often isn't this quick, cheap option anymore,\u201d LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz told Fortune over email. \u201cPeople are having sticker shock at the drive-thru, causing them to rethink how often they eat fast food.\u201d\n\nRespondents participated in the survey in early April\u2014the same time California\u2019s $20 minimum wage law for fast-food workers went into effect, causing chains like Chipotle to threaten 6%\u20137% increases in menu price. Even before the minimum wage law was enacted, consumers revolted against McDonald\u2019s $18 Big Mac meal and blasted Wendy\u2019s for its introduction of \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d in February, using AI to change menu item costs depending on the level of traffic during certain times of day. The burger chain backtracked the day after the announcement, saying it had no plans to raise prices, only provide discounts.\n\nIndeed, pinched consumers are most concerned about surge pricing, with 72% of those surveyed saying they would dine during off-hours if it meant cheaper menu items. Over half of respondents said they now cook at home if they\u2019re looking for a quick, cheap meal.\n\nStephen Zagor, food and restaurant consultant and adjunct assistant professor of business at the Columbia Business School, told Fortune that bad attitudes toward fast-food companies are an extension of the mentality so many have about the economy. As fast-food prices continue to rise even as inflation cools, consumer sentiment is dipping: In May, it reached its lowest point in six months.\n\n\u201cWe're in this inflationary mental cycle as much as we are an inflationary reality cycle,\u201d Zagor said.\n\n\u2018They hear the customers\u2019 pain\u2019\n\nBut there\u2019s good news on the horizon for customers feeling dejected by the state of fast-food prices, Zagor said. Burger chains are feeling pressure to make changes.\n\n\u201cThey hear the customers\u2019 pain, and they're trying to be responsive\u2014as they well should be,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s announced last week its plans to launch a $5 meal deal of a burger or chicken sandwich, fries, a four-piece nugget, and a drink. Wendy\u2019s responded similarly, rolling out a $3 breakfast deal with breakfast potatoes and a choice of bacon or sausage, egg, and cheese English muffin.\n\nThe changes came after fast-food chains noticed sales dips driven by choosy customers.\n\n\u201cThe consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during a call with investors this month. \u201cIt may be more pronounced with lower-income consumers, but it\u2019s important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value.\u201d\n\nWhile McDonald\u2019s is only promising its $5 meal deal for a month\u2014with franchisees asking the company to invest in the operation\u2014additional promotions are likely to stick around, though likely in different forms, such as app-exclusive deals or cheap menu add-ons for digital orders, Zagor said.\n\nFast-food companies are under pressure to keep their customers happy, even if it is initially a bigger lift for investors and the bottom line, he argued. A \u201crelationship-based\u201d business, the restaurant industry still has to promise its diners a return on the dining experience, even if it\u2019s just a quick drive-thru transaction. With over 70 million customers daily, chains like McDonald\u2019s are a cornerstone of people\u2019s lives, Zagor said, and they are under obligation to stay that way.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is, we love McDonald's. It's an American brand. It's who we are\u2014good or bad, hate it or love it, think it's healthy or unhealthy. It's who we are.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble\u2019s (NYSE:PG) market success and product demand reflect the company\u2019s steady organic sales growth rate. In Q3 2024, organic sales increased by 3%, which helped the company\u2019s total revenue growth. This steady increase in organic sales shows that P&G can take market share, extend its clientele, and successfully compete across various product categories.\n\nMoreover, Procter & Gamble also exhibits high profitability and operational efficiency, which support the company\u2019s robust bottom-line growth. Core gross margin and operating margin gains were the main drivers of the 11% rise in core profits per share over the previous year. Procter & Gamble may increase its sales profits by increasing its core operations\u2019 efficiency, indicating an operational edge and sharp cost control.\n\nFurther, Procter & Gamble\u00a0distributes cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, indicating its stability as a financial institution and confidence in its performance.

Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had an 11% increase\u00a0in operational revenue, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Pfizer\u2019s revenue growth\u00a0was\u00a0driven mainly\u00a0by its commercial execution. A targeted marketing strategy and a sharp global distribution of commercial field personnel aided this. Notably, in-line medicines like Vyndaqel, Eliquis, and Abrysvo, combined with acquired items from Seagen, contributed considerably to revenue growth.\n\nAdditionally, Pfizer\u2019s adjusted gross margin increased by 5.3% to 79.6% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Several reasons contributed to the notable increase in gross margin. These include\u00a0a favorable\u00a0sales mix brought about by Comirnaty\u2019s decreased sales volume, a product return adjustment for Paxlovid related to the U.S. government contract, and effective cost control throughout Pfizer\u2019s production network. This enhancement highlights Pfizer\u2019s emphasis on margin increase and cost control measures.\n\nFinally, Pfizer demonstrates fundamental business strength and capacity to hit financial obligations despite obstacles presented by the post-COVID environment by increasing its full-year adjusted diluted\u00a0EPS outlook by 10 cents.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFor 13 straight quarters, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has seen positive comparable sales growth. Comparable sales have increased by a solid 30% throughout the past four years. Global comparable sales rose by 1.9% in Q1 2024. The steadily increasing comparable sales growth reflects McDonald\u2019s sharp tactics to increase foot traffic and revenue in all\u00a0its markets. This pattern demonstrates McDonald\u2019s ability to keep customers happy and relevant even in difficult economic times.\n\nMoreover, consolidated revenues for the first quarter of this year were over\u00a0$6 billion, up 5% (or 4% in constant currency) from the year prior. For the last twelve-month period and the quarter, systemwide sales to loyalty members across 50 loyalty markets were close to $25 billion and over $6 billion. Hence, the steady increase in income shows that McDonald\u2019s can increase sales throughout its\u00a0worldwide network.\n\nTo sum up, sales to loyalty members across the system show how well loyalty programs work to increase consumer spending and engagement. Therefore, McDonald\u2019s demonstrates its endurance and market power by growing its revenue base despite economic difficulties.\n\nSafe-Haven Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) reported adjusted profits per share of adjusted profits pers share of $2.31, above the forecast midpoint by 11 cents. These results demonstrate the company\u2019s strong top and bottom lines. With total net sales of $12.3 billion, revenue was around $400 million higher than anticipated. Crucially, this overachievement was mostly ascribed to the growth platform of the ex-Humira, which had a revenue increase of over 15% during the quarter.\n\nAdditionally,\u00a0the ex-Humira growth platform has\u00a0mainly\u00a0driven AbbVie\u2019s revenue growth. Notably, in their fifth year on the market, drugs like Rinvoq and Skyrizi have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, Rinvoq generated over $1.1 billion in global sales, showing a\u00a061.9% operational increase. Meanwhile, Skyrizi\u2019s global sales hit $2 billion, reflecting 48% operational growth. The substantial rise observed in these essential items highlights AbbVie\u2019s capacity to create and promote efficacious treatments apart from its primary medication, Humira.\n\nLastly, AbbVie\u2019s strategic actions include the acquisition of ImmunoGen. This\u00a0helped the company enter the solid tumor market more quickly and fortify its oncology pipeline. Favorably, ImmunoGen\u2019s merger has gone well, which has helped the business develop overall.\n\nBritish American Tobacco (BTI) British American Tobacco logo on a building\n\nSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) gained over 3 million new customers in 2023 alone \u2014 a significant increase of 1.1 million. This increase broadens the consumer base and creates prospects for revenue development. Approximately 75% of new category revenue came from the top 10 new category markets, which showed rapid growth velocity. The category contribution margin in these areas is over 20%, demonstrating strong potential for generating income.\n\nFurthermore, British American Tobacco prioritizes continuous improvement projects to increase cost efficiency. By 2025, the company hopes to save at least \u00a31 billion more. These increases in efficiency support financial flexibility and lessen inflationary pressures. The corporation exits non-strategic areas and continuously assesses its stakeholders, such as ITC, as examples of\u00a0strategically evaluating its capital allocation and global footprint. Hence, British American Tobacco can increase value and optimize resource allocation through strategic realignment.\n\nFinally, British American Tobacco outlines achievable long-term financial goals, such as having\u00a050% of revenue from smokeless products by 2035. Thanks to this strategic vision, investors can now see and feel confident in BTI\u2019s development trajectory.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart\u2019s (NYSE:WMT) eCommerce sales increased significantly in Q1 2025, growing at 21% worldwide. Sales on the marketplace and store-fulfilled pickup and delivery were the main drivers of this rise. The company\u2019s omni-channel strategy is working, as seen by the marketplace and store-fulfilled pickup and delivery programs. These have a major positive impact on eCommerce growth. More marketplace offers and same-day delivery are just two new features that bolster its omni-channel capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, Walmart showed\u00a0good\u00a0inventory control by reducing its worldwide\u00a0inventory by 2.7%. In particular, Walmart U.S. decreased its inventory by 4.2%, demonstrating effective inventory turnover. The firm concentrated on improving the variety of products offered, especially for private brands, which increased gross margins. The first quarter saw a rise in private brand penetration, with grocery penetration at 0.30%.\n\nFinally, memberships in Walmart\u2019s membership programs, such as Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart Plus, have been growing by double digits. For example, Sam\u2019s Club U.S. saw record-breaking member penetration and counts, leading to a\u00a013% increase in membership revenue.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in JNJ, PG, PFE, and BTI.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search McDonald's Corporation (MCD): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which McDonald's falls in, has lost 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share, indicating a change of -2.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.17 points to a change of +1.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.18 indicates a change of +8.3% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MCD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.69 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. The $26.62 billion and $28.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.4% and +6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $2.70 for the same period compares with $2.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.01%. The EPS surprise was -0.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, McDonald's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Retirement Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows",
        "content": "Investing in retirement is different. Once out of the workforce and living on a fixed income, investors need to become more defensive to protect their nest egg. Taking positions in high-flying growth stocks and riding out periods of volatility is no longer the smart play. Once retired, investors need to strike a balance between growth and value stocks. Dividend payments that provide a consistent source of income or capital that can be reinvested are also important.\n\nOftentimes, the best retirement stocks are blue-chip names that offer a combination of safety, growth and income. While not the most exciting securities to own, these retirement stocks help investors ride out market instability and ensure their finances are secure. Fortunately, several leading blue-chip stocks would be great retirement investments and are available to buy on a dip right now.\n\nHere are three retirement stocks to buy at a 52-week low.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) are down nearly 10% this year and down 6% over the past 12 months. Not far from its 52-week low, now would be a good time for long-term investors to pick up shares of the Golden Arches. The blue-chip stock has consistently been one of the best retirement stocks that investors can own. Moreover, a reason to buy McDonald\u2019s stock comes from its dividend.\n\nLast autumn, McDonald\u2019s raised its dividend payment by 10%. The company now pays stockholders a dividend of $1.67 per share each quarter. McDonald\u2019s stock has a dividend yield of 2.45% based on the current share price. Over the last decade, the company has more than doubled its annual dividend payment to $6.68 a share from $3.08. McDonald\u2019s paid its first dividend in 1976 and has increased it every year since.\n\nThe company has struggled over the past year with inflation and higher menu prices that have driven some customers away. But long term the company will be fine. It recently announced the return of its $5 value meals.\n\nNike (NKE)\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nSneaker and athletic apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) continues to struggle. Down nearly 15% on the year, NKE stock is hovering right around its 52-week low and is currently one of the worst performers in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. Patient long-term investors might want to buy the dip. Like McDonald\u2019s, Nike continues to dominate the sector in which it operates, commanding more than 30% of the global market for athletic footwear and clothing, more than any other company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso like the Golden Arches, Nike pays a decent dividend to its stockholders. The company currently pays 37 cents a share each quarter, giving the stock a yield of 1.61%. Not the biggest dividend around, but consistent and sustainable. The company has paid a dividend since 1985 and increased it in each of the past 15 years. Though Nike has been struggling lately with rising competition and a sales slowdown in China, it remains dominant due in large part to its endorsements of star athletes.\n\nMost recently, Nike announced that it is signing WNBA basketball star Caitlin Clark to a $28 million endorsement deal.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nPatient investors might want to bottom fish the stock of microchip and semiconductor company Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Down 33% so far this year, INTC stock is currently the worst-performing stock in both the Dow 30 and the benchmark S&P 500 index. That\u2019s because the company continues to struggle with its efforts to expand its microchip manufacturing for its customers.\n\nWhile things look bleak right now, there are some reasons for retirement-oriented investors to consider a long-term investment in INTC stock. The company pays a quarterly dividend of 13 cents a share, giving its stock a yield of 1.57%, which is in line with other tech stocks. The current valuation also looks attractive, with Intel\u2019s stock trading close to a 52-week low. Furthermore, the company recently received $8.5 billion from the U.S. government to help with its pivot to becoming a foundry.\n\nIt will take time, but if the goal is to buy low and eventually sell high, then INTC stock looks interesting at current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As a result, some companies will suffer from this situation, while others will benefit, providing investors with new ideas for stocks to buy and sell.\n\n\u201c\u2018The lower income consumer in the U.S. is stretched,\u2019 PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said late last month when reporting better profit than expected, and \u2018is strategizing a lot to make their budgets get to the end of the month. And that\u2019s a consumer that is choosing what to buy, where to buy, and making a lot of choices.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski recently said, consumers of all income demographics are more selective about spending their hard-earned money.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat presents opportunities for investors. It also warns those holding shares in companies that are losing market share because of consumer caution.\u00a0With consumers struggling, here are two stocks to buy and one to sell that are winning and losing.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) reported exceptional Q1 2024 results on May 16, sending its shares higher, hitting an all-time high of $64.88.\n\nOn the top line, its revenues were $161.51 billion, more than $2 billion higher than analyst expectations, with earnings per share of 60 cents, eight cents higher than the consensus. Even better, it now sees 2024 sales increasing at the high end of its previous 3-4% guidance, or perhaps even above that. On the bottom line, it initially projected full-year adjusted EPS of $2.30 at the midpoint of its guidance, but it now feels it will be above that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got customers that are coming to us more frequently than they have before and newer customers that we haven\u2019t traditionally had, and they\u2019re coming into a Walmart whether it\u2019s a virtual store online, or whether it\u2019s one of our physical stores,\u201d CNBC reported comments from Walmart CFO John David Rainey.\n\nWhile there is no empirical evidence, I often go to Walmart to buy cat litter, and the number of high-end vehicles in the parking lot seems higher than in previous years.\n\nThere is no question Walmart thrives in this kind of economic environment.\n\nDollarama (DLMAF) Dollarama logo in front of their local shop in downtown Montreal, Quebec.\n\nSource: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second of two stocks to buy is Dollarama (OTCMKTS:DLMAF), the largest operator of dollar stores in Canada with 1,551 stores.\n\nWhy Dollarama and not Dollar General (NYSE:DG) or Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)?\n\nFirst, it faces less competition in the $5 and under marketplace. For example, in the U.S., Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) sells products to tweens, teens, and adults priced between $1 and $5, with some above that in its Five Beyond offering. We (I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia) don\u2019t have that nationally in Canada.\u00a0The second reason is Dollarama\u2019s investment in the South American value market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt first entered into a commercial partnership with Dollarcity in February 2013 to provide its expertise and sourcing services to the company. Dollarama had an option to buy 50.1% starting in the seventh year of the partnership. As of June 30, 2020, Dollarama would pay five times its 12-month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).\n\nDollarama closed the deal on Aug. 15, 2019, paying $40 million down and the remaining $52.7 million in Q3 2021 (Nov. 1, 2020).\u00a0As of Sept. 30, 2020, Dollarcity had 240 stores, 127 in Colombia, 64 in Guatemala, and 49 in El Salvador. As of Dec. 31, 2023, it had 532 stores, more than double in 2020 when the deal closed.\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront. Peloton layoffs\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) hit an all-time low of $2.70 on May 2. Its shares are up 45% in the three weeks since as a result of speculation, private equity firms are sniffing around to pick up the business on the cheap.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a surprise that Peloton has imploded.\n\nIn my experience, selling expensive sporting goods equipment such as treadmills and ellipticals is a losing proposition in the long haul because only so many people will spend $1,400 or more for equipment that will sit in your basement or spare bedroom.\n\nBack in May 2020, I wrote a piece about Peloton suggesting its business was somewhere between Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Nautilus, the former owner of Bowflex, which was acquired for just $37.5 million in April.\n\nHowever, in hindsight, I was too kind about Peloton\u2019s business, which traded around $42 at the time of my article.\n\n\u201cWhile Peloton is definitely not the next Nike, I do think it\u2019s got a much better business model than Wayfair (NYSE:W), which may never make money,\u201d I wrote in 2020.\n\n\u201cAs the professor said, Peloton should make money someday. But I don\u2019t see it becoming the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). That said, I also don\u2019t see it becoming the next Nautilus.\u201d\n\nIf it were solely a software business, Peloton might have a shot at survival. Unfortunately, its hardware business will kill it.\n\nIt\u2019s a stock to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As we approach mid-2024, investors are eagerly searching for the best value stocks to buy. These are typically well-established companies with solid financials, strong brand recognition and a history of consistent dividend payments.\n\nRecent economic indicators suggest a favorable environment for value stocks, with a rebounding economy and the prospects of lower inflation. Moreover, savvy investors can look beyond traditional financial metrics such as innovation, market expansion, and management execution. By strategically selecting value stocks with a strong growth trajectory, investors can position themselves to benefit from substantial returns.\n\nNow, here are the top value stocks to buy in May!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), a consumer giant with a portfolio of household brands like Tide, Pampers and Gillette, is a classic example of a value stock. Its strong brand loyalty and extensive distribution network provide a competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate.\n\nIn recent years, PG has demonstrated resilience in the face of rising inflationary pressures. Its ability to remain profitable and grow its dividend through various economic cycles is a testament to its robust business model. The company\u2019s focus on innovation and geographical diversification has also contributed to its sustained growth. In their latest quarterly results, revenue increased a modest 1% YOY. However, EPS grew 11% from the year prior, while generating operating cash flow of $4.1 billion. PG stock is also a dividend aristocrat, offering a yield of around 2.4%. They have increased their dividend for 68 consecutive years, and paid out dividends for 134 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890. This makes PG stock one of the top value stocks to buy in May.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) A sign for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM).\n\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), one of the world\u2019s largest banks, is another value stock worth considering for explosive gains in May. Despite the challenges in the banking sector and economy in 2024, JPM\u2019s liquidity remains best in class.\n\nJPMorgan has consistently delivered strong financial results over the years. More recently, they have benefited tremendously from the higher interest rate environment in the U.S. Higher interest rates on deposits for credit cards, mortgages and lines of credit is great news for large banks like JPM. This led to record net interest income in the 2023 fiscal year, and rate remaining higher for longer could be another positive tailwind in 2024. On May 20th, CEO Jamie Dimon, warned investors on the economic risks in the economy and his future succession plans. They have also raised their net interest income forecast to $91 billion, up from the $89 billion forecast for FY24.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp (NYSE:MCD) is the world\u2019s largest fast food chain and one of the most compelling value stocks to buy for 2024. Despite rising criticism among consumers and Wall Street, the company\u2019s long term growth trajectory remains intact.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has largely underperformed the broader market this year with the stock down nearly 10%, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 12% increase. Wall Street has turned increasingly bearish, as consumers push back on rising prices. In recent years, MCD has undergone a transformation, focusing on improving its menu, and enhancing customer experience. These efforts have paid off, as evidenced by the record earnings results in FY 2023. In Q1 FY 2024, MCD comparable sales grew 2% YOY marking its 13 consecutive quarter of growth. Profitability also increased during the quarter, with net earnings up 7% to $1.95 billion. With a global expansion underway and strong dividend growth potential, MCD stock remains one of the best value stocks to buy in May for long term gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the past, adding coffee to the menu was an easy way to juice sales. A few years ago amid lagging doughnut sales, Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) thought by pushing coffee with its glazed confections could have the beverage grow to 10% of sales.\n\nAccording to the National Coffee Association, 67% of Americans drink at least one cup of coffee in the past day and 75% in the past week. The biggest growth market is by consumers 25 years and older. Also, the 60-and-older crowd had the greatest jump, from 67% having a cup in the past day to 73%.\n\nYet inflation is taking its toll. Although coffee prices are down 18% from the recent highs hit in March, they remain 7% above where they were a year ago. They are triple the price at which they traded five years ago. This weighs heavily on all the major coffee chains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCustomer store visits recovered to above pre-pandemic levels. But according to location intelligence data specialist Placer.ai, all the outlets mentioned inflation, commodity costs or pricing actions they had to take to compensate.\n\nCoffee remains one the most popular U.S. beverages with consumption at a 20-year high. Let\u2019s dive into the three most popular, publicly traded coffee stocks you can buy today.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is synonymous with coffee. The restaurant has millions of ardent and loyal fans flocking to its stores. Yet, it has run into trouble with the casual consumer, the customer who only occasionally visits a Starbucks store.\n\nAs inflation ravages the consumer\u2019s wallet, the casual customer has cut back on discretionary spending. That often means reducing the number of Starbucks visits.\n\n\u201cA deteriorating economic outlook has weighed on customer traffic,\u201d Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Laxman Narasimhan said.\n\nComparable store visits were down 3% in the U.S. in the first quarter and were off 6% internationally. The number of transactions were down as well, 7% and 3%, respectively. At least in the U.S., the average ticket price was up 4%,. This is a reflection of increased pricing by Starbucks due to inflation and soaring coffee bean prices.\n\nStarbucks stock was crushed in the meantime and remains 13% below where it stood before the Q1 report. It makes the coffee company attractively valued. SBUX stock trades at an historically low 20 times earnings and at a price-to-sales ratio it hasn\u2019t seen in the last 10 years.\n\nDutch Bros (BROS) A Dutch Bros coffee shop representing BROS Stock.\n\nSource: Alexander Oganezov / Shutterstock.com\n\nHigher input costs have also worn down drive-thru coffee chain Dutch Bros (NASDAQ:BROS). While coffee bean prices are down since the beginning of the year, the company doesn\u2019t expect pricing to change much for the remaining 2024. Also, it\u2019s keeping an eye on sugar and cocoa prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latter, in particular, went stratospheric this year, soaring 300% above last year\u2019s levels. They are still double the price today even as they\u2019ve fallen 34% from last month. The volatility will wreak havoc with Dutch Bros\u2019 top and bottom lines.\n\nPlacer.ai, though, notes the upstart coffee chain has seen the greatest traffic increases amongst the various chains. Visits increased 177% in 2023 primarily as a result of the \u201cexponential\u201d increase in the number of new locations opening.\n\nFurther, Dutch Bros adopted the \u201cfortressing\u201d strategy popularized by pizza chain Domino\u2019s (NYSE:DPZ). The method calls for flooding a market with new stores to build mindshare amongst consumers while saving on marketing costs. Although the individual store economics may suffer from cannibalization, overall sales to the company rise.\n\nFirst quarter sales surged 39% from last year, but importantly, comps were 10% higher. Dutch Bros stock is up 18% year-to-date (YTD), though shares trade at some pricey valuations. However, analysts see the coffee chain growing earnings by 28% annually, so it might just grow into that valuation.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nThe granddaddy of coffee chains is McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). Although its burgers are the primary attraction, the McDonald\u2019s breakfast menu is still a key component of the restaurant\u2019s overall growth. Coffee is a prime reason the morning daypart represents a third of total sales. Additionally, McDonald\u2019s has a 35% share of the breakfast market.\n\nIndeed, Placer.ai says foot traffic to McDonald\u2019s \u201cremained consistently strong over the past year, with the chain generally outperforming the wider Quick-Service Restaurant (QSR) and posting positive visit growth almost every month.\u201d\n\nMoreover, McDonald\u2019s launched a new chain called CosMc\u2019s that is designed to compete against rival coffee and beverage chains. So far the results look promising as it gives McDonald\u2019s an entry into the evening beverage business. According to the location intelligence data specialist, CosMc\u2019s got 40.2% of late afternoon and evening visits, better than McDonald\u2019s itself at 36.4%, but also Dunkin\u2019 (24.7%) and Starbucks (18.3%).\n\nWith more CosMc\u2019s planned to open across the country, McDonald\u2019s could own some of the most important dayparts of the restaurant business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "With 72% ownership of the shares, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in McDonald's implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 25 shareholders own 43% of the company Recent sales by insiders\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 72% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for McDonald's  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nMcDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in McDonald's. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.0% and 4.8% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of McDonald's\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that McDonald's Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$413m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in McDonald's. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with McDonald's , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

        "title": "The AI Stock Underdogs: 7 Underappreciated Companies Poised for Greatness",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has taken over business headlines for good reason. Yet, investors may be better served, at this juncture, focusing on underappreciated AI stocks. Why? Primarily, it comes down to the impact of a crowded trade.\n\nYes, you can pile your funds into the usual suspects such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the market never sees assets rise in perfectly linear fashion indefinitely because it\u2019s difficult to sustain rising expectations. That\u2019s especially the case for Nvidia. With so many blistering earnings performances, at some point, it will miss.\n\nWe don\u2019t know when that miss will occur. So, it\u2019s a financial game of Russian roulette.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the other hand, hidden gems in the AI space could have longer legs, mainly because so few expect them to do anything. By opening the doors to non-tech enterprises, investors may be able to enjoy surprising profits. With that, below are underappreciated AI stocks to buy.\n\nWalmart (WMT) The blue, white, and yellow Walmart (WMT) logo is being displayed on a small rectangle sign in the grass.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), chances are, AI isn\u2019t the first thing that comes to mind. However, it\u2019s a clear beneficiary of digital intelligence. For example, the big-box retailer has started incorporating conversation AI into its business. With its voice shopping interface, customers can shop as fast as they can talk and text.\n\nFinancially, it\u2019s a consistent performer, allowing investors the ability to sleep easy at night. In the four quarters since the period ending April 30, 2024, Walmart\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 7.88%. It\u2019s not an astounding print but it gets the job done.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts are looking at earnings per share of $2.38 on revenue of $674.53 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $2.22 on sales of $648.12 billion. In the following year, these metrics could improve to earnings of $2.61 per share on sales of $700.54 billion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not exciting, the reliability factor makes WMT one of the underappreciated AI stocks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) isn\u2019t exactly a technology player. However, it\u2019s one of the underappreciated AI stocks thanks to the underlying deployment of the innovation. Last year, the Golden Arches made news when it opened a new automated restaurant in Texas. Rather than the traditional means of picking up orders, customers can take advantage of a conveyer-belt-fed system.\n\nOn a financial note, McDonald\u2019s is very appealing because of its consistency. Yes, in the first quarter of 2024, the company incurred a small miss regarding its bottom-line target. However, in the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.93%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate EPS of $12.20 on sales of $26.62 billion. That\u2019s a sizable improvement over last year\u2019s results of $11.15 EPS on revenue of $23.82 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 could see the bottom line rise to $13.28 per share with a top line of $28.14 billion. With a decent forward dividend yield of 2.45%, MCD ranks among the underappreciated AI stocks.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) makes sense in any context because of a cynical reality: people must eat. But KR is also one of the underappreciated AI stocks. Not too long ago, the company announced AI capabilities to its online marketplace. This new interface should give Kroger customers a superior experience via more informative product listings.\n\nOn a financial level, a key reason for investing in KR stock is the underlying consistency. In the past four quarters since the period ending Jan. 31, 2024, the grocer\u2019s positive average earnings surprise clocked in at 7.98%. On a trailing-12-month basis, Kroger features a net income of $2.15 billion. Its profit margin comes in at 1.44%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are seeking EPS of $4.42 on revenue of $148.73 billion. That\u2019s a downgrade from last year\u2019s results of $4.76 EPS on sales of $150.04 billion. However, there could be a gradual improvement to earnings of $4.55 per share on sales of $151.36 billion in the following year.\n\nDeere (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most important companies due to its relevance to the agriculture industry, Deere (NYSE:DE) also ranks among underappreciated AI stocks. A key innovation that the company forwarded is its autonomous tractor. First, such autonomy may offer force multiplication for farmers. Second, because fewer people are interested in a farming career, these smart tractors could address sector labor shortages.\n\nFor investors, DE stock has attracted demand due to the pertinence to a critical ecosystem. Also, it\u2019s a consistent performer. Since fiscal Q1, Deere\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to just under 16%. That\u2019s mighty impressive. Also, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 1.48%.\n\nMoving forward, analysts anticipate a tricky narrative, with EPS coming down to $26.81 on sales of $48.08 billion by the end of this year. That compares disappointingly to 2023\u2019s print of $34.69 EPS on revenue of $55.56 billion. Still, with the consistently robust performances recently, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking to see Deere prove doubters wrong again.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA healthcare juggernaut, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the most trusted investments for the long haul. It also happens to be one of the underappreciated AI stocks. Notably, the company earned a spot in Fast Company\u2019s 2022 \u201cMost Innovative Companies\u201d list. One featured innovation was J&J\u2019s AI-powered C-SATS platform, which allows surgeons to connect any operating room to the cloud.\n\nAside from a small miss in Q2 2023, the healthcare giant has been consistent with its earnings performances. In the past four quarters, its average positive surprise came out to 1.6%. It\u2019s not the most exciting enterprise, that much is certain. However, the focus on building the bottom line allows the company to offer a forward dividend yield of 3.21%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate EPS to rise to $10.65 on sales of $88.35 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $9.92 on revenue of $85.16 billion. In fiscal 2025, these metrics could improve to earnings of $10.95 per share with a top line of $90.74 billion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cybersecurity specialist, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) happens to be a great example of underappreciated AI stocks. Primarily, the focus of digital intelligence centers on \u201caccretive\u201d endeavors; that is, directives that enhance productivity. At the same time, AI could be a force multiplier for nefarious online activities. Therefore, Palo Alto\u2019s AI-focused cybersecurity protocol is a necessity in keeping enterprises safe from harm.\n\nNot surprisingly, the company benefits from robustly consistent performances. In the past four quarters since the period ending Jan. 31, Palo Alto\u2019s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 15.53%. On a TTM basis, net income stands at $2.28 billion. Its profit margin is a stout 30.24%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that EPS will rise to $5.51 on sales of $7.98 billion. That\u2019s a big step from last year\u2019s results of earnings of $4.44 per share on revenue of $6.89 billion. For fiscal 2025, EPS of $6.16 with a top line of $9.13 billion may be in the cards. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the underappreciated AI stocks to consider.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA software firm, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is best known for its TurboTax program. That\u2019s going to be significant moving forward as the gig economy may attract workers. If so, people will transition from being employees to independent contractors and that imposes a more complex tax structure. Invariably, those new to working for themselves will have questions. Here, generative AI can help.\n\nAs an investment, INTU stock is attractive for consistently (and handily) beating its quarterly bottom-line targets. In the past four quarters, Intuit\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 14.9%. On a TTM basis, its net income stand at $2.77 billion. Further, its profit margin clocks in at 18.35%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS of $16.41 on sales of $16.05 billion. Last year, the company posted earnings of $14.40 per share on revenue of $14.37 billion. In fiscal 2025, these metrics could improve to $18.85 EPS with a top line of $18.05 billion. With a potentially expanding total addressable market, Intuit makes for one of the underappreciated AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald\u2019s Stock (NYSE:MCD): Growth Slowdown Isn\u2019t a Concern. Here\u2019s Why",
        "content": "McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) showed signs of a slowdown in its Q1 results, leading to shares sliding lower in recent weeks. While the company entered FY2024 with a softer growth trajectory compared to last year, I don\u2019t believe this necessarily sets a new trend. With this year\u2019s numbers facing tough comps from FY2023, a breather in McDonald\u2019s growth is to be expected. In the meantime, a rebound is likely to occur from FY2025 onwards, suggesting that the recent stock dip offers a buying opportunity. Thus, I am bullish on MCD stock.\n\nFirst-Quarter Results Face Tough Comps\n\nThe most important factor to recognize when looking at this year\u2019s first-quarter results is that McDonald\u2019s faces tough comps from FY2023. Last year\u2019s promotions, smart pricing strategies against inflation, and very soft comps from FY2022 resulted in strong revenue growth. This year, the company will likely take a breather as it consolidates last year\u2019s revenues and earnings. This doesn\u2019t mean, however, that no growth will occur this year. In fact, FY2024 is expected to be another year of record revenues and earnings.\n\nTaking a deeper look at McDonald\u2019s first-quarter numbers, the most disappointing figure at first glance appears to be the rather lackluster same-store sales growth. It came in at just 1.9%, leading to total sales growth of just 4%. These are notably weaker numbers compared to the high-single-digit same-store and total sales growth figures we were used to seeing last year.\n\nNevertheless, McDonald\u2019s performance was quite strong in the right context. Q1 celebrated McDonald\u2019s 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth, including 30% growth over the last four years.\n\nIn other words, McDonald\u2019s sustained outstanding growth momentum during the past four years\u2014some of the best years in its history. The fact that the company has not seen a temporary pullback but instead consolidates its current revenue levels is quite outstanding, in my view. Evidently, demand for its burgers and fries remains at all-time-high levels, defying saturation despite its, let\u2019s say, impulsive expansion in recent years.\n\nRecord Financials in FY2024, Growth to Rebound in FY2025\n\nBesides the fact that McDonald\u2019s first-quarter growth was strong in the right context, another factor that investors seem to have been ignoring these past few weeks is that the company is still set to deliver record financials in FY2024. Even more importantly, a rebound in growth is also expected to take place in FY2025.\n\nIn particular, the company ended the quarter with 42,018 restaurants, 3.7% more than in the same period last year. Its location count continues to expand, which, along with low-single-digit same-store growth, will likely result in meaningful total revenue growth for the year. Consensus revenue estimates point to a record $26.65 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 4.5%. When it comes to earnings per share, the market expects softer year-over-year growth of 2.2%, yet this still implies a record figure of $12.20.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, Wall Street expects a rebound in revenue and earnings growth in the medium term to the mid-to-high single digits, mirroring last year\u2019s rebound over the equivalent slowdown that occurred in FY2022.\n\nThe Valuation Signals a Potential Buying Opportunity\n\nInvestors often complain that they hesitate to buy McDonald\u2019s stock because it continuously trades at a premium. Well, the stock\u2019s recent dip seems to have opened up a buying opportunity, as shares are likely undervalued against the company\u2019s future growth estimates and McDonald\u2019s overall qualities.\n\nAt 22.4x this year\u2019s expected earnings-per-share and 20.6x next year\u2019s figure, the stock appears to be trading at the low end of its five-year range of 20-30x.\n\nOne argument against this point is that interest rates remain high, hampering the stock\u2019s investment case. However, seeing that most quality companies have retained rich multiples in this environment, I don\u2019t see McDonald\u2019s valuation getting notably compressed from its current levels.\n\nIs MCD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLooking at Wall Street\u2019s view on the stock, McDonald\u2019s features a Moderate Buy consensus rating. This is based on 19 Buy and nine Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. At $306.17, the\u00a0average\u00a0MCD stock forecast suggests 12.85% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell MCD stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is David Palmer\u00a0from Evercore ISI, with an average return of 15.03% per rating and an 86% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTo sum up, McDonald\u2019s sales growth slowdown in its Q1 results, though concerning at first glance, is better understood within the context of tough comps from last year. While same-store sales growth may have dipped, the fact that the company sustains its abruptly higher sales levels and even keeps growing past them is a testament to the quality of its business model.\n\nIn fact, with financials set to hit new records in FY2024 and a projected rebound in growth for FY2025, the recent stock dip likely signals a buying opportunity.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "McDonald's Corporation MCD is benefiting from increasing comparable sales on the back of its focus on loyalty programs, expansion efforts and affordable menu offerings.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s 2024 earnings per share is pegged at $12.17, depicting 1.9% growth from the prior year\u2019s reported levels. MCD delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.4%, on average. The positive trend signifies bullish analysts\u2019 sentiments, robust fundamentals and the chances of an outperformance in the near term.\r\n\r\nShares of MCD have dwindled 7.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry\u2019s 2.9% decline. Over the past month, the stock has demonstrated resilience, showing a modest 1% improvement.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s prospects are hindered by ongoing inflationary pressures, especially commodity and labor inflation. Also, the negative impact of geopolitical tension in the Middle East market is an additional headwind. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper and analyze the factors.\n\nWhat Makes the Stock Attractive\n\nLoyalty Program Bodes Well: McDonald's continuously seeks opportunities to enhance its top-tier loyalty program. Upon the launch of its loyalty program, the company has been able to transform its offerings across drive-thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in. The program has not only helped in retaining the existing customers but also in expanding the customer base. During the first quarter 2024, the company declared loyalty system-wide sales of more than $6 billion and approximately $25 billion in the trailing 12-month period.\r\n\r\nAlso, during the quarter, MCD revealed its expectation to deploy \u201cReady on Arrival\u201d, which is a digital enhancement initiative in the United States, to boost its loyalty program participants and encourage customers to avail the digital platform. This initiative is expected to be launched across the top six markets by 2025-end. Given a rise in digital adoption, the company is optimistic about reaching 90-day active users to 250 million and $45 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales by 2027.\r\n\r\nFootprint Expansion Plans: Being a globally operating fast-food chain, McDonald's is always considering its investment opportunities regarding the expansion to new as well as existing markets. Despite unfavorable global economic scenarios, the company continues to expand its global footprint, which can be evidenced by the opening of its 6,000th restaurant in China during the first quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nThe company is planning to open more than 2,100 new restaurants globally in 2024, including 500 openings in the United States and IOM segment and 1,600 (including nearly 1000 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market. The new unit growth aim showcases about 4% contribution to new unit growth (net of closures). Also, the company expects net restaurant unit expansion to contribute nearly 2% to 2024 systemwide sales growth. It targets to open 50,000 restaurants by 2027.\r\n\r\nBudget Menu Offerings: Apart from diversifying its menu items or adding new ones, MCD focuses on offering pocket-friendly menu items. This strategic move is undertaken after consideration of its customer\u2019s demand patterns and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. The company aims to deliver scrumptious meals at affordable pricing, thus gaining the confidence of its customer base.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 earnings call, the company declared high returns from its McSmart menu in Germany, reporting strong performance with record units sold. The McSmart value menu has been now been established in France and is driving progress in the market\u2019s business trends. Furthermore, McDonald\u2019s\u2019 Everyday Value menu continued to drive results during the quarter in markets including Spain.\n\nStory continues\n\nFactors Hindering Growth\n\nHigh-Cost Environment: McDonald\u2019s is facing headwinds in the form of increased inflationary pressures and this scenario is expected to continue for some time. During the first quarter, McDonald\u2019s company-operated restaurant expenses were $2.04 billion, up 6% from $1.92 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates, remains headwinds.\r\n\r\nGiven the ongoing inflationary headwinds, the company expects the operating margin to remain pressurized in the near term. It expects commodity and food and paper inflation to be at the higher end in 2024. Also, it expects labor inflation to be in the high single digits.\n\nKey Picks\n\nHere are some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector.\r\n\r\nWingstop Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Oracle Corp. ORCL, Bank of America Corp. BAC, McDonald's Corp. MCD, Miller Industries, Inc. MLR and Via Renewables, Inc. VIA.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Oracle, Bank of America and McDonald's\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Oracle Corp., Bank of America Corp. and McDonald's Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks Miller Industries, Inc. and Via Renewables, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nOracle shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+16.1% vs. +10.1%). The company is gaining from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings. The solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well.\r\n\r\nOracle\u2019s Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL\u2019s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. The company\u2019s partnership with Microsoft and Nvidia is noteworthy. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 6.3% from 2023.\r\n\r\nHowever, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain, is likely to limit margin expansion.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Bank of America have gained +16.3% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry\u2019s gain of +17.8%. The company\u2019s first-quarter 2024 results were aided by strength in the investment banking (IB) business. While higher funding costs are a concern, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) will likely be positively impacted in the current high-rate environment.\r\n\r\nThe opening of financial centers and improved digital capabilities will support the top line. While the capital markets activity improved of late, the challenging macroeconomic environment might once again weigh on the IB business. Due to investments in franchise, overall costs will remain high.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)\r\n\r\nMcDonald's shares have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the year-to-date period (-7.1% vs. -2.4%). The company\u2019s increased costs and expenses negatively impacted the first quarter\u2019s bottom line. McDonald\u2019s expectation of increased commodity and labor inflation is concerning for its prospects.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the top and bottom lines increased year over year by 5% and 2%, respectively. The company\u2019s results showcase increasing global comparable sales and systemwide sales to loyalty members.\r\n\r\nThe uptrend was backed by average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases, effective marketing campaigns, along with continued digital and delivery growth. Also, its focus on Accelerating the Arches strategy is encouraging.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on McDonald\u2019s here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Miller Industries have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Original Equipment industry over the past year (+76.7% vs. -10.4%). The company showcases strong growth, with Q1 2024 revenues hitting $349.9 million, up 24% year over year, driven by increased demand and chassis shipments. Gross profit rose 45.5% to $44.2 million, with margins expanding to 12.6% due to enhanced manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe firm boosts shareholder value with a 5.6% dividend increase and a $25 million share repurchase plan, reflecting confidence in its financial stability and long-term strategy. Positioned as a leader in the growing global towing equipment market, Miller benefits from its broad product range and strong brand while continuing to innovate, like their patented LCG design in car carriers.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include intense competition, volatile raw material costs, regulatory uncertainties, and reliance on specific market sectors, posing risks to profitability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Miller Industries here >>>)\r\n\r\nVia Renewables\u2019 shares have gained +24.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry\u2019s gain of +36.3%. The company demonstrates robust customer growth, adding 41,000 RCEs in first-quarter 2024, reaching 338,000. This, coupled with a recent acquisition of 12,500 RCEs, indicates effective growth strategies.\r\n\r\nFinancially, VIA rebounded with a first-quarter net income of $19.1 million, reversing a previous loss in the prior-year quarter on favorable hedge gains. VIA boosted its net cash from operations in the first quarter, signaling improved efficiency and capital management.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges persist with a decrease in adjusted EBITDA and retail gross margins, primarily in the electricity and natural gas segments. Rising G&A expenses and high competition, alongside customer acquisition costs, further pressure profitability.

        "title": "McDonald's plans $5 US meal deal next month to counter customer frustration over high prices",
        "content": "McDonald\u2019s plans to introduce a $5 meal deal in the U.S. next month to counter slowing sales and customers\u2019 frustration with high prices.\n\nThe deal would let customers get a four-piece McNugget, small fries, a small drink and either a McDouble burger or a McChicken sandwich for $5 in most areas, according to a person familiar with the deal who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss its details.\n\nThe month-long deal is scheduled to begin June 25 and will be advertised nationally. Some stores with higher costs, like those in California or Hawaii, may charge more, the person said.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t confirm the upcoming deal when asked about it Thursday by The Associated Press. But the Chicago-based burger giant said last month that it was planning to step up deals to combat slowing customer traffic in some markets.\n\n\u201cWe know how much it means to our customers when McDonald\u2019s offers meaningful value and communicates it through national advertising,\u201d McDonald's said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe meal deal would be a substantial discount from the list prices for the items that will be included in the limited-time deal. One McDonald\u2019s location in Michigan charged $9.66 for the four items sold individually on Thursday.\n\nFast food prices have risen dramatically in the last few years due to a variety of factors, including elevated costs for labor, food and paper products. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2024, the amount spent per person per visit at a U.S. fast food restaurant rose 25%, from $12 to $15, according to Technomic, a restaurant data firm.\n\nMcDonald's said earlier this year that it was seeing fewer U.S. visits and lower spending from customers earning less than $45,000 per year.\n\nAs grocery inflation has slowed, more people are choosing to eat at home, McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said. In the first quarter, the company said fast food traffic was flat or down in many key markets, including the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar,\u201d Kempczinski said during a conference call with investors. \u201cIt may be more pronounced with lower-income consumers, but its important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value.\u201d\n\nDuring the same call, Kempczinski said McDonald's needed a nationwide deal emphasizing its value if it wanted to keep up with rivals.\n\nOther chains have also reported slowing sales. Starbucks said last month that it was seeing a sharper and faster decline in U.S. consumer confidence than it had anticipated in the January-March period. Starbucks said it plans to open up its Rewards app to non-members in July so they can take advantage of the deals it offers.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s has heard its customer complaints about high food prices and it\u2019s bringing back a $5 value meal to appease those criticisms\u2014but don\u2019t look for the deal to last too long.\n\nStarting June 25, the company will offer four items, a McChicken or McDouble burger, a four piece chicken nuggets, fries and a drink\u2014for just five bucks. But that offer will only last for a month.\n\nThe deal delivers on a promise made by CEO Chris Kempczinski, who said the company would increase the number of cost-effective menu items after McDonald\u2019s\u00a0missed earning expectations for the first time in almost four years in 2023\u2019s fourth quarter\n\nKempczinski, at the time, conceded people making less than $45,000 per year\u2014who were at one time, the chain\u2019s core customer base\u2014were no longer dining at McDonald\u2019s. Overall fast-food traffic was down 3.5% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, as prices have largely risen across the board.\n\nTo avoid losing money on the value meal deal, McDonalds is working with The Coca-Cola Company, which will subsidize the specials, kicking in $4.6 million, The Wall Street Journal reports. Coca-Cola works with partners routinely for promotions.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has been under fire more than most, though, as customers have complained about $8 chicken sandwiches and $18 Big Mac meals, coining the phrase \u201cMcFlation\u201d.\n\nA short-term deal might get people back into the stores for the short term, but the big question is will those customers keep coming after menu prices return to normal? Other promotions and the return of fan-favorite menu items (like the McRib) can stem some of the red ink, but if customers still view the chain as unaffordable, it could continue to see losses.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Higher grocery bills are here to stay.\n\nOverall food prices were unchanged month over month in April, while food inflation increased 2.2% year over year, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nGroceries prices jumped 1.1% compared to last year, but dropped 0.2% compared to March.\n\n\"Grocery store prices are sort of flattening out,\" BLS economist Steve Reed told Yahoo Finance. \"This month, they were a mixed bag with some increases and some declines.\"\n\nPrice growth is returning to pre-pandemic times, where volatility primarily exist in specific categories that are affected by temporary supply issues, added Reed.\n\nWage growth can also cause prices to change, as it adds cost to producers. However, \"1 to 2% year-over-year growth in food prices is the normal,\" said Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Michael Swanson.\n\nHe expects food inflation to \"stay\" in this lower range, to reflect the wages of those producing the food.\n\n\"That's what the Feds watching, the Fed [is] saying, we need the wage growth and the price growth to come back into balance around our 2% target and foods is doing its piece \u2014 better than some of the other sectors,\" Swanson said. UNITED STATES - APRIL 6: A shopper takes a carton of eggs from the cooler in a grocery store in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, April 6, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nItems that saw the largest monthly jump include butter, up 4.3%, flour and prepared flour mixes, up 3.2%, and breakfast cereal, up 3.1%,\n\nFrozen non-carbonated juices and drinks saw the largest year-over-year jump across the entire CPI report, up 29.2%. It's the largest increase for the category ever, per Reed, presenting a challenge to the industry.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) CEO James Quincey told Yahoo Finance, \"US consumers are doing better in the sense that wages are rising relative to inflation and purchasing power is kind of stabilizing out ... The lower-income consumers are under a little more pressure, looking more clearly for value.\"\n\nCoca Cola's unit case volume increased 1% in Q1.\n\nEgg prices, which many feared would see a huge uptick due to a few cases of the bird flu, dropped 7.3% last month. A dozen, large Grade A eggs now cost $2.86. Swanson expects prices to remain lower as producers get past any spring outbreaks of the avian influenza.\n\nThis fresh read on CPI comes as a group of 40 lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, called on US President Joe Biden to investigate grocery store chains for price manipulation. In the letter, they urged the President to take action to lower food costs.\n\nThe cost for dining out drove overall food inflation higher in April. Food away from home jumped 4.1% compared to a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, that's the 14th straight month of \"sequential deceleration,\" per a note from JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman, as the pace of growth slows down.\n\nSwanson says prices have to drop soon.\n\n\"There's going to be more softening in that category, they just can't continue to run at four times higher than inflation rate, and food at home,\" he said.\n\nMonth-over-month, food away from home was up 0.3%. Many were expecting an even more significant increase, as higher commodity costs and labor inflation persists, particularly in California where the FAST ACT took effect, causing minimum wage to jump to $20 per hour on April 1.\n\nGlobal chains like Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's (MCD) have seen US consumers pull back on spending. In their latest quarterly results, both chains missed sales growth expectations from the Street.\n\n\"High rents, food and energy prices are squeezing low to medium income households, a downside risk to our upbeat outlook for consumer spending for the remainder of this year,\" Ryan Sweet, Oxford Chief US Economist said in a note to clients.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company stated that the momentum continued into April.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, CMG reported adjusted EPS of $13.37, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.63. The bottom line increased 27.3% from $10.50 reported in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues of $2.7 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $2.68 billion by 1%.

        "content": "While the string of robust jobs reports (the April print aside) offers an optimistic view of the economy, a more nuanced analysis arguably drives the case for consumer defensive stocks to buy. With multiple factors to consider, playing it (relatively) safe might not be a bad idea.\n\nFor one thing, the April jobs report showed that the economy added fewer employment opportunities than expected. This dynamic indicates a disinflationary trend, which may be what the Federal Reserve wants. However, it also suggests that fewer employers \u2013 especially those offering high-paying jobs \u2013 are in the labor market.\n\nSecond, consumers have been demonstrating caution for certain discretionary purchases. This pensiveness also extends to health and personal care expenditures. Amid a collective credit card debt load that soared beyond $1 trillion, that\u2019s understandable. However, it also suggests that cyclical ideas could suffer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn that case, consumer defensive stocks to buy may be the way to go. Below are several names to consider.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a big-box retailing giant, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) makes a practical case for consumer defensive stocks to buy. It\u2019s open to any customer, thus preventing the friction associated with membership-only retailer. Further, Walmart\u2019s convenient locations and massive footprint enables it to soak up demand that\u2019s not tied to e-commerce transactions. As well, online retailers might incur challenges if the economic situation worsens.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Walmart has consistently matched or exceeded bottom-line quarterly targets. In fiscal 2023, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.88%. I don\u2019t expect many surprises (good or bad) for its upcoming fiscal first-quarter disclosure, set for May 16. It should do what it\u2019s been doing, which is perfectly fine.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate earnings per share of $2.36 on revenue of $637.49 billion. That\u2019s a relatively solid improvement from last year\u2019s results of $2.22 EPS on sales of $648.12 billion. Combined with a forward annual dividend yield of 1.37%, WMT makes for a decent idea for consumer defensive stocks to buy.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nA department store operator primarily focused on the apparel retail segment, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) makes an arguably strong case for consumer defensive stocks to buy. Yes, it\u2019s true that consumers have been cutting back on apparel. However, with the job market for white-collar positions increasingly getting more competitive, it\u2019s imperative to make a good first impression. TJX can help facilitate this directive at a discount.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilar to Walmart, TJX isn\u2019t delivering what I would call remarkable results. Instead, it\u2019s putting one foot in front of the other and making forward progress. As a defensive idea, you really can\u2019t ask for much more. In fiscal 2023, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 7.58%. I don\u2019t expect many fireworks (again, good or bad) when it releases Q1 results on May 22.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate EPS to land at $4.10 on revenue of $56.28 billion. These stats represent a decent improvement over last year\u2019s results of earnings of $3.86 on sales of $54.22 billion. TJX pays a forward yield of 1.52%, which is something to keep in mind.\n\nColgate-Palmolive (CL) Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrush\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a powerhouse brand in the consumer goods sector, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) makes an obvious case for defensive ideas to consider. No matter what happens in the economy, people need to take care of themselves, whether we\u2019re talking about oral hygiene or other needs. Further, people need to address regular maintenance issues within their residences. Colgate-Palmolive provides the products that people use every day.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Colgate brand may benefit from generational awareness. Chances are, if your parents used particular consumer brands, you might follow suit out of habit. Unsurprisingly, the company has benefited from consistent financial performances. In the past four quarters ending Q1 2024, Colgate\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 4.7%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will land at $3.53 on revenue of $20.21 billion. Again, that\u2019s a solid improvement over last year\u2019s results of $3.23 EPS on sales of $19.46 billion. The company also carries a forward dividend yield of 2.1%. That makes CL a steady hand among consumer defensive stocks to buy.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) A photo of soda ash in crystal form.\n\nSource: Mitzxxz / Shutterstock.com\n\nA soft-drink manufacturer, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) represents one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Based on present economic conditions, KO could also be one of the top consumer defensive stocks to buy. With white-collar jobs becoming increasingly difficult to attain in this labor market, trips to pricey coffee shops add up. However, caffeine-addicted Americans need to find a cheap alternative.\n\nThat\u2019s where Coca-Cola comes into play. With a variety of pick-me-up beverages to choose from, customers can get their fix and spare their wallet. In the past four quarters ending Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise reached 4.38%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $2.82 on revenue of $45.68 billion. That\u2019s a relatively sizable improvement over last year\u2019s print of earnings of $2.50 on sales of $42.5 billion. Further, next year could see EPS of $3.02 with a top line of $47.89 billion.\n\nCoca-Cola also carries a forward yield of 3.07%. That alone helps make it one of the consumer defensive stocks to buy.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nThe crown jewel of the fast-food industry, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) may be an anachronistic name. Nevertheless, consistent demand and a willingness to innovate makes MCD one of the top-tier consumer defensive stocks to buy. Outside of a severe economic fallout, there appears to be robust demand for cheap eateries. Plus, its drive-thru only concept CosMc\u2019s could be a hit as social normalization trends accelerate.\n\nGenerally speaking, McDonald\u2019s consistently beats its bottom-line quarterly targets. In the past four quarters, its positive earnings surprise came out to 5.93%. That said, Q1 saw a slight miss, with EPS of $2.70 falling short of the expected print of $2.72. Still, moving forward, a tough economic environment could cynically benefit McDonald\u2019s as one of the low-cost leaders.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS to reach $12.20 on revenue of $26.62 billion. That\u2019s a sizable leap from last year\u2019s results of $11.15 EPS on sales of $23.82 billion. Combined with a forward dividend yield of 2.43%, MCD makes an attractive package for consumer defensive stocks to buy.\n\nFive Below (FIVE) storefront of a five below, FIVE Stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA discount dollar store, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) adds a distinct twist to the framework. Rather than focusing strictly on $1 products, Five Below features a mainline product portfolio that goes up to $5. Moreover, it offers a select range of merchandise that can rise to $25. Therefore, this pricing flexibility attracts a wider customer base. It\u2019s tailored for modest-income shoppers as well as everyday bargain hunters.\n\nTo be fair, FIVE stock has been a heavily volatile idea. Therefore, only the most risk tolerant speculators should consider it. At the same time, the red ink may present a relatively discounted opportunity. Outside of its fiscal Q4 2023 earnings print (which was a miss), the overall performance last year was solid. The positive earnings surprise inclusive of the miss came out to 3.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts are projecting EPS of $6.04 on revenue of $4.04 billion. It\u2019s possible that the EPS target could be optimistic. However, the top-line forecast could be reasonable given the broader demand profile.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nA tobacco giant focused on global markets, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is undoubtedly controversial. For one thing, anti-tobacco advocacy groups have done an excellent job detailing the health risks of smoking. Also, younger investors are more attuned to environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns. Buying up shares of a tobacco company might appear contradictory to this narrative.\n\nHowever, we also know that meme-stock traders aggressively bid up shares of private prisons. As an investment category, one could make the case that private prions represent the most contentious idea. So, I really believe that the ESG risk to Philip Morris is less than what many experts fear. And aside from a miss in Q4, the tobacco giant has consistently beaten its bottom-line quarterly targets.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are projecting EPS of $6.29 on revenue of $36.94 billion. These figures represent a solid improvement over the prior year\u2019s print of $6.01 EPS on sales of $35.25 billion. What\u2019s more, the popularity of alternative smoking products (i.e. vaping) should make PM stock a buy.\n\nOh yeah, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 5.22%. It\u2019s one of the consumer defensive stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chicken is the new beef \u2014 and becoming the crown jewel of fast-food menus",
        "content": "Where\u2019s the beef chicken?\n\nFood chains are pushing chicken, as the cheaper protein is easier for consumers' tightening wallets, aligns with healthy eating trends, and allows companies more room for innovation.\n\nFrom Chipotle (CMG) to Burger King (QSR), chicken was the star of the show in the latest earnings reports. Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo said restaurants are realizing they can \"combine a lower price point than might attract a decent consumer base with a decent level of flavor profiles.\"\n\nFor Chipotle, limited-time offers like Chicken al Pastor boosted results against a difficult macro consumer backdrop, with store foot traffic up 5.4%. Despite higher prices, its regular chicken burrito costs roughly $9 to $10 depending on location, which many still perceive as a value option.\n\nBurger King introduced a fiery buffalo royal crispy chicken wrap at $2.99 in the quarter, which contributed to its US same-store sales growth of 3.9%. Burger King is bringing the heat to its fan-favorite wraps with an all-new Fiery Buffalo Royal Crispy Wrap (Courtesy: Burger King)\n\nMeanwhile, Shake Shack (SHAK) offered a free chicken sandwich with a $10 purchase every Sunday in April, capitalizing on Chick-fil-A being closed on that day of the week.\n\nThe CEO of Dine Brands, which owns IHOP and Applebee's, even hinted at a limited-time value promotion around chicken next quarter to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat increasing competition is hitting traditional chicken-only chains.\n\n\"At KFC US, same-store sales were pressured from unfavorable weather events and chicken value promotions from QSR competitors,\" David Gibbs, CEO of KFC's parent company Yum! Brands (YUM), recently said on an earnings call.\n\nMore companies will likely look to innovate in this space as diners struggle with stubborn food inflation.\n\n\"Price competition was really a challenge,\" CFRA analyst Siye Desta told Yahoo Finance. \"A lot of people have less of a budget, ... [and they think] the trade-off isn't worth it to pay that much more for beef.\"\n\nSince the pandemic, beef prices have been more inflationary and volatile than chicken. According to the latest Consumer Price Index data, whole chicken cost roughly $1.99 per pound, while ground beef fetched $5.13 per pound.\n\nTaco Bell (QSR) saw US sales increase by 2% as the brand launched a Chicken Cantina menu with slow-roasted chicken. Popeyes' US same-store sales jumped 6.2% last quarter as it pushed out a new wing offering.\n\nChicken wing chain Wingstop (WING) said innovation around flavor leads to repeat visits. \"Indulgent Wingstop occasions [is] something that consumers are starting to really appreciate, as they see others taking price,\" its CEO Michael Skipworth told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its latest quarter, Wingstop saw US same-store sales leap 21.6%.\n\nGargiulo said limited-time offerings like Wingstop's hot honey sandwich also incentivize consumers to order the product.\n\n\"I can always have the burger, but ... when [a flavor is] only today and you're driven by curiosity and ... you feel that chicken can be healthier [and] cheaper, ... you're swapping beef with chicken,\" Gargiulo explained.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning of a larger shift, as chicken is \"associated more with health and wellness,\" Gargiulo added.\n\nClassic burger maker McDonald's (MCD) is facing some pressure on the burger side, Gargiulo pointed out, which they're countering by offering more chicken items.\n\n\"We are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a call with investors following its Q3 2023 results. At its investor day last December, it shared plans to bring its chicken sandwich, the McCrispy, to all markets by the end of 2025, while expanding into wraps and tenders.\n\nChicken now makes up $25 billion dollars in systemwide sales for the Golden Arches, equal to the beef segment, JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe said in a December note to clients. McDonald's chicken nuggets reel in $10 billion in systemwide sales and are growing at a rate of more than 10% annually since fiscal 2019.\n\nIvankoe added that the global chicken market is twice the size of beef \u2014 a factor to consider for fast food conglomerates looking to expand overseas.\n\nTyson Foods (TSN), which supplies a majority of quick-service restaurants in the US, said chicken will likely be used as a tactic to lure in customers. The company sells 19 billion-20 billion nuggets per year.\n\n\"Traffic at QSR has been under a little pressure,\" Tyson CEO Donnie King told Yahoo Finance. \"They're going to quickly respond to do something about that traffic, and getting chicken on a menu there or [promoting] chicken is, in my mind, a very likely scenario.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Diamonds in the Rough: 3 Dow Stocks That Won\u2019t Stay This Cheap for Long",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been on quite the applaud-worthy winning streak of late, with the timeless market index up for seven consecutive days between May 1 and Friday\u2019s session. (The index did close slightly lower on Monday but was still up from Thursday.) The impressive Dow rally seems to show market breadth has been improving over the past week.\n\nThough the technology sector remains robust, one can\u2019t help but notice that some of the more speculative hyper-growth plays (especially the ones that aren\u2019t yet profitable) have run into a brick wall after reporting their recent quarters.\n\nWhether that\u2019s a precursor to a rotation back to old-fashioned \u201cvalue\u201d plays, like many included within the Dow 30, remains to be seen. Regardless, investors seeking to lighten up on growth may wish to start with some blue chips within the Dow. Some of the relative laggards of the group may be diamonds in the rough worth stashing away for the long haul.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) An image of a McDonald's Corporation (MCD) filet-o-fish meal\n\nSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and most of the fast-food industry have been hit with serious volatility as lower-income consumers put off by prices opt to eat elsewhere (likely from home). The company\u2019s top boss, Chris Kempczinski, said he and his team are \u201claser-focused\u201d on improving upon the value proposition it may have been known for in the past (at least before inflation hit), and investors would have been wise to take his word for it.\n\nOn Friday, the stock popped 2.6% after Bloomberg revealed that McDonald\u2019s has an impressive $5.00 value menu in the works. Such a menu may include the McChicken or McDouble. That\u2019s the kind of value proposition that will be very hard to beat. And such a deal may be the perfect weapon to take massive market share from rivals. Despite the pop, MCD stock is still down 8% year to date.\n\nThe only thing richer with value than McDonald\u2019s new $5.00 meal deal may be the stock, which goes for just 23.3 times trailing price-to-earnings. The 2.5% dividend yield also looks quite tasty.\n\nIntel (INTC) blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Rose Carson / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust when you thought the tides were turning back in favor of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) amid the AI boom, INTC stock proceeded to shed most of the gains enjoyed through 2023. Undoubtedly, it\u2019s painful for Intel shareholders who didn\u2019t take profits when they could after a remarkable relief rally of a year. Year to date, INTC stock is down 38%, making it the biggest 2024 loser (so far) for the Dow.\n\nAfter news broke that Intel\u2019s license to sell chips to Chinese smartphone maker Huawei had been revoked, it seemed like nothing could go right for the chipmaker as its turnaround efforts hit a pothole. At slightly more than $30 per share, I do think the Dow dog is worth stashing on the radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough I won\u2019t be a buyer quite yet, I do find expectations have come down substantially following its latest rough quarter, which included lower revenue guidance. Low expectations are always a good thing if you\u2019re looking to buy on massive dips.\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares are down just shy of 4% year to date, but don\u2019t count the networking equipment giant out quite yet. Looking ahead, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins sounds like he\u2019s ready to harness the power of AI.\n\nUndoubtedly, there isn\u2019t much to get excited about when looking under the hood of Cisco as it stands today. That said, Robbins seems to have his sights set on long-term growth, noting his firm is betting on what could be a \u201cdecade-long run with AI.\u201d The plan is encouraging, but there\u2019s quite a bit of room to cover if Cisco\u2019s going to catch up with its tech rivals.\n\nWith a modest 14.6 times trailing P/E multiple, though, you\u2019re getting a pretty compelling entry point. But do make sure you\u2019re prepared to play the long game alongside Cisco, and are ready to ride out the bumps on the road as the nearer-term outlook remains less than impressive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of McDonald\u2019s.

        "content": "Signs are starting to emerge that a relatively high number of Americans are having trouble paying their bills. In the fourth quarter of last year, credit card debt surged by $143 billion year-over-year. And the number of credit cards and auto loans moving into delinquency is higher now than before the pandemic. And in another sign that working-class Americans are looking for value, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) said last month that it would be \u201claser focused on affordability.\u201d Here are three discount retail stocks to buy as tens of millions of Americans look to spend less.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast December, investment bank TD CowenidentifiedWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock as a buy. It cited the company\u2019s prowess in technology and its successful launch of its e-commerce service, Walmart+. The bank noted that the retail giant\u2019s digital ad revenue consistently grows by 10% or more annually. Meanwhile, its grocery and health and wellness businesses have been expanding.\n\nIn January, the retail giant reported that it had launched a new AI-powered search that allows customers to search for products that fit certain events such as a football watch party. Walmart is also using AI to better understand customers\u2019 needs and to provide them with the products that they require.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVery impressively, the firm\u2019s operating income soared 30% in the fourth quarter YOY to $7.3 billion. The shares have a very low enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 13.4 times, along with a significant dividend yield of 1.4%.\n\nGiven Walmart\u2019s multiple, positive catalysts and low valuation, it is one of the best discount retail stocks to buy.\n\nThe TJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J.

Meanwhile, TJX can continue to successfully open multiple different types of stores going forward. UBS set a $132 price target on the name and believes that its price-earnings multiple could eventually jump as high as 30 times from its current 24.3 times.\n\nOn May 2, Barron\u2019s identified TJX as one of the discount retailers that has consistently gained market share \u201cfor years.\u201d Meanwhile, with Macy\u2019s (NYSE:M) poised to close 150 of its stores, TJX may be the best positioned company to capitalize on this development.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwo top Wall Street banks recently released very bullish notes on Target (NYSE:TGT) stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitiupgraded the shares to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral.\u201d The bank believes that the retailer is benefiting from its low prices and can increase its EBIT margin. The bank placed a $180 price target on the name, and reports that the company is a winner within the retail landscape.\n\nBank of America reported that consumers\u2019 perceptions of the retail behemoth are improving. With Target\u2019s comparable sales starting to rise, the bank expects its gross margin to increase.\n\nIn a further indication that the Street is becoming more bullish on the name, the shares have surged over 12% so far this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Jack in the Box JACK is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 14, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95.\n\nHow are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.43 per share, indicating a decline of 2.7% from $1.47 reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $369.7 million. The metric suggests a 6.6% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nJack in the Box\u2019s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from menu innovation, focus on delivery channels and marketing strategies. This and strategic investments in store improvements and new store build are likely to have aided restaurant-level economics in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company is focused on addressing opportunities within the breakfast segment, including reintroducing previously removed items. Efforts to enhance breakfast market share involve integrating breakfast into regular marketing activities, introducing innovative breakfast offerings, and experimenting with new promotions, primarily through digital platforms, to attract and re-engage customers. The initiatives are anticipated to have positively influenced the company's performance in the fiscal second quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, soft restaurant contributions due to a decline in transactions and menu mix are likely to have negatively influenced the top line in the fiscal second quarter. Our model predicts restaurant sales and franchise royalties & other revenues to depreciate 13% and 2.4% year over year to $176.2 million and $52.7 million, respectively.\r\n\r\nWage inflation and increases in food and packaging costs and utilities are discouraging. The headwinds are likely to have affected the company\u2019s fiscal second-quarter bottom line on a year-over-year basis.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Jack in the Box this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Jack in the Box has an Earnings ESP of +0.38%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company has a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRecent Retail-Wholesale Releases\n\nYum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC reported impressive first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. The upside can be attributed to robust total system sales growth and new unit contribution.\n\nDuring the quarter, YUMC reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 71 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents. The bottom line moved up 2.9% from 69 cents reported a year ago. Quarterly revenues of $2.96 billion outpaced the consensus mark of $2.94 billion. The top line inched up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding foreign currency translation, revenues increased 7% year over year.\r\n\r\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG released stellar first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the company reported benefits from enhanced throughput and effective marketing initiatives like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, leading to strong sales and transaction growth. CMG stated that the momentum continued into April.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, CMG reported adjusted EPS of $13.37, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.63. The bottom line increased 27.3% from $10.50 reported in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues of $2.7 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $2.68 billion by 1%. The top line rose 14.1% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong comparable restaurant sales growth and new restaurant openings.\r\n\r\nMcDonald's Corporation MCD posted mixed first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, MCD reported McDonald's reported adjusted EPS of $2.70, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71. EPS increased 2% year over year. Quarterly net revenues of $6,169 million beat the consensus mark of $6,168 million.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on a hot streak, rising each of the first nine days of May. According to Barron\u2019s, only three of the index\u2019s 30 components \u2014 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) \u2014 dropped in that time. Meanwhile, Amgen (NYSE:AMGN), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have all been on hot streaks in May. Conversely, 80% of the S&P 500 rose during the same time frame. Some of its key components, including CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), have tumbled more than 10% in May. It appears that investors are starting to grow less thrilled with technology and AI for the time being. That trend is beneficial for the Dow, which is much less tech-oriented than the S&P 500. Specifically, 30% of the S&P 500\u2019s components are in the tech sector versus only 19% of Dow stocks. For investors wanting to exploit the Dow\u2019s new-found strength, here are the three best Dow stocks to buy in May.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is clearly continuing to benefit significantly from the strength of the upper-middle class and wealthy consumers. Adobe Analytics recently reported that online retail spending in America jumped 7% in the first four months of the year.\n\nSo it\u2019s unsurprising that in the first quarter, American Express\u2019 EPS soared 27% YOY to $3.33. Meanwhile, its top line advanced 12% YOY to $15.8 billion. Given the large increase of the company\u2019s bottom line, its forward price-earnings ratio of 18.6 times is quite attractive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll of these factors make American Express one of the best Dow stocks to buy in May.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is getting a big lift from the improvements of the stock, credit and IPO markets, along with increased M&A activity. The firm will likely get a boost from the Fed\u2019s determination to cut interest rates, as this will benefit nearly all of its operating markets.\n\nAs of last month, GS stock has been identified as one of the top American equities by Bank of America. Additionally, Argus raised its rating on the shares to \u201cBuy,\u201d citing the rejuvenation of the firm\u2019s investment banking business. Argus expects Goldman\u2019s investment banking unit to continue to deliver strong returns going forward. The huge investment bank\u2019s underwriting business expanded last quarter, while M&A activity jumped nearly 20% last quarter industrywide YOY.\n\nIndicating that the Street is warming up to GS stock, the shares have climbed almost 17% in the last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmgen CEO Robert Bradway\u00a0recently reported that he was encouraged by the interim results of a Phase 2 trial of the company\u2019s weight-loss drug, MariTide. Bradway noted that he was confident that the treatment would help patients. The firm did not release any Phase 2 data on the drug, but it\u2019s expected to do so later this year. Some evidence indicates that MariTide helps patients keep weight off even after discontinuing the drug. That would be an important, key differentiator for MariTide compared to competing treatments. Additionally, MariTide is administered monthly, while the leading, currently available weight-loss drugs have to be taken weekly.\n\nInvestment bank William Blair upgraded Amgen to \u201cOutperform\u201d in the wake of the news. The bank thinks the drug can be a multi-blockbuster and believes that it can reduce patients\u2019 weight by 20% or more.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held GS bonds and long positions in INTC and AMZN.

        "title": "The Must-Watch List: 3 Stocks to Snap Up as Soon as They Hit Bargain Territory",
        "content": "High interest rates are here to stay. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the fight against inflation had stalled and the central bank was leaving interest rates unchanged. It wasn\u2019t unexpected but it means that costs will remain elevated for an extended period for business. The Fed will try to slow the economy through its higher-for-longer policies. Although businesses can learn to adjust to the new normal, it takes a toll on their performance and causes stock prices to fall. Investors should be ready.\n\nIt\u2019s not an indication that the businesses are broken, only that the government is inept at managing the economy. Eventually this period will pass and businesses will pick up again, allowing their stocks to rise. By buying shares while they\u2019re down, investors will juice their portfolio returns on the recovery.\n\nBelow are three bargain stocks to buy for just such a scenario.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee shop Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is the perfect example of this in action. It just reported quarterly results that stunned Wall Street with how bad they were. While the chain had been passing along its increased costs to consumers, coffee drinkers pushed back in the fiscal second quarter and decided to pass on the high-priced brew. Sales fell 2% in the period to $8.6 billion. Adjusted profits plunged 14% year over year to 68 cents per share.\n\nStarbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said economic conditions were to blame.\n\n\u201cWe continue to feel the impact of a more cautious consumer,\u201d he told analysts, \u201cparticularly with our more occasional customer, and a deteriorating economic outlook has weighed on customer traffic and impact felt broadly across the industry.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the fault of Starbucks, and as Narasimhan suggested, it\u2019s hurting everyone. McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) also felt the effects of government and Fed policies with an earnings miss.\n\nThat, however, does make Starbucks a bargain stock to buy. Maybe don\u2019t rush right in, but the stock cratered 16% after earnings and is beginning to look much more attractive than it has for some time. As the coffee shop isn\u2019t sure whether it will cut prices to lure customers back, the malaise could linger for the stock. But this is now a discounted company you might want to buy.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nObesity and diabetes often go hand in hand, which is why combating one can help minimize the other. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is making bank with therapies for both, following rival Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) blowing up the market with its celebrity-endorsed treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead of using semaglutide as its glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, Lilly uses terzepatide as the wunderkind in Mounjaro and Zepbound. The treatments were only approved by the Food & Drug Administration last November but are already generating massive results. Worldwide sales of Mounjaro rocketed to $1.8 billion in the first quarter following U.S. approval, versus $565 million last year. Zepbound saw $517 million in sales in its first full quarter after approval.\n\nBut Eli Lilly isn\u2019t a one-trick pony (or two tricks in this instance). It has a portfolio of solid therapies. One of the best performers was Verzenio, a treatment for advanced metastatic breast cancer. Sales surged 40% to $1 billion, driven by increased U.S. demand. But that led to large back orders and Lilly is forecasting tight supplies going forward. How much money it makes will be restricted by how much it can produce.\n\nLimited capacity to meet demand could eventually bite Lilly, which might not be so bad for investors considering the hefty premium Eli Lilly stock carries. Shares go for 116 times trailing earnings, 60 times estimates and 20 times sales. That\u2019s not cheap. Any meaningful pullback in the stock, however, should be an invitation to buy.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwo months ago, I wrote that Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) was primed for a price cut via a stock split. Trading at $554 per share, I said that the beauty and personal care retailer would benefit from the increased liquidity and availability of its stock by splitting them to make them more affordable. Well, investors got a price cut \u2014 but not from any split.\n\nUlta Beauty stock was crushed last month after warning it was seeing a slowdown in sales across the first two months of the quarter. Shares are down 30% from the highs hit shortly after my article published. They recently closed just under $400 a share.\n\nThat makes them much more attractive even if they still trade at triple-digit prices. Ulta is the largest specialty beauty retailer in the U.S., with nearly 1,375 stores in all 50 states. After the haircut, shares trade at just 15 times trailing earnings, 13 times estimates and less than 2 times sales. Ulta also goes for 18 times the free cash flow (FCF) it produces. Closer to 10 times FCF would indicate that Ulta Beauty stock is a bargain-basement steal. But even at these levels, it makes for an attractive stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Jim Cramer Talks About 10 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list,\u00a0click Jim Cramer Talks About 5 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices.\n\nLast week, Jim Cramer reviewed latest earnings from some of the top retailers and consumer companies in the US and analyzed how Americans are reacting to the ever-increasing pricing pressures. Cramer said that looking at the earnings reported by some retailers so far, it's clear that if you are going to keep prices elevated, you will \"lose customers.\" Cramer said that there are very few retailers who are willing to accept that prices are just \"too darn high.\"\n\nRetail: \"The Ugly Ducking\"\n\nJim Cramer thinks retail is the \"ugly duckling\" when compared to travel and leisure because \"people don\u2019t want to spend money on physical items unless they have to.\" However, the inflation crisis has forced people to be more \"frugal\" according to Cramer, even if it means getting a \"lower quality hamburger or a latte.\"\n\n\"If you acknowledge it without doing anything about it, you are setting yourself up for disappointing numbers going forward,\" Cramer warned retailers.\n\nIn a separate program last week, Cramer said that in the current environment, where many tech stocks are \"treading water,\" investors wonder whether they should sell their current positions and invest in \"passive\" sectors like healthcare, industrials or banks.\n\nCramer Recalls His \"Brutal\" Hedge Fund Days\n\nCramer said back when he was running his hedge fund, he had to review his portfolio \"three times a day\" and defend his stock picks to his then wife Karen Cramer, who was also a half owner of the now-closed Cramer & Co, Cramer's hedge fund.\n\nCramer said that he had to incorporate rate cuts, analyst reports, negative news or valuation concerns while adjusting his portfolio on a daily basis.\n\nIt, according to the CNBC host, was \"brutal\" but \"necessary\" because Cramer and his wife were managing other people's money and they were \"looking over their shoulders.\"\n\nCramer recalled that his ex-wife always insisted on selling \"dead money\" stocks, advocating investing in other stocks that could \"win.\"\n\nCramer Does Not Want You to Sell Your Stocks Based on Market Chatter\n\nWhile all of these practices \"served\" him \"well,\" Cramer said that's not how he manages money at his Charitable Trust. Cramer said without constant criticism on your every move, you can afford to invest in companies that you believe in and \"stick with them as long as the facts don\u2019t fall apart on you.\" However, Cramer noted that sticking to stocks when they are going down is difficult in the short term, but emphasized that stocks suffer selloffs for \"all kinds of reasons.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer said that as long as the basic thesis holds, you should always resist selling your positions no matter what the \"billionaire class\" or \"hedge fund managers\" say. Jim Cramer Talks About 10 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices\n\nLast week Cramer talked in detail about some consumer stocks, including retail and restaurant companies, and analyzed how inflation is affecting these companies. We picked 10 of these companies and mentioned Cramer's comments about them. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Some top names in the list include McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). Why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nJim Cramer mentioned Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT), the parent company of Chilli's restaurant, as an example of consumer companies managing to grow business despite inflation pressures. According to Cramer Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT) executed a \"barbell\" strategy offering lower price items for more value conscious consumers and premium items for affluent customers.\n\n\"That was a good idea, this stock keeps going higher,\" Cramer added.\n\n9. Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nJim Cramer highlighted that Tyson Foods Inc's (NYSE:TSN) Prepared Foods business has seen about 20% accumulative inflation over the past three years, and it has now become \"too pricey\" for many Americans. In another program earlier this year, Cramer called Tyson a \"horrendous\" stock but still recommended investors to buy.\n\nHe said at the time that the stock was \u201cabout to go up.\u201d Cramer said while input costs in the chicken industry are doing down, we are \u201cabout to have a chicken price explosion.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why doesn\u2019t he like Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) when its margins are going up, Cramer reiterated that he\u2019s actually recommending people to buy the stock; he just wants Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\u00a0\u00a0to lower chicken prices.\n\nIn addition to TSN, Cramer is also talking about McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG).\n\n8. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 30\n\nJim Cramer said kitchenware and home furnishings company Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) reported some \"excellent\" numbers. Cramer said while Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) is not a cheap retailer as it's regarded as a \"high-quality brand\" and \"that's what people want.\"\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn a strong showing for the Strategy\u2019s consumer discretionary holdings,\u00a0Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM), which sells kitchenware and home furnishings, was the top contributor in the quarter after its August earnings report showed exceptional profitability and the company raised its full-year guidance. Shares jumped further in September after a private equity firm increased its stake, suggesting recent weakness was overdone. The company\u2019s high-quality fundamentals make it a good defensive fit for an uncertain environment: it generates significant free cash flows, has no debt and the liquidity to invest in the business first and then return excess to shareholders.\u201d\n\n7. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nWhen it comes to Yum! Brands, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:YUM), Cramer said the stock got hit despite the fact that Yum! Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM)\u00a0Taco Bell brand offered very cheap options. Some other segments of Yum! Brands, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:YUM)\u00a0were not able to offset inflation-related headwinds with low-price offers though, according to Cramer. In November 2023, Cramer highlighted that the market was focusing too much on Pizza Hut and ignoring KFC and Taco-Bell, which he believed are Yum! Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM)\u00a0strengths.\n\nLike YUM, Cramer is also talking about McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG).\n\nThe company in its Q1 earnings call talked about guidance and the state of business:\n\n\"With the KFC UK deal behind us, our cash balance will return to a normalized rate of around $400 million, excluding the unrepatriated Devyani proceeds. Thereafter, with no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we plan to use our excess free cash flow primarily to fund share repurchases, absent accretive investments we choose to make. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Subsequent to the quarter end, we renewed our pro rata credit facility, including our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. We were pleased to renew the $2 billion facility with the same pricing and terms that we achieved in 2021 while also increasing the revolver from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion.\n\nNow let me discuss our latest outlook on full year 2024. We are confident that 2024 will showcase a strong unit development story at or above 5% unit growth, led by KFC International as franchisees capitalize on our brand\u2019s attractive paybacks. In the U.S., Taco Bell continues to balance core everyday value to cater to a more discerning consumer across income groups with premium innovation to attract new consumers. We expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex special G&A to be flat to down slightly for the year, including incremental G&A associated with the KFC UK acquisition. Finally, we are confident we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 36\n\nJim Cramer said he finds Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M) as the \"most intriguing\" stock among the retail stock universe. Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M) has added two new board members to avoid a proxy fight with Arkhouse Management. Cramer wondered whether this appointment would thwart the $24 bid to takeover Macy's. Cramer said he's \"guessing\" that Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M) would be given time to \"work it magic.\"\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Talks About 5 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Says \u201cHang On To Stocks\u201d and Recommends 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024 Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "title": "McDonald's Insiders Sell US$7.5m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "content": "The fact that multiple McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe President, Christopher Kempczinski, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$280 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$275. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nInsiders in McDonald's didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nMcDonald's Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders sold US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. McDonald's insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$418m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The McDonald's Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, McDonald's makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for McDonald's you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "The 7 Most Undervalued Under-$50 Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "As earnings season winds down, the long-awaited shift from growth to value seems to be emerging. Many tech stocks are down despite good earnings as investors hunt for bargains. That\u2019s a good reason to explore undervalued stocks under $50.\n\nTo begin with, investors like stocks under $50 because they can make a small investment go further. But, there\u2019s a difference between price and value. Some stocks under $50 don\u2019t have much upside left for investors. And if they don\u2019t pay a dividend, you can find better options.\n\nBut that leads to another reason to look for undervalued stocks under $50. A little price movement can mean a greater return. For example, if the stock price of\u00a0McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) goes up $2, that\u2019s less than 1% of the share price. But that same movement in a stock trading for $30 is a 7% gain.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, without further adieu, let\u2019s look at some undervalued stocks that give investors good reason to believe they\u2019ll outperform as investors hunt for value.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a polarizing stock. It also happens to be crushing it, according to its CEO, Alex Karp. Objectively, Karp\u2019s not wrong. By virtually any measure, Palantir delivered a sterling first-quarter earnings report. The one hiccup was that full-year revenue guidance came in lighter than expected.\n\nIs that a reason for the 16% drop in the PLTR stock price after the earnings report? Not by itself, but the stock is objectively overvalued. And the company was coming off several quarters of year-over-year (YoY) growth that was going to be tough to repeat.\n\nPalantir is a battle between short-term traders and long-term true believers. The traders have won the week after earnings, but the long-term narrative, which centers around AI, is still being written.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his Overweight rating on PLTR stock with a price target of $35. Ives has called Palantir the \u201cMessi of AI,\u201d which would seem to refute other claims that the company is an AI impostor. For what it\u2019s worth, Cathie Wood bought PLTR stock heavily after the post-earnings sell-off.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of this writing, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is trading at $44.03. That\u2019s after DKNG stock soared 77% in the last 12 months. And with the stock up 27% in 2024, DraftKings may not be one of the undervalued stocks under $50 much longer. That\u2019s particularly true if the company manages to become profitable (in terms of adjustable EBITDA) sometime in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, DraftKings generated $3.67 billion in revenue. That was about 18% of the $20 billion addressable market. DraftKings expects that number to jump to $30 billion by 2028, with an important caveat. That\u2019s for the states in which online sports betting already exists.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s certainly more likely than not that online sports betting will be legalized in several other states, including Texas and California, two of the holdouts prized by sports betting investors. If that\u2019s the case, the addressable market will be significantly larger.\n\nYes, this is a competitive market. But it\u2019s also a market in which 47% of users acknowledge using more than one sports betting app. That statement can cut both ways. But DraftKings has a significant first-mover advantage and, therefore, is top of mind for many sports betters.\n\nKinder Morgan (KMI) kinder morgan (KMI) sign on grass\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com\n\nKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is a midstream energy company that owns one of the largest networks of pipelines that move oil and natural gas around the United States and Canada. The company\u2019s stock is up 7.4% in 2024 and has held the gains despite a first-quarter earnings report in which it missed the top line and delivered in-line earnings.\n\nThat could be because analysts are looking at where demand may be coming from. According to Kinder Morgan, that demand will come from data centers, which run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and will need as much natural gas as the company can provide \u2014 especially as more AI applications come online.\n\nFor now, analysts maintain a consensus rating of Hold on KMI stock with a price target that\u2019s only 6% above the current price. But that may not reflect the increasing demand. Plus, Kinder Morgan pays a dividend with a current yield of 6.03%. That percentage can keep you ahead of inflation just by owning the stock.\n\nBank of America (BAC) bank of America stock BAC stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWarren Buffett has been in the news recently for what he\u2019s been buying and selling. However, you can put Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on the list of stocks that Buffett continues to hold tightly.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be too quickly overlooked, considering BAC is one of only a few bank stocks that Buffett holds. As of this writing, Berkshire-Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) owns 13.2% of the bank worth $39 billion.\n\nIf you were looking for bank stocks last March, BAC stock would have been one to buy. The \u201cbig banks\u201d offered financial stability when the banking sector was feeling the stress of high interest rates. To be fair, BofA was feeling stress from a higher cost of capital, a declining net interest margin and more net charge-offs.\n\nInterest rates will likely remain at their current level through summer. But 32.5% of investors believe a rate cut may be coming in July. That percentage goes up to 49.1% in September. With earnings expected to grow at 7.7% and trading at around 11x forward earnings, Bank of America is one to own when rates come down.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf one Warren Buffett stock is good, two may be better. For some skeptics, that\u2019s the best case to make for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC). The company has struggles that go beyond inflation and supply chain concerns. Consumer tastes are changing, and Kraft Heinz products don\u2019t offer the health benefits or sustainability that many consumers are looking for in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThose concerns are easily seen in the company\u2019s revenue and earnings, which can be described as one quarter forward and then two quarters back. It can also be seen in the KHC stock price, down 12.1% in the last 12 months and only up 10.6% in the last five years. A growth stock, KHC is not.\n\nBut this article is about value stocks. And that\u2019s where KHC stock shines. It trades around 11x earnings and pays a high-yield dividend, with a 4.48% yield.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon store sign. VZ stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf Kraft Heinz doesn\u2019t scratch your high-yield dividend stock itch, perhaps Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) will. The wireless business model isn\u2019t exciting, but it pays to be the market share leader, which is what Verizon is.\n\nStill, in 2023, the company\u2019s overall income from its wireless services climbed 3.3%. And the company believes the addition of AI technology will not only help streamline internal operations but delight consumers as well.\n\nOver the last five years, VZ stock dropped 30%, but investors have been treated a little better in the last 12 months, with the stock up about 5%. However, in each of those five years, shareholders have received a dividend. In fact, Verizon has increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years and currently has a yield of 6.69%.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for growth, there are better options. But if you\u2019re looking for income and value, Verizon is about as solid as they come and an easy choice when considering undervalued stocks under $50.\n\nDigitalBridge (DBRG) Real estate investment trust (REIT) on a black notebook on an office desk.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDigitalBridge (NYSE:DBRG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in digital infrastructure assets. That means data centers, cell towers and edge infrastructure. The increased demand for AI sent DigitalBridge\u2019s stock soaring while other REITs struggled in 2023.\n\nAs Louis Navellier wrote on InvestorPlace, \u201cTo operate generative AI applications, it will be important to access and connect cloud environments to manage the complex computations that generative AI demands.\u201d\n\nGranted, the case for DBRG stock as one of the undervalued stocks under $50 was more appealing at the beginning of the year when rate cuts appeared to be around the corner, no matter how unlikely. The stock has dropped 21.4% in the last month as investors became resigned to higher-for-longer rates.\n\nBut even if there are no interest rate cuts in 2024, demand for digital infrastructure will remain consistent. So, when you see the forecasts for 60% earnings growth in the next 12 months, it\u2019s easy to believe.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a long position in PLTR.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- McDonald\u2019s Corp. is looking to launch a $5 meal deal in the US that the burger chain is betting can lure penny-pinching consumers back in.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Set to Hit China EVs, Strategic Sectors With Tariffs Elon Musk Pledges to Grow Supercharger Business He Just Decimated Ackman Scolded Over DEI Views at Closed-Door Milken Session Apple Apologizes for iPad Pro Ad, Scraps Plan to Air It on TV Novavax Soars on $1.2 Billion Sanofi Vaccine Licensing Deal\n\nThe deal could include a McChicken or a McDouble along with fries and a drink, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. On the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said McDonald\u2019s had to be \u201claser-focused on affordability\u201d given how price-weary diners have become. The company\u2019s results were weaker than expected.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t have in the US right now is a national value platform,\u201d Kempczinski said, prompting questions from analysts about what such an offer might entail.\n\nAt McDonald\u2019s, franchisees pay into an advertising fund and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns, including promotions such as the viral Grimace Shake. A prior attempt to get operators \u2014 who run about 95% of US stores \u2014 to endorse the $5 meal initiative failed earlier this year, the person said.\n\nSome operators were concerned about losing money on the roughly four-week promotion, particularly in states such as California, where the minimum wage for fast-food workers jumped 25% to $20 an hour earlier this year. McDonald\u2019s has said that franchisee cash flows are up about 50% since 2018 and are still on the rise, though an independent group representing operators has raised concerns about the cost of labor and investments to freshen up stores.\n\nTo sweeten the deal, McDonald\u2019s enlisted money from Coca-Cola Co. that could help cushion a potential profitability hit for franchisees, the person familiar said. The size of the beverage company\u2019s contribution hasn\u2019t been decided, and the burger chain wasn\u2019t expected to put up funds. Coca-Cola, which often contributes to customers\u2019 marketing programs, declined to comment.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s declined to elaborate beyond Kempczinski\u2019s prior comments. John Palmaccio, the chairman of the operators\u2019 advertising fund, said in a statement to Bloomberg News that the company, franchisees and suppliers are coming together to deliver \u201cgreat value and affordability\u201d now that \u201cour customers really need it.\u201d\n\nCatching Up\n\nAfter years of solid sales and traffic results, McDonald\u2019s is now grappling with a pullback from low-income consumers, who account for a substantial portion of its clientele.\n\nStory continues\n\nKempczinski bemoaned in the most recent earnings call that the company was offering local deals and bundles rather than national promotions, as some competitors do. Restaurant Brands International Inc.\u2019s Burger King, for example, has a limited-time $5 duo, and Wendy\u2019s Co. a two-for-$3 breakfast deal.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s has had such strong sales in recent years that they didn\u2019t really need it,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research, which focuses on restaurants. \u201cNow that the consumer has shown by action that they\u2019re demanding value more than they were even six months ago, McDonald\u2019s is changing with the times.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the independent franchisee group urged the company to bring back the discontinued snack wraps, arguing they\u2019re \u201ccraveable, relatively simple to produce\u201d and could \u201ceasily satisfy the call for more affordable options on the menu.\u201d The organization cautioned against discounting the chain\u2019s \u201ciconic\u201d menu items and nudged the company to expand its beverage lineup. McDonald\u2019s has opened a handful of beverage-focused CosMc\u2019s locations in part to experiment with new drink combinations.\n\n--With assistance from Brett Pulley.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "Papa John\u2019s International, Inc. PZZA recorded mixed first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top and the bottom line declined on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nFollowing the results, the company\u2019s shares fell 6.8% during trading hours on May 9. Negative investor sentiments were witnessed as the company cited sales pressure in the short term due to the persistent challenging macroeconomic conditions and a decline in consumer confidence. For 2024, the company anticipates North America comps to be flat to down low single digits.\n\nEarnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nDuring the fiscal first quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 67 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. The company reported an adjusted EPS of 68 cents in the prior-year quarter.\n\nPapa John's International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Papa John's International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nPapa John's International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Papa John's International, Inc. Quote\n\nQuarterly revenues of $513.9 million missed the consensus mark of $546 million. The top line declined 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. The downside was primarily driven by lower contributions in the North American commissary segment owing to lower transaction volumes and commodity price declines.\n\nGlobal Restaurant Sales & Comps\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, total comparable sales declined 2% year over year compared with a 1.3% fall reported in the prior year quarter. We projected the metric to decline 4% year over year.\r\n\r\nDomestic company-owned restaurant comps in the quarter under review declined 3% year over year against 3.4% growth reported in the year-ago quarter. We projected the metric to fall 5.5% year over year.\r\n\r\nAt North America franchised restaurants, comps fell 1.5% year over compared with a 0.8% decline reported in the year-ago quarter.

Equity forfeitures, savings in local marketing and improved margins in Domestic company-owned restaurants and North America commissary segments primarily drove the increase. However, this was partially offset by the impact of the U.K. franchisee acquisition, higher depreciation costs related to the acquisition and technology investments and lower North America comparable sales.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter under review, total costs and expenses amounted to $480.2 million compared with $489.3 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $505.9 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $27.8 million compared with $40.6 million as of Dec 31, 2023.

The upside can be attributed to robust total system sales growth and new unit contribution.\n\nDuring the quarter, YUMC reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 71 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents. The bottom line moved up 2.9% from 69 cents reported a year ago.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2.96 billion outpaced the consensus mark of $2.94 billion.

        "content": "Finding opportunities amid volatility is crucial for those pursuing growth and stability when uncertainty clouds the market. The first company, a fintech giant, leads with increasing revenue growth, transaction volume, and strategic international expansion. The second one is a formidable force in the e-commerce space, holding onto its market dominance in China.\n\nMoreover, the fourth one shows off a solid order book and a dedication to quality in the face of difficulties, while the third one comes into the limelight with a growing Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) sector and strategic content pipeline growth. The sixth company\u2019s global expansion and healthy comparable sales growth underline its resilience, while the fifth company\u2019s steady revenue growth and strong loyalty program solidify its position. The seventh company\u2019s innovative and widely used products in the semiconductor industry have increased revenue and market share, demonstrating its adaptability and strength.\n\nThese cheap companies offer investors attractive chances because of their solid fundamentals, calculated moves, and potential for development in various industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUndervalued Stocks Near Yearly Lows: PayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (PYPL) reported 9% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in constant dollars or 10% of 7.7 billion for Q1 2024. Total payment volume hit $403.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14% in dollars, and payment transactions grew 11% to 6.5 billion.\n\nAdditionally, development outlooks, especially on the continents of Europe and Asia, show a 17% YOY growth in international TPV on a currency-neutral basis, also confirming PayPal\u2019s strong global presence.\n\nAt the bottom line, non-GAAP EPS surged 27% from the past year to $1.08, while GAAP EPS was up 18% to 83 cents. In Q124, at a dearer valuation, PayPal repurchased nearly 25 million common shares for $1.5 billion. Thus, the significant rise of both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS attests to PayPal\u2019s inherent ability to translate top-line expansion into a more resilient bottom line. It\u2019s just a great way to create value for the shareholder.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaobao and Tmall Group (TTG) constitute Alibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) primary e-commerce business activities.\u00a0This\u00a0has seen consistent, massive growth. Despite the fierce competition in the industry, Alibaba continues to hold the top spot among Chinese consumers. Moreover, TTG has announced a\u00a0robust gross merchandise volume (GMV) increase YOY.\u00a0This\u00a0is primarily due to successfully implementing competitive and user-focused pricing strategies. The volume of orders and the number of active purchasers have increased significantly.\u00a0This\u00a0demonstrates the platform\u2019s continued popularity and customer confidence.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the platform\u2019s position in the market\u00a0is further reflected\u00a0in the size of its merchant base, which\u00a0is growing at a\u00a0double-digit rate. This development pattern demonstrates Alibaba\u2019s capacity to draw in and keep merchants, which\u00a0is essential for preserving a wide range of products. Alibaba understands that maintaining its competitive advantage requires investing in\u00a0key\u00a0competencies.\n\nIn short, to improve the shopping experience for customers, the company is prioritizing investments in\u00a0important\u00a0areas. These include product availability, competitive prices, and excellent service.\n\nUndervalued Stocks Near Yearly Lows: Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of Q4 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s (NASDAQ:WBD) D2C sector had expanded to have nearly 98 million members. International markets were\u00a0fundamental\u00a0to counterbalance local decreases in subscriber growth.\u00a0Indeed, Warner Bros. Discovery profited from the expansion of streaming advertising despite difficulties in the markets for linear advertising. Revenues from D2C advertising surged by more than 50% in Q4 over Q3. Growth in ad-lite subscribers and great Max engagement both contributed to this acceleration.\n\nMoreover, Warner Bros. Discovery concentrated on improving revenue and segmentation by introducing new ad-supported products, among other measures. Worldwide expansion and strategic alliances, such as the introduction of Max in\u00a0important\u00a0markets like Europe and Latin America, also aided growth and revenue diversification.\n\nFinally, the company focuses on restoring the popularity of beloved properties like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and Superman. It channels investments into new spin-offs, sequels, and collaborations with influential artists to capitalize on the intrinsic worth of these properties and promote long-term growth.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nDespite temporary difficulties, Boeing\u2019s (NYSE:BA) backlog of over 5,600 commercial aircraft increased to $529 billion, suggesting a\u00a0substantial\u00a0market for its goods. Boeing\u2019s goods are trusted by the firm, as seen by the 125 net orders it received in the first quarter, including large orders from important clients like American Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines. Thus, efficient backlog management provides stability and visibility of the top-line, laying the groundwork for future expansion and profitability.\n\nAdditionally, Boeing has demonstrated a focus on upholding the highest standards throughout its operations by taking a\u00a0proactive approach to resolving quality and safety problems, especially in the wake of the Alaska Airlines tragedy. Overall, Boeing demonstrates its focus on ensuring the safety and reliability of its aircraft through actions that support investigations, enhance factory discipline, involve employees, and establish quality control procedures.\n\nUndervalued Stocks Near Yearly Lows: McDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nIn constant currency, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) consolidated revenues climbed by more than 4%. McDonald\u2019s sales rise shows that the company can make a sizable profit and develop internationally. McDonald\u2019s has demonstrated successful implementation of its strategic growth strategy. This includes activities like menu innovation, marketing campaigns, and expansion efforts.\n\nFurther, for the last twelve-month period and the quarter, systemwide sales to loyalty members across 50 loyalty markets were close to $25 billion and over $6 billion, respectively. The substantial sales contribution made by McDonald\u2019s loyalty members to the company\u2019s overall sales shows how well the loyalty program works to increase consumer engagement and encourage repeat business. Hence, McDonald\u2019s capacity to sustain customer loyalty, raise lifetime value, and promote sustainable top-line growth indicates high systemwide sales from devoted customers.\n\nFinally, for the first quarter of 2024, McDonald\u2019s recorded an adjusted operating margin of around 45%. Strong profitability\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in the\u00a08% growth in consolidated operating income in constant currency. Even with obstacles like higher expenses, McDonald\u2019s continued to have strong profit margins.\n\nLululemon (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nWith full net revenue rising 16% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 and the top-line improving by 19% 2023 over 2022, Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) has posted continued growth in consolidated revenues. Specifically, channels, stores, e-commerce, and geographies from the Americas to Mainland China and the rest of the world have balanced this growth well.\n\nThe company\u2019s international segment performed robustly, registering a 58% increase in revenue on a constant currency basis for all of 2023 compared to 2022 while growing by 54% in Q4 2023 over Q4 2022. Hence, Lululemon has been performing relatively well in foreign countries.\n\nIn Q4 2023, comparable sales climbed by\u00a012% over Q4 2022. Similarly, comparable sales in the Americas were up 7%, and overseas comparable sales rose 43% (or 44% on a constant currency basis). Further, there were gains of 8% in the Americas and 35% (39% on a constant dollar basis) in overseas markets. Therefore, this constant rise in comparative sales highlights the company\u2019s strong brand loyalty and customer engagement efforts.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nConcentrating on Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) top-line growth and market share expansion, revenue in Q1 2024 reached $12.7 billion, a 9% YOY increase. Additionally, Intel Products had a 17% YOY increase in revenue to $11.9 billion. The company anticipated more revenue in H2 2024. Moreover, growth in Intel\u2019s revenue shows that it sharply hit market demand and increased its market share, especially in the client and data center areas. Thus, Intel\u2019s stable top-line growth indicates the company\u2019s lead in the semiconductor industry, reflecting Intel\u2019s ability to adapt to changing client demands.\n\nSimilarly, looking at product adoption and innovation, since December 2023, more than\u00a05 million AI PCs have been shipped. The Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerator was introduced. In the future, Granite Rapids is scheduled for release in Q3. An announcement on the Open Platform for Enterprise AI has also\u00a0been made. Hence, Intel demonstrates its dedication to innovation through the substantial quantity of AI PCs sold and the release of cutting-edge AI accelerators and platforms.\n\nOverall, by meeting the increasing market need for AI-powered solutions, these products strengthen Intel\u2019s position as a market leader and give it a competitive edge.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PYPL, BABA, WBD and INTC.

        "content": "In the late 1970s, Louis Navellier \u2013 then a college student, now a senior analyst at InvestorPlace \u2013 accidentally beat the market. By running financial data through a Wells Fargo mainframe computer (an enormous privilege at the time!), he came across a model that beat the S&P 500 by a considerable margin.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s developed his system into Portfolio Grader, a quantitative stock-picking system that has trounced the market. It\u2019s found picks like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at $6\u2026 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at under $1\u2026\n\nIn fact, every dollar invested in Louis\u2019s A-graded stocks in 1998 would have risen fiftyfold by 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese quantitative systems are generally focused on finding stocks for the long run. We\u2019re not asking these systems to predict what\u2019s going to happen next week\u2026 let alone the next 24 hours.\n\nAnd that matters. Especially if you\u2019re an options trader\u2026 active investor\u2026 or even a long-term buyer seeking a better entry price. In these cases, it\u2019s essential to know when stocks will rise (and not just which ones).\n\nThat\u2019s where AI trading systems like TradeSmith\u2019s Predictive Alpha come in. These systems analyze hundreds of technical aspects, scouring share prices and volume metrics for \u201cclues\u201d of trader intent. (If you\u2019re a $10 billion fund selling $100 million of stock in a company that only has $50 million of average turnover a day\u2026 you\u2019re going to influence prices no matter what.)\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited this week to introduce Jonathan Rose, a veteran trader who has mastered the ins and outs of these types of trades. In his latest Masters in Trading presentation, he outlines the strategies, indicators, and other market clues he uses to notch returns of 197%\u2026 317%\u2026 even 1,147% in 30 days or less.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019d like to leave you with five tactical picks from TradeSmith\u2019s Predictive Alpha system that our writers at InvestorPlace.com \u2013 our free news and analysis site \u2013 also have highlighted this week.\n\nThese are five companies we expect will do well over the next 30 days, which makes them the ideal \u201cbuy the dip\u201d stocks for a recovering market.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTradeSmith\u2019s Predictive Alpha ranks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as its top pick this week, projecting a 3.6% return over the next 30 days. (That translates to a 52% annualized rate thanks to compounding). The quantitative system sees Nvidia\u2019s recent 15% selloff as overdone.\n\nIt\u2019s admittedly been difficult for investors to stomach Nvidia\u2019s sky-high prices. Even though my own models project that shares could be worth $1,600 by 2027, the company\u2019s eyewatering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios make it seem like an enormous bet on a future that may never arrive.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, Nvidia\u2019s recent pullback now puts prices back into more \u201cnormal\u201d territory. Shares now trade at 25 times 2026 earnings \u2013 not far from the average S&P 500 firm. And Ian Cooper writes at InvestorPlace.com that these lower prices present a compelling buying opportunity:\n\nNvidia could see even more upside with the AI and metaverse boom. After climbing to a high of $967.66, it\u2019s now back to $830.41. This weakness could be a long-term opportunity. From that last traded price, I\u2019d like to see NVDA run well above $1,000 a share this year.\n\nStrong results from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are also making a bullish case. Last Thursday, the smartphone chipmaker announced that earnings had surged 37% to $2.3 billion, driven by record automotive revenues and strong AI demand. This comes as a stark contrast to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, which had previously announced worse-than-expected Q1 results.\n\nThat tells us that the \u201cAI chip slowdown\u201d seen by some Nvidia rivals are company-specific issues. Nvidia itself continues to score a top A grade in Louis\u2019s Portfolio Grader, and rising analyst earnings estimates suggests that a near-term recovery will soon be underway.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPredictive Alpha similarly rates Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as a perfect \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d stock. The system forecasts a 3.1% upside over the next month.\n\nIn short, investors have become increasingly pessimistic about how much Meta will have to invest in data centers and AI \u2013 capital-intensive projects that will yield few immediate results. Wall Street analysts have quietly trimmed their target prices by $5 since last month.\n\nHowever, Meta is now seeing a surge in its core advertising business, with ad volume growth outpacing user growth almost threefold. As Yiannis Zourmpanos puts it in an article on InvestorPlace.com:\n\nA 6% increase in the average price per ad YOY suggests that Meta\u2019s advertising platform is now more efficiently monetized\u2026\n\nLooking forward, Meta will continue to expand its income by investing in data analytics, ad targeting skills, and advertising technologies. Therefore, ad impressions and average ad pricing will continue to rise due to the company\u2019s emphasis on increasing user engagement, growing the ad inventory, and boosting ad relevancy.\n\nElection years are typically excellent periods for advertisers, and we\u2019re seeing old patterns play out at Meta Platforms.\n\nEven better, Meta\u2019s stock currently trades for just 22 times forward earnings, making it one of the cheapest \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock by that metric. Though Wall Street might seem bearish about Meta\u2019s near-term prospects, our quant systems suggest the selloff has now gone too far.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn April, InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Marc Guberti highlighted Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) as a stock to buy whenever the market falters:\n\nRising profit margins and a solid moat are strengthening the company\u2019s long-term prospects. Analysts are bullish on the stock and rated it as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The average price target suggests an 11% upside.\n\nEssentially, Intuit is an \u201cevergreen\u201d stock that tends to make money in both good times and bad. Over the past three recessions, Intuit saw revenues rise double digits as consumers traded down for cheaper online accounting services. And during good times, Intuit also does well as small businesses migrate from pen-and-paper bookkeeping to digitized services like QuickBooks.\n\nA recent selloff in tech stocks now provides us with that market \u201cfalter\u201d we\u2019ve been waiting for. Shares of Intuit have now fallen 8% from their peak, which puts it near the top of Predictive Alpha\u2019s list. The quantitative stock-picking system believes shares will recover 3.1% over the next 30 days.\n\nIntuit is expected to announce strong results on May 23. The IRS only began accepting returns on Jan. 29 this year, and so much of Intuit\u2019s early season tax business will be pushed into its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expect revenues to rise 9% to $6.6 billion, and for earnings per share to surge 10% to $9.36. These are phenomenal growth rates for a mature blue-chip firm.\n\nIntuit also earns a high score in both Portfolio Grader (where it scores a \u201cB\u201d), signaling long-term gains to come. The firm is highly profitable and fast-growing, and its recent decline in short interest suggests that bears are beginning to throw in the towel. That makes the tax software firm a rarity: a stock that\u2019s attractive to both short- and long-term investors.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Tuesday, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and a host of other large brands warned that consumers were \u201cstarting to crack.\u201d Rising inflation and dwindling savings have begun to impact demand. Starbucks (NYSE:SBUX) also has felt the pinch \u2013 same-store-sales declined 3% in Q2.\n\nThat perhaps makes Target (NYSE:TGT) the strangest short-term pick by Predictive Alpha this week. Shares of the retailer are expected to rise 3.1% over the next 30 days, bucking a broader trend of negative consumer news.\n\nThere are several reasons for optimism. As Josh Enomoto notes at InvestorPlace.com, Target is more rock-solid than most realize:\n\nA big-box retailer, Target may face pressure amid the broader economic anxieties. However, as far as its direct peers are concerned, the only consumer base that features a higher average income is the one undergirding Costco.\n\nSecond, Target is also better shielded from the yo-yo demand that has put firms like Starbucks on the defensive. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target, and as the saying goes, \u201cwe\u2019ve all got to eat.\u201d\n\nFinally, InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Will Ashworth writes that Target is one of the few firms that has added significant headcount over the past five years and maintained strong returns on invested capital. It\u2019s a faster-growing firm than most realize, and Ashworth previously recommended shares as a bargain buy when TGT traded at around $126.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) A hand holds up the Airbnb (ABNB) logo outside a home in Estonia.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Predictive Alpha highlights Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) this week for its 3% expected return over the next 30 days, a 43% annualized rate of return.\n\nShares of Airbnb are only slightly higher today than when it first went public in 2020. The novelty of home rentals has worn off, and the firm has only managed to meet sky-high IPO expectations, not exceed them.\n\nHowever, this flattish long-term performance masks some incredible moves in Airbnb\u2019s stock. In April 2022, a delayed Covid-19 exit sent shares plummeting 40%. A recovery in tech stocks and consumer demand has since reversed that loss.\n\nJeremy Flint, as he writes at InvestorPlace.com, now believes a bookings boom is set to put Airbnb back on a faster track of growth:\n\nAirbnb\u2019s user base is returning to the platform\u2019s original concept of offering spare space as a budget-friendly alternative to hotels. Despite facing significant challenges, such as a $10 million fine for misleading international customers by listing prices in USD rather than local currencies, Airbnb\u2019s market dominance remains unchallenged\u2026\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Airbnb disclosed nearly a 17% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 15% rise in gross booking value. Spurred by the holiday travel surge, this growth is expected to continue as we move into the spring and summer travel seasons.\n\nSince September, Airbnb has seen the number of shares sold short decline from 34.8 million to just 16.6 million \u2013 a 52% drop.\n\nStocks for the Long Short Run\n\nIn 1994, economist Jeremy Siegel published Stocks for the Long Run, an investment tome that was often referred to as \u201cthe buy and hold Bible.\u201d By investing in the U.S. stock market and holding on for extended periods, even ordinary investors could turn small investments into vast fortunes.\n\nHowever, critics have since pointed out that not every investor has a 40-plus year investment horizon. Some might not even have five years. And the incredible run that U.S. stock markets saw in the 20th century might fail to repeat in modern times. America, after all, saw its economy move from a middling one to the world\u2019s greatest superpower during this period. (Buy-and-hold investors in Turkey, Argentina, and China have done far worse).\n\nThat means investing in the 21st century will need some combination of long-term investing paired with tactical trading. Nvidia might be a phenomenal long-term stock\u2026 but is $700 a good entry price? $800? $1,000?\n\nThat\u2019s where Jonathan Rose\u2019s Masters in Trading Summit comes in.

        "title": "Decoding McDonald's Corp (MCD): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "McDonald's Corp showcases robust financial growth with a 4.6% increase in total revenues. Net income rises to $1,929 million, marking a 7% improvement over the previous year. Strategic franchising and global brand strength continue to drive McDonald's success. Investments in digital innovation and global expansion underscore future growth opportunities.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MCD.\n\nOn May 8, 2024, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) released its 10-Q filing, revealing a comprehensive financial performance for the first quarter of the year. The company, known for its global dominance in the fast-food industry, reported a notable increase in total revenues from $5,898 million in 2023 to $6,169 million in 2024, a 4.6% year-over-year growth. This financial upswing is further evidenced by a 7% rise in net income, climbing from $1,802 million to $1,929 million. The earnings per share (EPS) also saw an uptick, with basic EPS rising from $2.47 to $2.67 and diluted EPS from $2.45 to $2.66. These figures underscore McDonald's Corp's financial resilience and its ability to maintain profitability amidst a dynamic market landscape. Decoding McDonald's Corp (MCD): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nGlobal Brand and Market Presence: McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) continues to leverage its iconic brand, which is synonymous with fast-food across the globe. The company's brand strength is a critical asset, contributing to its $130 billion in system sales across nearly 42,000 stores. The brand's widespread recognition facilitates customer loyalty and consistent traffic, a testament to its enduring appeal and marketing prowess. McDonald's strategic marketing initiatives, such as \"Feel-Good Marketing,\" resonate with customers worldwide, reinforcing the brand's relevance and emotional connection.\n\nFranchising Model Efficiency: McDonald's Corp's franchising model is a cornerstone of its financial strength. Approximately 60% of its revenue stems from franchise royalty fees and lease payments, a testament to the model's success. This structure not only minimizes operational risks but also ensures a stable and predictable revenue stream. The company's strategic co-investments with franchisees in restaurant improvements and operating systems further enhance the brand's value and drive performance across the franchise network.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Franchisees: While McDonald's Corp's franchising model is a strength, it also presents a vulnerability. The company's performance is heavily reliant on its franchisees' success, which can be influenced by various factors beyond corporate control, such as local market conditions and management effectiveness. Any misalignment or inconsistency in operations among franchisees could potentially tarnish the brand's reputation and impact overall performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket Saturation Risks: McDonald's Corp operates in a highly competitive and mature market, where growth opportunities may be limited by market saturation. As the company seeks to expand its global footprint, it may encounter challenges in finding new markets or increasing market share in existing ones without cannibalizing sales from current locations. This saturation also intensifies competition, putting pressure on McDonald's to continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its market position.\n\nOpportunities\n\nDigital Innovation and Customer Engagement: McDonald's Corp has identified digital innovation as a key driver for future growth. The company's investments in digital platforms, including mobile ordering, loyalty programs, and personalized marketing, are designed to enhance customer engagement and convenience. By expanding its digital capabilities, McDonald's aims to attract a younger demographic and create a more seamless customer experience, which could lead to increased sales and customer loyalty.\n\nGlobal Expansion and New Markets: Despite the challenges of market saturation, McDonald's Corp sees significant growth potential in international markets. The company's plans to open more than 2,100 new restaurants in 2024 reflect its ambition to tap into emerging markets and capitalize on global urbanization trends. By strategically entering new territories and optimizing its restaurant footprint, McDonald's can continue to expand its global presence and drive systemwide sales growth.\n\nThreats\n\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Uncertainties: McDonald's Corp operates in a complex global environment where macroeconomic and geopolitical factors can significantly impact its business. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, trade policies, and political instability in key markets can affect the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The ongoing war in the Middle East, for instance, has already had a slight negative impact on the International Developmental Licensed Markets segment's comparable sales.\n\nChanging Consumer Preferences and Health Trends: As consumer preferences evolve, particularly towards healthier and more sustainable options, McDonald's Corp must adapt its menu offerings to stay relevant. The fast-food industry faces increasing scrutiny over nutritional content, sourcing practices, and environmental impact. McDonald's needs to continuously innovate its menu and supply chain practices to meet these changing demands and mitigate the risk of losing market share to competitors who may be quicker to respond to such trends.\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) demonstrates a strong financial and strategic position in its latest SEC 10-Q filing. The company's robust brand, efficient franchising model, and strategic investments in digital innovation position it well for continued success. However, reliance on franchisees, market saturation, macroeconomic uncertainties, and evolving consumer preferences present ongoing challenges. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, McDonald's can capitalize on opportunities and navigate threats, ensuring its place as a leader in the global fast-food industry.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "The restaurant industry is difficult. Competition is fierce. Consumers are picky. Workers are transitory. And profit margins can be razor thin. The National Restaurant Association estimates that only 20% of restaurants are successful. About 60% of all restaurants fail in their first year of operation, and 80% fail within five years of opening. Those are some depressing statistics and they help to explain why many restaurant stocks chronically underperform the broader market. Currently, there\u2019s quite a long list of restaurant stocks to avoid.\n\nA lot of restaurant stocks have missed out on the rally of the past 18 months. While tech stocks zoomed ahead, many restaurant companies have seen their share price stuck in the mud, unable to gain any traction or forward momentum. Higher prices prompted by inflation have forced many consumers to eat at home, hurting the financial results and stock performance of restaurant chains and companies. Slowing economic growth at home in the U.S. and abroad has further complicated matters.\n\nAs you update your portfolio to take into account current trends, don\u2019t get caught holding these three restaurant stocks to avoid.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurant\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe stock of Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) is down nearly 10% on the year as the company continues to report mixed financial results and a decline in same-store sales. Darden, which owns franchise restaurants such as Olive Garden and LongHornSteakhouse, most recently announced earnings per share (EPS) of $2.62, which met Wall Street forecasts. Revenue totaled $2.97 billion, which fell short of the $3.03 billion expected among analysts. The company\u2019s sales rose 6.8% from a year earlier.\n\nDarden\u2019s executive team stressed that the company\u2019s sales got a lift from its acquisition last year of Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, which provided it with 53 new restaurant locations. However, overall same-store sales decreased 1% in the quarter as nearly all restaurant segments reported same-store sales declines. A year ago, Darden reported same-store sales growth of 12%. Management lowered their revenue forecast for this year to $11.4 billion from $11.5 billion previously.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nNothing seems to be able to move the stock of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). Not a new plan to sell Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) doughnuts at its outlets nationwide, and not a growth strategy that will see the Golden Arches open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. Despite all these efforts, MCD stock is down 10% on the year and languishing. Mixed first-quarter financial results didn\u2019t help the share price any.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s warned that consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending and said that boycotts continue to hurt its sales in the Middle East. It announced EPS of $2.70 versus $2.72 that was expected among analysts. Revenue in Q1 of this year came in at $6.17 billion compared to $6.16 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Global same-store sales rose 1.9% during the quarter, missing estimates of 2.1%. Management said that spending grew due to higher prices, but acknowledged that low-income customers are starting to avoid the restaurant chain.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee shop chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) deserves special mention as one of the top restaurant stocks to avoid as its latest financial results were arguably the worst of any restaurant company. Starbucks, which is known for its distinctive green aprons and lattes, announced a disastrous Q1 print that sent SBUX stock down 15% immediately. The share price is now trading 6% lower than where it was five years ago. The situation is so bad that it prompted former CEO Howard Schultz to come out of retirement and criticize the company on social media.\n\nSame-store sales fell 4% as traffic at Starbucks cafes declined 6% in the quarter. Analysts were anticipating same-store sales growth of 1%. Across all regions and markets, Starbucks reported declining same-store sales and customer traffic. In China, Starbucks\u2019 second-largest market, same-store sales plunged 11% year-over-year (YOY). Like McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks blamed its troubles on consumers pulling back on discretionary spending and on slowing economies in countries such as China.\n\nLooking ahead, Starbucks gave a glum outlook, lowering its forecast for both 2024 earnings and revenue, and saying that its outlets are likely to continue underperforming for several more quarters.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 future dividend kings in the next 5 years or less. You can skip our detailed analysis of the best dividend kings and the performance of dividend growth stocks, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 5 Years or Less.\n\nDividend Kings refer to a select group of companies that have consistently raised their dividends for at least 50 years. Growing dividends for half a century demands significant dedication and financial stability. Hence, only 54 out of 4,000 publicly traded companies in the US have managed to accomplish this feat of sustained dividend growth. Moreover, these companies have raised and maintained their dividends despite enduring seven recessions over the past five decades, including the Black Monday in 1987, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, and the Coronavirus Crash of 2020. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the best dividend kings with decades-long dividend growth streaks.\n\nCompanies that have the ability to raise their dividends have shown resilience and stability over time. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2005. According to a report by ProShares, the initial investment of $10,000 made in 2005 in the index could have potentially grown to over $61,000 by March 2021. Moreover, the index has surpassed the broader market in performance during eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005. The report also mentioned that the companies in the Dividend Aristocrats Index have grown their dividends at an annual average rate of 8.3% between 2005 and 2022, compared with a 6.7% annual average dividend growth rate of the S&P 500 companies.\n\nInvestors have been actively seeking dividend growth stocks because of their capacity to provide consistent and increasing income over time. As corporate balance sheets are showing strength, many companies in the US are steadily growing their dividends. According to the latest data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the companies in the S&P 500 distributed $151.6 billion in dividends in the first quarter of 2024, up from $146.8 billion during the same period last year. The report further mentioned that total dividend increases were $22.7 billion for the quarter, compared with $19.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, has given a strong outlook for dividend growth this year, especially for large-cap companies. Here is what he said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAbsent an economic or geopolitical event, dividend growth is expected to selectively continue. S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering uncertainty and volatility better. The index is expected to post a 6% increase in payments for 2024 compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and the 10.8% increase seen in 2022.\"\n\nGenerating income from dividend stocks is not a quick process; it mainly requires patience and a long-term investment approach. Dividend stocks are ideal for long-term investors as these equities have outpaced inflation over the years. Morningstar cited data from Yale University's Robert Shiller and revealed that since 1871, dividends per share in the S&P 500 have increased at an annualized rate of 1.6 percentage points faster than inflation. In addition to this, the advantage of dividend growth over inflation has strengthened in recent years. Over the past 50 years, dividends have surpassed inflation by an annualized rate of 2.5 percentage points, and over the last 20 years, by 4.6 percentage points annually.\n\nThat said, achieving dividend growth and that too, for such long periods of time, is not an easy task. However, there are some companies that are on the verge of achieving Dividend King status, showing their commitment to consistent dividend increases. In this article, we will take a look at future dividend kings in five years or less. 10 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 5 Years or Less\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 45 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies that increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years). These companies would be achieving their Dividend King status in five years or less. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.\n\nData from over 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)\n\nConsecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 45\n\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based paint and coating manufacturing company that also specializes in floor coverings and related products.

McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\n\nConsecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 47\n\nAn American multinational fast-food chain, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is next on our list of the best dividend kings of the future. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.49%, as recorded on May 8.

Among these hedge funds, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.\n\nHorizon Kinetics LLC mentioned McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cThe next major development for the industrialized economies was the opening of \u201cdenied areas.\u201d It\u2019s not a familiar term today, but it would be found in books on geopolitics written before the collapse of the Soviet Union. It referred to the Soviet Union and China, and simply meant that businesses couldn\u2019t expand there.\n\nFor instance, prior to 1990, it was inconceivable that someone would assert that McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was going to open a store in Moscow, or even Bucharest or Warsaw. But it ultimately happened. And then in Shanghai and other Chinese cities. So, in addition to the disinflationary commodity and labor impacts, the third miracle for Western economies was that all the major consumer brand companies that could only expand globally within the context of what we then called the free world, could now be truly global. Much expansion ensued, growth that could not otherwise have occurred\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -0.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share, indicating a change of -2.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $12.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2%. This estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.19 indicates a change of +8.3% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, McDonald's is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MCD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.65 billion and $28.27 billion estimates indicate +4.5% and +6.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $2.70 for the same period compares with $2.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.01%. The EPS surprise was -0.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, McDonald's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, McDonald's fair value estimate is US$292 With US$268 share price, McDonald's appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for MCD is US$315, which is 7.7% above our fair value estimate\n\nDoes the May share price for McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nThe Method\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$8.62b US$9.04b US$10.5b US$11.1b US$12.4b US$13.4b US$14.2b US$14.9b US$15.5b US$16.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x9 Analyst x9 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 7.71% Est @ 6.11% Est @ 4.99% Est @ 4.21% Est @ 3.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1%  US$8.0k US$7.7k US$8.3k US$8.1k US$8.4k US$8.4k US$8.2k US$8.0k US$7.7k US$7.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$80b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$16b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (8.1%\u2013 2.4%) = US$286b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$286b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$131b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$211b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$268, the company appears about fair value at a 8.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.252. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for McDonald's\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For McDonald's, we've compiled three essential factors you should consider:\n\nRisks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with McDonald's (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

        "content": "The recent Fed meeting has boosted consumer confidence in an expected rate cut later in the year. Given the high volatility in the stock market over the past few weeks, investors are looking for sectors other than technology.\u00a0An\u00a0improvement in the economy\u00a0is directly related\u00a0to consumer spending\u00a0and\u00a0some of the best restaurant stocks will be the first\u00a0ones\u00a0to benefit.\n\nHaving shown resilience throughout the high inflation\u00a0periods, restaurant stocks have been standing\u00a0strong. Consumer spending at restaurants increased in 2023\u00a0as\u00a0compared to the prior year\u00a0and\u00a0I believe this improvement will continue throughout 2024. I have chosen the best restaurant stocks to buy and hold for long-term gains. These are exceptional companies with a global presence and have already impressed investors with solid fundamentals.\n\nTake a bite of these delicious restaurant stocks this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\u00a0(MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the\u00a0first-quarter results didn\u2019t\u00a0do much good to McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD)\u00a0stock, there is a reason to bet your money on it. The fast food giant has become one of the best-known global names\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0is reporting steady growth.\u00a0Its revenue increased 5%\u00a0in the quarter\u00a0to $6.2 billion\u00a0and\u00a0the adjusted EPS increased 2% to $2.70.\u00a0The global comparable sales increased by 1.9%.\n\nThe company has been making changes in its offerings\u00a0and\u00a0this has led\u00a0to success since the beginning of the year.\u00a0It has improved the\u00a0quality\u00a0and\u00a0taste\u00a0and also enhanced\u00a0delivery services.\u00a0Since the management saw a drop in traffic to its restaurants, it will have to remain vigilant about the prices.\u00a0An improvement in consumer spending, however,\u00a0could help the business see higher revenue growth.\n\nIf you look at the bigger picture,\u00a0McDonald\u2019s\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0have much to worry about. Its franchise income is steadily growing\u00a0and\u00a0the company\u00a0is aiming\u00a0to test a\u00a0larger\u00a0burger this year. With\u00a0strong\u00a0fundamentals and a global presence, MCD will continue to stand tall in the competitive industry.\n\nTrading at $269 today, the stock is down 9% year-to-date. It enjoys a dividend yield of 2.48% and is an ideal stock for passive income investors. If you found MCD expensive earlier, now is your time to pounce on this restaurant stock. The stock has also suffered due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and the boycotts in the region. However, the pullback in the stock is a chance to make your move.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino\u2019s\u00a0Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nA clear winner of the earnings season,\u00a0Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)\u00a0 had an excellent quarter despite the inflation concerns. The first-quarter results beat analyst estimates as the company reported a revenue of $1.08 billion. Its EPS stood at $3.58\u00a0and\u00a0the sales increased 6% YoY.\u00a0 Its quarterly net income grew 20% YoY to $126 million.\u00a0The same-store sales\u00a0grew\u00a05.6% in the U.S.\u00a0and\u00a0this growth was\u00a0driven by delivery orders.\n\nThe strong results led the stock up 6%\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0is now trading for $522, up 16% YTD and 69% in the past 12 months.\u00a0It has been slowly but steadily moving upwards\u00a0and has gone from\u00a0$308 to $522 today.\u00a0I\u2019d\u00a0recommended\u00a0buying the stock in September\u00a0and\u00a0if you had bought it\u00a0then,\u00a0you would be sitting on gains of 32%.\n\nIts pricing techniques and menu offerings make it possible for the company to achieve positive same-store sales growth and see higher revenue numbers. The company saw a\u00a0strong\u00a0improvement in sales at over 20,000 outlets globally and aims to open 1,100 stores by 2028. An increase in stores will lead to an improvement in sales and revenue in the coming years.\n\nIts marketing efforts with the improved loyalty program are paying off in addition to the quick service time that helped increase orders.\u00a0Yes, the stock\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0cheap and is trading at a premium today\u00a0but\u00a0if you wait for it to dip, you could be waiting forever. DPZ stock has a dividend yield of 1.16%.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMy all-time favorite restaurant stock to own, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG),\u00a0will not disappoint you.\u00a0Trading at $3,199 today, the stock is up 42% YTD and 57% in the past 12 months. The\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0first-quarter results were mind-blowing, and it has announced a stock split of 50-for-1\u00a0which\u00a0has made it even more attractive.\n\nThe stock will split on June 25\u00a0and\u00a0the shares will start trading on June 26.\u00a0This\u00a0was an attempt to make the stock appealing to investors, and with the stock trading over $3,000, this was\u00a0a\u00a0necessary\u00a0move.\u00a0This\u00a0is another stock I had\u00a0recommended buying in October when it was trading for $1,837. You could be sitting on 74% gains today.\n\nThe company saw a 14% increase in sales to $2.7 billion, and comparable sales rose 7%. The company is\u00a0making an entry in\u00a0Kuwait in a partnership with Alshaya Group to launch its first shop. A timely move, the Middle East brings massive expansion opportunities for Chipotle.\n\nThe company has put up monster returns in the past\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0can do so again. It has impressed the market\u00a0and\u00a0the stock split could be a good chance\u00a0for you\u00a0to add the stock to your portfolio. The stock will trade at a lower value after the split.\n\nWhile it will make no difference to the shareholder value, it will become more affordable. It is trading close to $3,000 today\u00a0and\u00a0after the split, it could be trading near $60. I love the stock and think\u00a0that the\u00a0split is\u00a0a good\u00a0opportunity to add it to your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "First-quarter earnings continued to come in better than expected last week, but it was the latest Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting which led to a pop in markets in the second half of the week. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out a rate hike at the next meeting, downplayed stagflation concerns and announced the central bank would slow the pace of balance sheet reductions, a move widely seen as a slight easing of monetary policy.[1]\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SRE.\n\nRate cut hopes were raised even further on Friday when U.S. jobs data for April came in weaker than expected. Nonfarm Payrolls totaled 175,000, well below the Dow Jones consensus of 240,000. Unemployment, which has stayed consistently low, rose to 3.9%.[2] All major U.S. indices ended the day up 1 - 2% on the news.\n\nOn the earnings front, all eyes were on two more of the Magnificent 7 names, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Amazon surpassed both top and bottom-line expectations, driven by strength in ad revenue which increased 24% YoY, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) which grew 17%.[3] Apple was able to beat on earnings estimates, but missed on revenues as iPhone sales sunk 10% during the quarter.[4] Despite that disappointing result, which CEO Tim Cook blamed on difficult year-over-year comparisons, the tech behemoth showed there is no shortage of cash when they announced a $110 billion buyback, the largest-ever in history. The stock shot up 6% in after-hours trading.\n\nOn the flipside, there were some consumer-centric names that didn't fare well when they reported Q1 results last week. Results from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)[5], McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)[6] and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM)[7] all showed that U.S. consumers were starting to hold back on dining out. All three missed on bottom-line expectations, while only McDonald's squeaked by on the top line. Consumers have remained resilient in the face of higher prices in the last two years, but inflation may finally be taking its toll.\n\nWith 80% of S&P 500 names reporting thus far, year-over-year earnings growth stands at 5% according to data from FactSet.[8] That's with 77% of companies surpassing analyst expectations, above the 10-year average, on par with the five-year average and just a little lighter than the one-year average of 78%. Revenues are still light, with only 61% of companies beating on the top-line, showing that many names are continuing to cost-cut their way to profitability.\n\nOn deck the last peak week of the first-quarter season\n\nThis week we get a smattering of results from different sectors, with 3,507 companies expected to report in total, the most of any week this season. Popular names to watch include Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) on Monday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Tuesday and Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues The Final Peak Week of the 1st-Quarter Season Begins Just as Earnings Hit Their Stride\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[9]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their first-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Nine companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Loews Corp. (NYSE:L), Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE:WMB), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Assurant Inc. (NYSE:AIZ), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) and NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis week will mark the final peak week of the first-quarter earnings season with 3,507 companies set to report. May 9 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,236 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 42% of companies have reported (out of our universe of 10,000-plus global names).

        "content": "Stretched consumers are getting pickier in the grocery aisles, leading to a weaker third quarter projection from meat giant Tyson Foods (TSN).\n\nOn Monday, the company posted mixed earnings results and projected a weaker Q3, as executives signaled a more challenging environment for consumers, who are \"a little bit under pressure,\" CEO Donnie King told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The consumer is experiencing inflation, for housing, for utilities, for virtually everything in the economy and one that is really concerning, is around consumer debt,\" King said over the phone.\n\nOther factors that led to weaker guidance include limited beef cattle availability that could bleed over into next fiscal year, and higher commodity costs.\n\nWhile King tried to point part of the projected numbers on seasonality within pork and prepared foods, and said the company may have \"overcooked\" the weaker guidance to Yahoo Finance, investors are not buying it.\n\nTyson's shares closed down nearly 6% after dropping as much as 9% during the trading session. Year-to-date, shares up more than 7%, trailing S&P 500's (^GSPC) 10% gain.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that the lower income consumers is feeling more stretched than others right now,\" CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram said. Other companies, like McDonald's (MCD), has also pointed to a pullback in spending.\n\nSundaram said the third-quarter is \"usually the strongest quarter\" when it comes to Tyson's margins, \"We thought next quarter would be a strong one, but...their tone is a bit cautious.\"\n\nFor Tyson, overall volumes dropped 1.5% in the second quarter, with a 2.8% increase for beef, 2.9% increase for pork, and 6.1% decline for chicken, as it closed six chicken facilities and \"retooled\" its demand model, per King.\n\nSundaram added, \"We're not seeing that corresponding uptick in the retail channel ... consumers are utilizing more leftovers winding down their pantries, cooking larger batch meals, as opposed to single serve meals, things like that.\"\n\nPrepared foods saw a 0.7% volume growth in Q3.\n\n\"If you look at the consumer ... [there is a] move away from fine dining or trade down from fine dining to casual dining, or QSR,\" King said, adding that diners are also moving to making meals at home.\n\nMelanie Boulden, who oversees the prepared food segment, said the company is losing slight market share to private labels among lower income households on the earnings call.\n\nKing said the company is positioned to match that demand too. But Sundaram warned that selling its own product is typically a boost to margins, versus manufacturing and selling private label.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut certain shoppers may completely pull back on protein, Sundaram predicts: \"Some consumers are essentially saying, I can't afford protein right now. \" (Courtesy: Tyson Foods)\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, the company revised its outlook.\n\nThe company now expects total operating income to come in between $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, compared to previous guidance of $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion, driven by improved outlook for chicken. For the chicken segment, adjusted operating income is expected to come in between $700 million to $900 million, compared to previous guidance of $500 to $700 million.\n\nKing said in Q2, the company saw \"better operational execution which led to better profitability,\" which includes closing some of its underperforming meat plants and moving the volume into more efficient locations.\n\n\"We're not done yet,\" King said, as the company continues to evaluate its operations.\n\n\u2014\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Wendy's (WEN) Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Lag",
        "content": "The Wendy's Company WEN reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. Solid same-restaurant sales and strength in U.S. breakfast sales and digital sales momentum aided the company\u2019s performance. Following the announcement, Wendy's shares moved up 1.5% during the trading session on May 2.\n\nQ1 Earnings & Revenues\n\nWEN reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 23 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. In the prior-year quarter, it reported adjusted EPS of 21 cents.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $534.8 million missed the consensus mark of $541 million. The top line inched up 1.1% on a year-over-year basis on the back of net new restaurant development and higher same-restaurant sales. Also, a rise in franchise royalty revenues and advertising funds revenues added to the upside.\n\nThe Wendy's Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Wendy's Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nThe Wendy's Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Wendy's Company Quote\n\nSame-restaurant sales at international restaurants (excluding Argentina) rose 3.2% year over year compared with 13.9% a year ago. Our estimate was 2.3%.\r\n\r\nComps at global restaurants rose 0.9% year over year compared with 8% in the prior-year quarter. Comps in the United States registered a 0.6% year-over-year improvement compared with 7.2% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, Wendy\u2019s inaugurated 35 restaurants globally, reflecting an increase of eight net new units.\n\nSystem-Wide Sales Discussion\n\nDuring the reported quarter, global system-wide sales \u2014 including company-operated and franchise restaurants \u2014 rose 2.6% year over year. System-wide sales in the U.S. and International segments were up 1.7% and 8.8% year over year, respectively.\n\nOperating Highlights\n\nDuring the quarter under review, the company-operated restaurant margin came in at 15.3% compared with 14.7% in the prior-year quarter. The upside was backed by a higher average check. This was partially offset by customer count declines and higher labor costs.\r\n\r\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $63.8 million compared with $62.3 million a year ago. The uptick can be primarily driven by an increase in stock compensation and an increase in employee compensation and benefits. However, this was partially offset by lower outside professional services. We projected the metric to be $65.8 million.\r\n\r\nQuarterly operating profit amounted to $81.2 million, down 3.9% from the year-ago levels. The downside was caused by incremental investment in breakfast advertising, higher depreciation, higher amortization of cloud-computing arrangement costs and higher general and administrative expenses. However, this was partially offset by higher franchise royalty revenues and an increase in U.S. company-operated restaurant margin.\r\n\r\nNet income was $42 million, up 5.5% from $39.8 million in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $127.8 million, up 1.8% from $125.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily backed by higher franchise royalty revenues and an increase in U.S. company-operated restaurant margin. This was partially offset by an increase in the company's incremental investment in breakfast advertising and higher general and administrative expenses. Our projection was $128.1 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2024, totaled $498.3 million compared with $516 million on Dec 31, 2023. Inventories at the end of the fiscal first quarter amounted to $6.1 million compared with $6.7 million as of Dec 31, 2023. As of Mar 31, 2024, long-term debt was $2.72 billion compared with $2.73 billion at the end of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nManagement declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on Jun 17, 2024, to shareholders on record as of Jun 3, 2024.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nFor 2024, WEN expects global system-wide sales growth in the range of 5-6%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $535-$545 million. Adjusted EPS for 2024 is anticipated to be between $0.98 and $1.02.\r\n\r\nThe company suggests cash flow from operations in the band of $370-$390 million. Capital expenditures are envisioned to be between $90 million and $100 million. Free cash flow is forecast in the range of $280-$290 million.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWendy's currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRecent Retail-Wholesale Releases\n\nYum China Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "The 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy for Exponential Gains: Q2\u00a0Edition",
        "content": "We are officially in the middle of Q2 with the start of May, and it is also the earnings season for companies reporting their Q1 figures. Even though the market right now is not at its best, with bearish sentiments casting a dark cloud over Wall Street, I believe this is\u00a0a good\u00a0time to establish positions in some sturdy long-term stocks that can deliver \u201cexponential\u201d gains.\n\nThese stocks have grown along with the broader economy, and some have consistently beaten the S&P 500\u2018s returns, proving their mettle as steady compounders.\u00a0As the\u00a0old saying goes, \u201cTime in the market is better than timing the market.\u201d Any portfolio should contain at least a few of these stocks in their core to add ballast and significant upside potential in the long run. While the bears may continue to growl in the near term, these resilient picks have the fundamental strength to weather the storm and emerge victorious.\n\nOf course, the bearishness could cause some of these stocks to decline in the near term, as they often get caught in the undertow of market sell-offs. However, if you are looking to hold for the long run and have the patience to let the compounding work its magic,\u00a0all of\u00a0these long-term stocks are great buys right now at discounted valuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDescartes Systems Group (DSGX) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDescartes Systems (NASDAQ:DSGX) is a Canadian company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses. Even though the supply chain took many hits in the past few years and has been volatile, this company has\u00a0continued to deliver consistently\u00a0in the long run.\u00a0It did have short-term selloffs in 2021, along with\u00a0the broader market, but the long-term trend here has been stellar. DSGX chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nThe company provides software to the logistics industry,\u00a0so it generates\u00a0revenue from the booming logistics industry while being cushioned from direct shocks in the industry.\n\nThe stock is up 132% in the past year. It is one of the safest stocks you can buy, as it has 46 times more cash than debt, and its Altman-Z score of 22.2 puts it firmly in the \u201csafe\u201d category. Moreover, it had a 20.2% net margin last year,\u00a0which is\u00a0better than 91.5% of industry peers. The company has a growing cash pile, and I expect it to pay dividends in the coming years, further sweetening the pot for long-term investors.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is a no-brainer company, and\u00a0I think\u00a0it should be one of your\u00a0biggest\u00a0core holdings\u00a0by far, if not the biggest.\u00a0This company\u2019s biggest asset is Warren Buffett, of course. However, even if he\u00a0were to\u00a0not be with us in the coming years, I expect Berkshire to continue performing well. It has been the most stable major public holding company and has outperformed most of its peers by significant margins, including outperforming the S&P 500.

Brands (YUM) YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my articles, I often discuss McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) as one of the best compounders that are\u00a0also\u00a0recession-resistant. One company that comes\u00a0pretty\u00a0close is Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), which owns KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and The Habit Burger Grill, among others.\u00a0This company has been delivering solid returns decade after decade, and\u00a0I also think\u00a0it has similar upside potential.\n\nThe debt here is $12 billion compared to $512 million in cash,\u00a0so it\u00a0has been affected by rate hikes. However, margins have\u00a0held up, and the company has continued to post solid earnings. The net margin was 22.6% last year,\u00a0which is\u00a0better than 97% of restaurant companies. Yum brands net margin chart. long-term stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nMoreover, its 3-year revenue growth rate remained above double digits at 10.5%. The restaurant brands\u00a0owned by this company\u00a0are unlikely to go away anytime soon, making Yum Brands a tasty addition to any portfolio centered around long-term stocks.\n\nComfort Systems (FIX) A photo of the sun in a partly cloudy sky with an orange filter.\n\nSource: Ed Connor/ShutterStock.com\n\nHVAC stocks have been booming in recent quarters due to persistent heat waves\u00a0across the world.\u00a0If we see a heat wave in the U.S. similar to the one we saw last year,\u00a0I believe\u00a0investors who have their money in air conditioning companies will be laughing their way to the bank.\u00a0As the\u00a0old saying goes, \u201cMake hay while the sun shines,\u201d and Comfort Systems (NYSE:FIX) is well-positioned to capitalize on the sweltering conditions.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t expect a multibagger upside from these well-established companies, but they can deliver 30-40% in gains this year if it is\u00a0particularly hot. The performance here has been stellar already. It has been up 472% in the past five years and almost 100% in the past year.\u00a0I think it\u00a0can perform even better in the summer.

It also raised its quarterly dividend last week to 30 cents per share. Operating cash flow more than doubled from $302 million to $640 million from 2022 to 2023.

It is a very well-diversified business that has its hands on multiple industries. Roper also has shifted its focus to vertical SaaS businesses, resulting in higher margins and more predictable revenue. ROP stock chart. long-term stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nThe\u00a0biggest\u00a0windfall for the company has been the infrastructure spending and onshoring trends. Roper has seen significant growth in the post-COVID era due to this.\u00a0EBITDA has recovered from $1.57 billion in 2020 to $2.67 billion in 2023, and stimulus and spending for infrastructure have\u00a0seen no end\u00a0in sight.\n\nThe 3-year EPS growth (minus non-recurring items) is almost 38% annually on average. Analysts expect continuous EPS growth over the next decade from an estimated $18.2 in 2024 to $67 in 2033, which should lead to hefty compounding of its stock.\n\nWoodward (WWD) image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWoodward (NASDAQ:WWD) provides control system components for aircraft engines, industrial engines and turbines, power generation, and similar industrial equipment. As I have said before, on-shoring trends have\u00a0been fueling\u00a0infrastructure companies, and industrial companies have also been benefiting massively.\u00a0In my opinion,\u00a0Woodward is well-positioned to ride this wave of domestic manufacturing and infrastructure investment. WWD stock chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nWoodward finally surpassed its 2019 sales peak with a record $2.9 billion in revenue in 2023. However, margins are yet to catch up, but I am sure they will this year, as EPS\u00a0is expected\u00a0to increase by 42% along with 13.6% sales growth.\n\nWoodward also had its price target raised to $200 from $182 at Deutsche Bank and\u00a0raised\u00a0to $200 from $191 at UBS. Both maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock, which is up a solid 46% in the past year. It also beat Q1 top-line estimates by 3.3% and EPS estimates by 21.1%, and I expect it to continue beating sales estimates, as it has done so since Q4 2022.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is a well-known business, and it shouldn\u2019t take much explaining\u00a0as to\u00a0why this company is seeing consistent and stable growth that is \u201cexponential.\u201d It has been growing along with the economy for years. That\u2019s because both Mastercard and Visa (NYSE:V) have an extremely profitable duopoly. Mastercard\u2019s dominance among the two has remained steadfast.

The company also had a solid cash position of $9.2 billion,\u00a0and it\u00a0benefits no matter the macroeconomic environment as long as people make transactions. Mastercard benefits from high interest rates when rates are high, and it also benefits from the increased transaction volumes when rates\u00a0are cut\u00a0and people start spending again.\n\nIt might be a boring pick for many, but in my opinion, it is an essential one that you should hold and let it compound, as it is\u00a0a true\u00a0\u201ccash cow.\u201d\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Q1 Earnings Seasons Picks &amp; Pans: The 4 Biggest Stock Winners (and 3 Losers)",
        "content": "We\u2019re a little more than halfway through first-quarter earnings season, so now is the time to review this earnings season winners and losers. In general, market results have been encouraging so far. Forty-six percent of companies listed on the S&P 500 have reported their quarterly results. Seventy-seven percent beat forecasts with their earnings or profits, while 60% announced better-than-expected revenue or sales. That\u2019s quite good considering it comes amid reports that the economy is slowing and inflation remains stubbornly high.\n\nOf course, not every company has hit it out of the park with their Q1 results. Many companies have missed expectations or offered weak forward guidance, sending their stocks down as a result. Each day is filled with headlines of stocks that are plunging after companies disappointed analysts and investors, erasing billions from market capitalizations.\n\nSo, which companies have come out ahead and which have tanked with their Q1 financials? Let\u2019s take a look at some of this earnings season winners and losers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWinners: Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is hands down the biggest winner of the Q1 earnings season so far. GOOGL stock rose 14% immediately after the company reported blowout first-quarter earnings, declared its first dividend payment and announced a new $70 billion stock buyback program. It was a triumph among tech companies and led to the entire stock market rising. On June 17, Alphabet will pay its stockholders a cash dividend of 20 cents per share, with promises of more to come.\n\nBeyond the dividend and stock buyback, Alphabet reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.89 versus $1.51 that was expected among analysts. The Q1 profit was up 57% from a year earlier. Revenue from January through March totaled $80.54 billion compared to $78.59 billion that had been estimated. Sales in Q1 increased 15% from a year ago, the fastest rate of growth in two years. Much of the success was driven by a rebound in online advertising after two years in the doldrums.\n\nGOOGL stock has now increased 54% over the past 12 months.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant chain Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) also had a very good Q1 print, sending its stock up 6% as a result. The company\u2019s first-quarter financial results beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. Domino\u2019s reported EPS of $3.58, well ahead of the $3.40 consensus expectation of analysts. Profits were up 22% from the previous year. Revenue came in at $1.08 billion, which was slightly above Wall Street forecasts. Sales rose 6% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino\u2019s attributed the strong financial results to accelerating sales at its more than 20,000 outlets worldwide. The company is executing its \u201cHungry for More\u201d growth strategy that aims to open 1,100 new stores by 2028, increase retail sales by 7% a year and grow operating income by 8% per year. Indications are that Domino\u2019s is succeeding with its plan. Same-store sales increased 5.6% at the company\u2019s U.S. locations in Q1, beating 1% growth at its international outlets. Growth was driven largely by higher delivery orders.\n\nDomino\u2019s has also relaunched its loyalty rewards program to better engage with lower-frequency customers. The program now has 33 million active members. During Q1, Domino\u2019s opened 164 new restaurants, all but 20 of which are situated overseas. The company also repurchased $25 million worth of its own stock during the quarter.\n\nDPZ stock has gained 67% in the last 12 months.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are up 5% after the pharmaceutical company reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit and raised its forward guidance as sales of its popular weight-loss drugs takeoff. The company announced EPS of $2.58 versus $2.46 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter missed analyst targets, coming in at $8.77 billion compared to $8.92 billion that was forecast. Despite the miss, sales were up 26% YOY.\n\nLooking ahead, Eli Lilly said it now expects full-year earnings of $13.50 to $14 per share, up from previous guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 a share. The company expects full-year revenue of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion, which is an increase of $2 billion at either end of the range. Analysts had expected full-year earnings of $12.50 a share and sales of $41.44 billion. Growing sales of blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight-loss drug Zepbound are driving results at Eli Lilly.\n\nThe latest earnings included the first full quarter of Zepbound sales. The drug, which was approved by U.S. regulators last autumn, reported $517.4 million in Q1 sales. Some analysts have forecast that Zepbound could post more than $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market, and that it might become the biggest selling drug of all time.\n\nLLY stock has increased 92% in the last 12 months.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf the economy\u2019s slowing, someone forgot to tell American Express (NYSE:AXP). The credit card giant reported strong first quarter profits as its customers continue to spend on shopping, dining out and travel. Of course, American Express benefits from the fact that its clients tend to be more affluent and their spending holds up better than most during economic downturns. American Express said that its cardholder spending increased 7% from a year ago during Q1 of this year.\n\nThe credit card company reported EPS of $3.33 compared to $2.95 that was anticipated by analysts. Revenue in Q1 totaled $15.8 billion which matched Wall Street expectations. Sales were up 11% from a year earlier. Billed business, which represents the transaction value on American Express credit cards, rose 6% during the quarter to $367 billion. In terms of guidance, American Express maintained its previous revenue growth forecast of 9% to 11% and a profit estimate of $12.65 to $13.15 per share for this year.\n\nAXP stock has gained 46% in the last 12 months.\n\nLosers: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA little more than halfway through Q1 earnings season and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) looks like the big loser. META stock plunged 16% after the technology company delivered forward guidance that disappointed investors and outlined plans to continue spending heavily on new products, notably related to artificial intelligence (AI). CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s net worth dropped by $18 billion in one day after the Q1 print. Ironically, Meta\u2019s outlook overshadowed what were otherwise strong quarterly results.\n\nMeta reported EPS of $4.71, exceeding the $4.32 that was expected among analysts who track the company. Earnings more than doubled from $2.20 a share in the previous year. Revenue in the quarter totaled $36.46 billion compared to $36.16 billion expected on Wall Street. Sales were up 27% from a year earlier, representing the fastest rate of growth since 2021. Sadly, the company\u2019s guidance fell short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Growing investments in mixed reality and AI also didn\u2019t sit well with analysts and investors.\n\nMETA stock has fallen 15% since the Q1 print was delivered. However, the share price is still up nearly 84% in the last 12 months. Depending on how you look at it, META has managed to be one of the earnings season winners and losers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) can\u2019t seem to catch a break. Despite launching an aggressive growth strategy, the Golden Arches continues to report substandard quarterly results. The company just announced mixed Q1 figures, which it blamed on consumers pulling back on discretionary spending and boycotts at its restaurants in the Middle East. The Chicago-based restaurant chain reported EPS of $2.70 versus $2.72 that was expected among analysts. Revenue amounted to $6.17 billion compared to $6.16 billion that was forecast.\n\nOverall, sales at McDonald\u2019s increased 5% in Q1. Although global same-store sales rose 1.9% during the January through March period, that growth missed estimates of 2.1%. During their earnings call, management acknowledged that higher menu prices have pushed some customers away. McDonald\u2019s also noted that its restaurants in the Middle East have been hurt by the Israel-Hamas conflict and related boycotts in that region. Earlier in April, McDonald\u2019s bought the 225 restaurants operated by its Israeli franchisee.\n\nMCD stock has declined 8% over the past 12 months.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted strong Q1 results. However, NFLX stock fell 9% after its latest print was made public because it announced that it will no longer report quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per membership. Management said they are halting the reporting of subscriber numbers as they want investors to instead focus on metrics such as revenue and free cash flow. Investors took the news badly, with some claiming it\u2019s a sign that subscriber growth is slowing.\n\nControversy over the reporting of subscriber numbers overshadowed the fact that Netflix reported EPS of $5.28 compared to $4.52 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $9.37 billion versus $9.28 billion that was estimated among analysts. As for subscribers, Netflix reported a grand total of 269.6 million at the end of Q1, ahead of expectations for 264.2 million and up 16% from a year earlier. Management warned though that subscriber growth in the current second quarter will be lower than in the first due to what they called \u201cseasonality.\u201d\n\nNFLX stock has fallen 9% during April, but the share price is up 72% over the last 12 months. Like META, NFLX\u2019s numbers make it both one of the earnings season winners and losers\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in GOOGL and LLY.

        "content": "By Savyata Mishra and Juveria Tabassum\n\n(Reuters) - Global fast food giants may have to dole out steeper promotions to lure inflation-hit customers who are increasingly opting to eat at home, following weak sales from the likes of McDonald's and Starbucks this week.\n\nDisposable income in the United States is declining, particularly in the lower-income cohort, while the slow economic recovery in China has increased industry-wide pressures for quick-service chains including KFC owner Yum Brands that has extended across several quarters.\n\nMenu prices have risen across the industry over the past year as companies try to mitigate higher commodity and supply chain costs. However, that has hurt demand and boosted consumers' desire to eat at home in the United States, the world's largest economy.\n\n\"The lack of value offers has opened up consumers to shop for different options whether it be other (chains) or the grocery stores,\" Razmig Poundardjian, portfolio manager for Carnegie Investment Counsel said.\n\nPackaged food companies are also feeling the pinch of weak consumer spending, especially from low-income households, as their cookies and baked snacks see a slowdown in sales.\n\n\"Ongoing softness in U.S. biscuits is driven primarily by brands that had higher penetration among lower-income households such as Chips Ahoy!,\" Mondelez CFO Luca Zaramella said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera on Wednesday noted \"a clear pullback of restaurant spend by these lower-earning households, especially in restaurants and convenience stores.\"\n\nChina's weakness is also taking a toll. Coffee chain Starbucks expects full-year comparable sales globally to come in between flat and a low single-digit gain, lowering its previous guidance, with CEO Laxman Narasimhan saying that customers had made the trade-off \"between food away from home and food at home\".\n\nBurger giant McDonald's, which has a higher exposure to the lower-income cohort, saw global sales decline for the fourth straight quarter pushing it to lean on improving offers on its meals.\n\n\"I think it's important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer confidence index fell for the third consecutive month in April, according to a survey conducted by research group The Conference Board, which found that the first place Americans are looking to save money is on meals away from home.\n\nOver the next six months, 44.8% of those surveyed said they planned to cut back on food away from home to save money.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino's Pizza and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands on the other hand got a sales boost in the reported quarter on the back of their loyalty programs and higher promotions.\n\nSo far this year, shares of Domino's Pizza have gained 27%, while those of Restaurant Brands and McDonald's are down 6% and 8%, respectively. Shares of Starbucks have tumbled 22%.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra and Juveria Tabassum in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n\nView comments",

However, that has hurt demand and boosted consumers' desire to eat at home in the United States, the world's largest economy.\n\n\"The lack of value offers has opened up consumers to shop for different options whether it be other (chains) or the grocery stores,\" Razmig Poundardjian, portfolio manager for Carnegie Investment Counsel said.\n\nPackaged food companies are also feeling the pinch of weak consumer spending, especially from low-income households, as their cookies and baked snacks see a slowdown in sales.\n\n\"Ongoing softness in U.S. biscuits is driven primarily by brands that had higher penetration among lower-income households such as Chips Ahoy!,\" Mondelez CFO Luca Zaramella said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera on Wednesday noted \"a clear pullback of restaurant spend by these lower-earning households, especially in restaurants and convenience stores.\"\n\nChina's weakness is also taking a toll. Coffee chain Starbucks expects full-year comparable sales globally to come in between flat and a low single-digit gain, lowering its previous guidance, with CEO Laxman Narasimhan saying that customers had made the trade-off \"between food away from home and food at home\".\n\nBurger giant McDonald's, which has a higher exposure to the lower-income cohort, saw global sales growth slow for the fourth straight quarter pushing it to lean on improving offers on its meals.\n\n\"I think it's important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer confidence index fell for the third consecutive month in April, according to a survey conducted by research group The Conference Board, which found that the first place Americans are looking to save money is on meals away from home.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the next six months, 44.8% of those surveyed said they planned to cut back on food away from home to save money.\n\nDomino's Pizza and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands on the other hand got a sales boost in the reported quarter on the back of their loyalty programs and higher promotions.\n\nSo far this year, shares of Domino's Pizza have gained 27%, while those of Restaurant Brands and McDonald's are down 6% and 8%, respectively. Shares of Starbucks have tumbled 22%.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra and Juveria Tabassum in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n\nView comments",

A cook in a busy kitchen assembling cheeseburgers for orders.\n\nChris Kempczinski: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I join you today inspired from our recent worldwide convention, a time when McDonald\u2019s comes together to celebrate the success of our system. The relevance of our brand, power of our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the collective strength of our system, we are on full display as we welcomed our global McDonald\u2019s franchisees, restaurant teams, suppliers, and company employees to Barcelona. For the first time in our nearly 70-year history, we held this biannual reunion outside of North America, a testament to the global power of our brand. And we are joined by more than 15,000 attendees from nearly 100 markets to discuss how we are reimagining the future across our three-legged stool.\n\nIt is clear that McDonald\u2019s continues to operate from a position of strength across nearly all areas of the business as we focus on executing the day to day at a high level and establishing strong platforms for long-term sustained growth. The first quarter of 2024 marks our 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last four years. This success was built by establishing a strong foundation with a strategic plan basing consumer insights and focused on creating relevant marketing campaigns with our brand connected to culture. At the same time, we are maximizing the strength of our core menu equities and building an industry leading royalty base. Combined with our modernized restaurant estate, strong franchisee alignment, engage restaurant employees, and strong restaurant level unit economics, McDonald\u2019s is well positioned.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis winning formula continues to drive results and our customers visiting our restaurants today can easily see our commitment to providing them with a great experience evident through our strong customer satisfaction scores. As I reflect on the first quarter of the year it is clear that broad based consumer pressures persist around the world. Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day to day spending which is putting pressure on the QSR industry. It is worth noting the in Q1 industry traffic was flat to declining in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the UK. And across almost all major markets industry traffic is slowing. In the context of a difficult macro environment for the industry, we know our customers are looking for reliable everyday value now more than ever.\n\nSee also\n\nJim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024 and\n\nDemocrats and Corporate Insiders are Buying These 10 Stocks.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the company\u2019s performance was backed by sustained advancements in enhancing the guest experience, effective marketing strategies and traffic-driving initiatives. Following the results, the stock moved up 7.9% during trading hours on Apr 30.\n\nEarnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nIn the quarter under review, Brinker reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.24, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15.

Quote\n\nChili's\n\nDuring the fiscal third quarter, revenues in the Chili\u2019s segment rose 3.8% year over year to $999.6 million. The upside was primarily driven by increased menu pricing. However, this was partially offset by lower traffic and an unfavorable menu item mix. Our model predicted segmental revenues at $995.7 million.\r\n\r\nChili's restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal third quarter were 85.9% compared with 86.8% in the prior-year quarter. The downside was caused by sales leverage, menu pricing, favorable commodity mix, lower delivery fees and to-go supplies. A rise in advertising and hourly labor expenses partially offset this.\r\n\r\nChili's company-owned traffic declined 1.8% year over year in the quarter. The metric fell 5.8% in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe segment\u2019s company-owned comps rose 3.5% in the fiscal third quarter from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels.\r\n\r\nAt Chili\u2019s, domestic comps (including company-owned and franchised) rose 3.6% year over year compared with 9.1% growth reported in the prior-year period.\n\nMaggiano\u2019s\n\nMaggiano\u2019s sales in the fiscal third quarter increased 0.8% year over year to $120.7 million. Favorable comparable restaurant sales, courtesy of increased menu pricing and favorable menu item mix, primarily drove the upside. Comps in the segment rose 1.7% year over year. Our projection was 2.1%.\r\n\r\nTraffic in the quarter fell 7.5% year over year. The metric was up 9.5% in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nMaggiano's company restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal third quarter were 85% compared with 85.1% a year ago. The downside was caused by menu pricing partially offset by increased repairs and maintenance expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Results\n\nDuring the quarter, total operating costs and expenses came in at $1.05 billion compared with $1.02 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of company sales, was 14.2% compared with 13.4% reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nAdjusted EBITDA during the fiscal third quarter came in at $122.4 million compared with $113 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Mar 27, 2024, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $15.5 million compared with $13.8 million as of Mar 29, 2023.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 27, 2024, long-term debt was $818.5 million compared with $912.2 million as of Jun 28, 2023.

        "title": "Why Investors Need to Take Advantage of These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Now",
        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Match Group (MTCH) earns a Zacks Rank #3 six days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 7, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.41 a share.\n\nMatch Group's Earnings ESP sits at 2%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.41 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.40.\n\nMTCH is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is McDonald's (MCD).\n\nMcDonald's, which is readying to report earnings on July 25, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $3.17 a share, and MCD is 85 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nMcDonald's' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.22% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.17.\n\nMTCH and MCD's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Here's Why McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors",
        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nHow Fast Is McDonald's Growing?\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that McDonald's' EPS has grown 23% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. McDonald's maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 10.0% to US$25b. That's progress.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for McDonald's.\n\nAre McDonald's Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince McDonald's has a market capitalisation of US$197b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$415m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of McDonald's but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add McDonald's To Your Watchlist?\n\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into McDonald's' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in McDonald's' continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Even so, be aware that  McDonald's is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAlthough McDonald's certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Global Comparable Sales Growth: Nearly 2% in Q1 2024. Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS): $2.70, a 2% increase in constant currencies. Adjusted Operating Margin: Nearly 45% for the quarter. Restaurant Margin: Generated nearly $3.5 billion, up about 4% in constant currency. Adjusted Effective Tax Rate: 19.9% for the quarter. Store Development: On track to reach 50,000 restaurants by end of 2027, with significant openings in China.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MCD.\n\nRelease Date: April 30, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: What is the current outlook for McDonald's comp sales in the U.S. and IOM markets given the tougher climate? A: Ian Frederick Borden, Executive VP & Global CFO, noted that 2024 has brought significant macro headwinds, likely resulting in comp sales below the previously indicated range. U.S. comp sales are expected to start Q2 roughly flat, with industry traffic either flat or declining in major markets.\n\nQ: Is there a need for a more aggressive value approach in the U.S. to achieve the comp sales targets? A: Christopher J. Kempczinski, President & CEO, emphasized the importance of improving awareness of McDonald's value offerings in the U.S., where there is no unified national value platform, unlike competitors. The focus is on aligning the system around a strong national value proposition.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the timing and expectations for implementing the new value plan in the U.S.? A: Kempczinski mentioned learning from the quick implementation and success of a national value program in France, which significantly raised consumer awareness and positively impacted business trends. The U.S. team is working to define and implement a similar strategy.\n\nQ: What are the key drivers beyond affordability that can support U.S. sales growth in the current environment? A: Kempczinski highlighted operational excellence, including improved service times and customer satisfaction, as well as menu innovation and impactful marketing as critical drivers. These elements are crucial for engaging customers and encouraging repeat visits.\n\nQ: How does McDonald's plan to address the varying consumer perceptions of value across different income cohorts in the U.S.? A: Kempczinski pointed out that while low-income consumers are most affected, all consumer groups are seeking value due to widespread inflation. The strategy involves broadening the appeal of McDonald's value propositions to encompass all income levels, ensuring relevance and competitiveness.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: What is the approach to national value platform development, considering regional cost variations across the U.S.? A: Kempczinski explained that despite regional cost differences, a national value platform is essential for unified marketing and consumer perception. The strategy involves balancing local and national needs to optimize transaction growth and profitability.\n\nThese insights from McDonald's Q1 2024 earnings call highlight strategic adjustments in response to current economic pressures, with a significant focus on enhancing value perception and operational efficiency to drive growth and customer satisfaction.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "*\n\nAmazon set to report results after the bell\n\n*\n\nEli Lilly jumps after raising annual profit forecast\n\n*\n\nMcDonald's gains despite rare profit miss\n\n*\n\nIndexes down: Dow 0.95%, S&P 0.82%, Nasdaq 1.04%\n\n(Updates to 2:16 PM ET)\n\nBy Chibuike Oguh\n\nNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks traded lower on Tuesday as markets weighed economic data showing rising labor costs and deteriorating consumer confidence on the eve of a key Federal Reserve policy meeting to decide the direction of interest rates.\n\nData showed on Tuesday that U.S. labor costs rose by a more-than-expected 1.2% last quarter, indicating an uptick in wage pressures. A survey also found that U.S. consumer confidence worsened in April, dropping to its lowest level in more than 1-1/2 years.\n\nThe reports came a day before the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins its two-day meeting, with investors widely expecting the central bank to leave interest rates unchanged.\n\nTen out of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were trading lower, led by stocks in energy, consumer discretionary, materials, industrials and technology sectors. Equities in utilities and healthcare sectors were making gains after paring early session losses.\n\nMost Magnificent Seven stocks were also declining. Tesla down 5%, Alphabet fell 1.1%, Nvidia shed 1%, Microsoft lost 1.6%, and Amazon dropped 0.6%.\n\n\"We're still in an environment where the knee-jerk reaction is to extrapolate any warmer data into firmer inflation and more hawkish reaction from the Fed,\" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston.\n\n\"But nothing has changed: growth is still strong, labor markets are holding up, and ultimately we're taking a little bit of breather in the disinflation process,\" Melson added.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in just about 31 basis points (bps) of rate cuts this year, down from about 150 bps estimated at the start of 2024, according to LSEG data.\n\nAt 02:16 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 365.34 points, or 0.95%, to 38,020.75, the S&P 500 lost 41.94 points, or 0.82%, to 5,074.23 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 165.79 points, or 1.04%, to 15,817.29.\n\nShares of GE HealthCare shrank 13.3% after its first-quarter revenue missed analyst estimates, 3M gained 3.3% after posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit.\n\nDrugmaker Eli Lilly jumped 6% after it raised its full-year profit forecast. PayPal rose 2% after raising its full-year adjusted profit forecast.\n\nMcDonald's rebounded from early losses and was up 0.1% after it missed quarterly profit estimates for the first time in two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the 265 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings to date for the first quarter, 79.2% have beat analyst estimates, compared with the long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.76-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 1,225 stocks rose and 2,880 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.35-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 45 new highs and 99 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; additional reporting by Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n\nView comments",

It came despite its property arm, which includes chunks of wealthy London neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Belgravia, swinging to a \u00a328.6m loss in 2023 from a profit of \u00a3110.4m the year before.\n\nThe value of Grosvenor\u2019s property portfolio has fallen \u00a3300m to \u00a38.6bn. Mark Preston, the chief executive, argued that this was mild compared to rival landlords, as he blamed the fall on higher interest rates and a dip in investor confidence \u201crather than any specific behavioural change in working habits\u201d.\n\nHe said Grosvenor has benefited from \u201clarge corporates which have perhaps taken significant areas of space in areas like Canary Wharf downsizing due to hybrid work patterns\u201d and wanting to choose an area that\u2019s \u201cvibrant and interesting\u201d with theatres, parks and shops.\n\nHe added that \u201cshowroom-type retail\u201d, where the cash tills are not necessarily ringing but high-end items which consumers might buy online later are displayed, have also proved resilient as shoppers flock to upmarket areas rather than giant shopping malls.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n04:54 PM BST\n\nFootsie closes down\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed down 0.04pc.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best fast food stocks to buy according to analysts. To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Fast Food Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe fast food industry is synonymous with quick service, affordability, and continuous menu innovation, meeting consumers' desires on multiple fronts. This global phenomenon shows no signs of slowing down, thanks to the ability of fast food chains to appeal to a vast consumer base, with these chains having expanded their reach worldwide and established enduring presences in international markets. Looking at the U.S. specifically, a\u00a0study conducted by The Barbecue Lab revealed that the majority of Americans indulge in fast food one to three times per week, with over 83% of US families consuming it at least once a week. The study suggests that many perceive fast food as being \"relatively inexpensive compared to other dining options,\" with more than 32% of fast food consumers considering it cheaper than alternatives. However, despite this perception, the actual cost of fast food tends to be higher compared to home-cooked meals. Surprisingly, it is individuals with higher incomes who tend to consume more fast food than those with lower incomes, contrary to the common belief that lower-income families rely on fast food for its affordability.\n\nAmong the most renowned fast food chains with global reach are McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), and The Wendy\u2019s Company (NASDAQ:WEN). Over the years, these companies, along with others in the industry, have cultivated strong brand loyalty and become household names for those seeking convenient takeout options. In such a dynamic landscape, established brands maintain their dominance despite the influx of new concepts, leveraging advancements in technologies like AI. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), for instance, acquired Dynamic Yield in 2019, a tech company specializing in personalization and decision logic. This acquisition enabled McDonald's to enhance the drive-thru experience by offering dynamically changing menus based on factors such as weather, current restaurant traffic, and trending menu items. Similarly, Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) introduced an AI-powered pizza checker named DOM, leveraging machine learning to ensure the quality of each pizza before delivery. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also embraced technology with its Deep Brew program, automating inventory management and predicting ingredient quantities to minimize waste and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting in the fast-food industry presents an intriguing opportunity, with reasonable valuations and promising growth prospects. However, not all companies in this sector are poised to outperform the market. Those capable of expanding their market share deserve premium valuations. In our previous coverage of the best fast food stocks back in March of 2023, companies like McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) reigned supreme, with McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) securing the top spot in the QSR 50 Report for 2022, affirming its position as the leading QSR company thanks to the company's outstanding performance in 2021, both in terms of system-wide sales surpassing $112 billion and digital sales crossing the $18 billion mark. The company continued its performance the following year, with the QSR 50 Report for 2023 revealing that the company's systemwide sales had grown by nearly $20 billion at the beginning of the year.\n\nThat said, how different are things from back then? For one, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) experienced a setback after mixed quarterly earnings in Q4 2023, leading some consumers to opt out of fast food. The company reported quarterly net revenues of $6.4 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $6.5 billion. Despite this, sales at company-operated restaurants increased by 12% year over year to $2.5 billion. Chris Kempczinski, the president and CEO of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), credited the company's performance to the execution of the Accelerating the Arches strategy, the initiative which facilitated cumulative comparable sales growth of over 30% since 2019. Meanwhile, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) aims to rebound from two lackluster years that saw its shares decline by over 3%.\n\nIn terms of growth, a research report by Precedence Research states that the global fast food industry reached an estimated value of $702.8 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $964.6 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.0% from 2022 to 2030. The continuous evolution of the fast food market is driven by increasing demand for on-the-go snacks, convenience foods, and ready meals, influenced by the busy lifestyle of millennials and the growing population of working individuals worldwide. Furthermore, the expanding availability of delivery options and services also contributes to this growth. 11 Best Fast Food Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nJonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best fast food stocks to buy according to analysts, we used a stock screener to list down a number of fast food stocks, ranking the firms by their average analyst share price target upside.\n\nFor these best fast food stocks to buy according to analysts, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11. Shake Shack Inc.

(NYSE:SHAK) ranks as one of the best fast food stocks to buy.\n\n10. The Wendy\u2019s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 10.38%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $20.53\n\nThe Wendy\u2019s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is a quick-service restaurant chain with operations both in the United States and internationally.

Wendy\u2019s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent. The business is insulated from food and labor inflation since 95% of the restaurant base is owned and operated by franchisees. Wendy\u2019s topline has proven remarkably resilient through diverse economic climates, producing 12 straight years of positive same-restaurant sales. The company is well-positioned for accelerating topline growth due to its recent launch of a breakfast menu, steady market share gains, international expansion and new restaurant openings. Despite these favorable characteristics, we had an opportunity to purchase shares at ~17x free cash flow, representing a discount to its quick-service restaurant peers as well as private market transactions.\u201d\n\n9.

We believe the company can outperform these targets, as expenses will grow slower than sales while it laps its investments at Burger King in the U.S. The company also updated investors on franchisee profitability with significant improvements at each of its brands, including nearly 50% increases in franchise profitability at Burger King in the U.S. and 30% at Tim Hortons in Canada\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nRestaurant Brands International Inc.

        "content": "McDonald's Corporation MCD posted first-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same. The top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nChris Kempczinski, president and CEO of McDonald's, said that as consumers increasingly scrutinize every dollar they spend, the company\u2019s commitment is to consistently earn their patronage by providing top-notch dependable value and exceptional service.

Comparable sales saw a boost due to increased average checks resulting from strategic menu price adjustments.

Our model estimated U.S. comps to climb 3.9%.\r\n\r\nInternational Operated Markets: Segmental comps increased 2.7% compared with 12.6% in the year-ago quarter. Strong comparable sales in Germany and the U.K. resulted in the uptick.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- McDonald\u2019s Corp. results fell short of expectations in the first quarter, hampered by slowing growth in the US and the reverberations of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Tesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System Stocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day. Increasingly, Only 10 Matter Binance and CZ\u2019s Fortunes Are Set to Grow, Jail or no Jail US Warns ICC Action on Israel Would Hurt Cease-Fire Chances\n\nGrowth in comparable sales, a metric tracking restaurants open for over a year, was 1.9% \u2014 slower than analysts polled by Bloomberg anticipated. Each of McDonald\u2019s geographic segments fell short of expectations on sales by that metric, including a slight miss in the key US market. The business unit that includes the Middle East recorded a decline.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has taken a hit from boycotts related to the war in the Middle East, warning on Tuesday of revenue weakness \u201cas long as the war continues.\u201d Executives have also said that low-income consumers in the US, an important part of the company\u2019s customer base, are pulling back.\n\nThe chain plans to focus on affordability in the US, with executives hinting at a nationwide value menu in a call with investors. Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski touted the success of offers like the McSmart, a bundle available in countries including Germany.\n\nIn its home market, McDonald\u2019s already offers deals through its app and through offers franchisees have come up with, but that approach is \u201cvery fragmented,\u201d Kempczinski said.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s shares fell as much as 4% to $262.63 in New York, the lowest intraday price since Nov. 1. The shares had declined 7.7% this year through Monday\u2019s close, while the S&P 500 Index was up 7.3%.\n\nSome analysts had trimmed their outlook for comparable sales before McDonald\u2019s released results, in part on data pointing to moderating traffic. After outpacing the rest of the industry in recent years, the burger chain is facing weakened demand across the world as it embarks on an ambitious expansion strategy.\n\nWhile comparable-sales growth is slowing, the company pointed to a 3% expansion in systemwide sales in the quarter. That gauge also includes new restaurants, which are key to the company\u2019s targets.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is hoping items such as the limited-time Bacon Cajun Ranch McCrispy will bring in diners. It\u2019s also looking to attract customers into its loyalty program and with bundles for under $4 at many US locations.\n\nStill, traffic might not improve in a sustained way in the first half of the year, BTIG LLC analyst Peter Saleh said in a note before the earnings release. He sees discounts, which can erode profitability, likely remaining prevalent.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings, excluding some items, were $2.70 a share in the first quarter. Analysts polled by Bloomberg were expecting $2.72.\n\n(Adds executive commentary throughout.

        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) reported $6.17 billion in revenue for the quarter ended March 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. EPS of $2.70 for the same period compares to $2.63 a year ago.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.01% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.71, the EPS surprise was -0.37%.\n\nWhile investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.\n\nSince these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.\n\nHere is how McDonald's performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nComparable sales growth - U.S. - YoY change: 2.5% compared to the 2.7% average estimate based on 10 analysts.

        "content": "McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Posts Q1 Sales In Line With Estimates\n\nFast-food chain McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) reported results in line with analysts' expectations in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 4.6% year on year to $6.17 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $2.70 per share, improving from its profit of $2.63 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy McDonald's? Find out in our full research report.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $6.17 billion vs analyst estimates of $6.17 billion (small beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $2.70 vs analyst expectations of $2.73 (small miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 55.7%, in line with the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales were up 2% year on year Market Capitalization: $197.5 billion\n\n\"Our global comparable sales growth in the first quarter marks 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last 4 years,\" said CEO Chris Kempczinski.\n\nArguably one of the most iconic brands in the world, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food behemoth known for its convenience, value, and wide assortment of menu items.\n\nTraditional Fast Food\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nSales Growth\n\nMcDonald's is one of the most widely recognized restaurant chains in the world and benefits from brand equity, giving it customer loyalty and more influence over purchasing decisions.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 4.3% over the last five years was weak, but to its credit, it opened new restaurants and grew sales at existing, established dining locations. McDonald's Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, McDonald's grew its revenue by 4.6% year on year, and its $6.17 billion in revenue was in line with Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 5.6% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nStory continues\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nA company's same-store sales growth shows the year-on-year change in sales for its restaurants that have been open for at least a year, give or take. This is a key performance indicator because it measures organic growth and demand.\n\nMcDonald's demand has outpaced the broader restaurant sector over the last eight quarters. On average, the company has grown its same-store sales by a robust 8.8% year on year. With positive same-store sales growth amid an increasing number of restaurants, McDonald's is reaching more diners and growing sales. McDonald's Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, McDonald's same-store sales rose 2% year on year. By the company's standards, this growth was a meaningful deceleration from the 12.6% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago. We'll be watching McDonald's closely to see if it can reaccelerate growth.\n\nKey Takeaways from McDonald's Q1 Results\n\nThis quarter was a par for McDonald's. Its revenue, same-store sales growth, and EPS were in line with analysts' expectations, showing the business is holding steady. Double-clicking into its three regions, we can see that same-store sales increased 2.5% and 2.7% in the U.S. and its International Operated Markets but shrank 0.2% in its International Developmental Licensed Markets. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter. The stock is flat after reporting and currently trades at $271.18 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in McDonald's right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Adds shares in paragraph 2)\n\nApril 30 (Reuters) - McDonald's fell short of Wall Street estimates for first-quarter sales on Tuesday as budget-conscious consumers cut back on restaurant meals and the Middle East conflict weighed on the burger chain's international sales.\n\nThe company's shares fell about 2% in premarket trading, after slipping nearly 8% so far this year.\n\nGlobal comparable sales growth slid for the fourth straight quarter to 1.9%, with the company saying consumers turned \"more discriminating with every dollar they spend\". Analysts had estimated a 2.35% rise, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company has raised prices by roughly mid- to high-single-digit percentage over the past year in response to a rise in costs of eggs and other raw items.\n\nComparable sales in the company's International Developmental Licensed Markets segment, which made up 10% of its overall revenue in 2023, declined 0.2%, offsetting positive trends from Japan, Latin America and Europe. Analysts had expected a 0.98% rise for the unit.\n\nEarlier in March, McDonald's CFO Ian Borden had warned of a sequential fall in international sales in the first quarter, pressured by the conflict in the Middle East and a sluggish Chinese economy, its second-largest market after the United States.\n\nHigher competition for breakfast hour spending in the United States has prompted the burger giant to lean on low-priced menu choices including breakfast value bundles and a Dollar Menu under the $4 price point.\n\nFirst-quarter same-store sales grew 2.5% in the United States, sharply lower than a 12.6% growth last year and slightly below estimates of a 2.55% growth, signaling that cash-strapped Americans remained picky about offers at fast-food chains amid still-high inflation.\n\nMcDonald's posted quarterly adjusted per-share profit of $2.70. Analysts had estimated $2.72, according to LSEG data. Total operating costs and expenses increased 2% to $3.43 billion.

        "content": "McDonald's customers may be thinking twice before grabbing a Big Mac and fries.\n\nThe chain posted Q1 results that missed revenue growth and same-store sales estimates across its segments, while its earnings also came below expectations.\n\n\"As consumers are more discriminating with every dollar that they spend, we will continue to earn their visits,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a release.\n\nThe fast food giant posted revenue of $6.17 billion, up 4% year over year and slightly higher than Wall Street estimates of $6.15 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is up 2% to $2.70, below expectations of $2.72.\n\nGlobal same-store sales growth was 1.9% year over year, compared to the 2.33% jump that Wall Street was hoping for. That's also far lower than the 12.6% increase seen in 2023 Q1.\n\nUS same store sales were up 2.5%, slightly off from the 2.55% expected. Higher menu prices boosted the average check size, while marketing campaigns and growth in digital and delivery helped bolster sales.\n\nIn international markets where McDonald's operates its own stores, same store sales were up 2.7%, compared to the 12.6% growth seen a year ago.\n\nSelect international markets where McDonald's operate via franchisees, like Europe, Latin America, and Asia, saw positive sales growth. But overall same store sales for the segment fell 0.2%, due to \"the continued impact of the war in the Middle East.\"\n\nIn early January, CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald\u2019s.\"\n\nThe company's loyalty program played a key role in its performance. As consumers look for value and deals, loyalty members brought in $6 billion in digital sales across 50 markets during Q1, and $25 billion for the past 12 months.\n\nShares of the fast food giant have been under pressure, dropping 8% year to date compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 8.5% gain.\n\nPrior to the release, Deutsche Bank research analyst Lauren Silberman said sentiment on the company \"appears to lean negative ... reflecting concerns on International same-store sales and risk to numbers\" in a client note.\n\nWhile there are near-term issues, Silberman wrote that \"concerns on McDonald's global strength and value leadership are overblown\" and that she continues \"to see the brand as well positioned for outperformance over time, particularly in a more challenging consumer backdrop.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis comes as the competition is heating up, with Wendy's (WEN), Burger King (QSR), and Taco Bell (YUM) vying for market share with promotional activity.\n\nCiti analyst Jon Tower identified the bull and bear case for the Golden Arches in a recent note.\n\nFor the bull case, he said the company has a \"precedent for ... leaning into value to drive step function gains in share in softer macro backdrops, and digital relationships offer a new avenue for pursuing these goals.\"\n\nAs for the bear case, McDonald's value isn't what it once was.\n\n\"Wage increases and the associated price have fundamentally broken the consumer\u2019s value-relationship with quick service restaurants, convenience stores offer an increasingly competitive alternative at lower price points, and California wage increases are an additional wrench in getting franchisees broadly on board with a national value offer,\" Tower wrote.\n\nExperts told Yahoo Finance the sheer scale of McDonald's and other large chains can help insulate them from recent legislation in California that raised the minimum wage for most fast food establishments to $20. However, as menu prices rise, the companies may have to compete more aggressively on discounts and promotions. A McDonald's store is seen in Yichang, Hubei province, China, April 18, 2024.

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s said higher U.S. sales in the first quarter helped it overcome weakness in the Middle East and other markets where consumers have been boycotting the brand.\n\nThe Chicago burger giant said its same-store sales \u2013 or sales at stores open at least a year -- rose 1.9% worldwide in the January-March period. That was below Wall Street\u2019s forecast of a 2.1% increase, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nIn the U.S., same-store sales rose 2.5% as the company raised prices and saw higher demand for delivery. But sales fell 0.2% in McDonald\u2019s international franchised markets. It was the first time since 2020 that same-store sales have fallen in that segment.\n\nCustomers across the Middle East and in Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia have been boycotting McDonald\u2019s for months over its perceived support for Israel. The boycotts began in October, after McDonald\u2019s local Israeli franchisee announced it was providing free meals for Israeli troops involved in the war in Gaza.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has tried to limit the fallout. In early April, the company said it was buying Alyonal Limited, its Israeli franchisee, and taking over the country's 225 restaurants. Financial terms of the deal weren't released.\n\nMcDonald's said its revenue rose 5% to $6.17 billion in the January-March period. That was in line with Wall Street's estimates.\n\nNet income was up 7% to $1.93 billion. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring charges, were $2.70 per share. That was short of analysts' forecast of $2.72.\n\nMcDonald's shares were down 1.5% in premarket trading Tuesday.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Global comparable sales have grown nearly 2% for the quarter, marking 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth\n\nConsolidated revenues for the quarter were more than $6 billion, an increase over prior year of over 4% in constant currencies\n\nSystemwide sales* to loyalty members across 50 loyalty markets were nearly $25 billion for the trailing twelve-month period and over $6 billion for the quarter\n\nCHICAGO, April 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- McDonald's Corporation today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\"Our global comparable sales growth in the first quarter marks 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last 4 years,\" said CEO Chris Kempczinski. \"As consumers are more discriminating with every dollar that they spend, we will continue to earn their visits by delivering leading, reliable, everyday value and outstanding execution in our restaurants. As we look to the rest of 2024 and beyond, we remain focused on leveraging the competitive advantages within our Accelerating the Arches plan and growing QSR market share to drive long-term growth.\"\n\nFirst quarter financial performance:\n\nGlobal comparable sales increased 1.9%, reflecting positive comparable sales in the U.S. and International Operated Markets segment. Comparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed Markets segment were slightly negative as the segment continued to be impacted by the war in the Middle East:\n\nU.S. increased 2.5%\n\nInternational Operated Markets segment increased 2.7%\n\nInternational Developmental Licensed Markets segment decreased 0.2%  Consolidated revenues increased 5% (4% in constant currencies).  Systemwide sales increased 3% (3% in constant currencies).\n\nConsolidated operating income increased 8% (8% in constant currencies). Results reflected pre-tax charges of $35 million and $180 million for the current year and prior year, respectively, primarily related to restructuring charges associated with Accelerating the Organization. Excluding these current and prior year charges, consolidated operating income increased 2% (2% in constant currencies).**\n\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.66, an increase of 9% (9% in constant currencies). Excluding the current year charges described above of $0.04 per share, diluted earnings per share was $2.70, an increase of 2% (2% in constant currencies) when also excluding prior year charges.**\n\n*Refer to page 3 for a definition of Systemwide sales. **Refer to page 2 for additional details on charges for the first quarter 2024 and 2023.\n\n1\n\nStory continues\n\nCOMPARABLE SALES Increase/(Decrease) Quarters Ended March 31, 2024 2023 U.S. 2.5\u00a0% 12.6\u00a0% International Operated Markets 2.7 12.6 International Developmental Licensed Markets (0.2) 12.6 Total  1.9\u00a0% 12.6\u00a0%\n\nU.S.: Comparable sales results benefited from average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases. Successful restaurant level execution, effective marketing campaigns featuring the core menu and continued digital and delivery growth contributed to positive comparable sales results.  International Operated Markets: Segment performance was driven by positive comparable sales in most markets, led by the U.K. and Germany, partly offset by negative comparable sales in France.  International Developmental Licensed Markets: The continued impact of the war in the Middle East more than offset positive comparable sales in Japan, Latin America and Europe.\n\nKEY FINANCIAL METRICS - CONSOLIDATED\n\nDollars in millions, except per share data Quarters Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Inc/ (Dec) Inc/ (Dec)\n\nExcluding\n\nCurrency\n\nTranslation Revenues $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06,169 $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05,898 5 % 4 % Operating income 2,736 2,532 8 8 Net income 1,929 1,802 7 7 Earnings per share-diluted $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.66 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.45 9 % 9 %\n\nResults included pre-tax charges of $35 million, or $0.04 per share, for the three months ended 2024 and $180 million, or $0.18 per share, for the three months ended 2023, primarily related to restructuring charges associated with the Company's internal effort to modernize ways of working (Accelerating the Organization).\n\nExcluding the above items, results reflected positive operating performance driven primarily by higher sales-driven Franchised margins, partly offset by higher Selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE-DILUTED RECONCILIATION\n\nDollars in millions, except per share data Quarters Ended March 31, Net Income Earnings per share - diluted 2024 2023 Inc/ (Dec) Inc/ (Dec)\n\nExcluding\n\nCurrency\n\nTranslation 2024 2023 Inc/ (Dec) Inc/ (Dec)\n\nExcluding\n\nCurrency\n\nTranslation GAAP $\u00a0\u00a0 1,929 $\u00a0\u00a0 1,802 7 % 7 % $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.66 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.45 9 % 9 % (Gains)/charges 27 134 0.04 0.18 Non-GAAP $\u00a0\u00a0 1,957 $\u00a0\u00a0 1,936 1 % 1 % $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.70 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.63 2 % 2 %\n\n2\n\nTHE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASE\n\nConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees. Systemwide sales to loyalty members is comprised of all sales to customers who self-identify as a loyalty member when transacting with both Company-owned and operated and franchised restaurants. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are measured across approximately 50 markets with loyalty programs. Systemwide sales to loyalty members represents an aggregation of the prior four quarters of sales to loyalty members active in the last 90 days. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n\nFree cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.\n\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information related to the Company's results for the quarter ended March\u00a031, 2024.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation will broadcast its investor earnings conference call live over the Internet at 7:30 a.m. (Central Time) on April\u00a030, 2024.

        "content": "A lot is stacked against McDonald's this quarter.\n\nWage inflation, tighter wallets, and global conflict are creating headwinds for the Golden Arches. Wall Street is expecting weaker foot traffic for the chain, which may take a toll on McDonald's (MCD) Q1 report.\n\nThe fast food giant is set to report its Q1 earnings before market open on Tuesday. Expectations are muted, as the Street fears that consumers may be pulling back on their Big Mac or McNuggets in light of persistent inflation.\n\nMcDonald's revenue is expected to grow 4.4% year over year to $6.14 billion, while adjusted earnings per share is expected to come in 3.4% higher at $2.72.\n\nGlobal same-store sales growth is expected to see a 2.33% jump, down from the 3.4% growth seen in Q4 2023.\n\nIn early January, CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald\u2019s.\"\n\nIn the US, same store sales is expected to grow 2.55% year over year, also lower than Q4's 4.3% jump.\n\nStock of the fast food giant has been under pressure, dropping 8% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 8.5% gain.\n\nBTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a note to clients that foot traffic growth is expected to trend down, adding that the \"average check will remain under pressure from the heavy discounting to recover lower-income consumer traffic.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank research analyst Lauren Silberman said sentiment on the company \"appears to lean negative... reflecting concerns on International same-store sales and risk to numbers,\" in a client note.\n\nWhile there are near term issues, Silberman wrote that \"concerns on McDonald's global strength and value leadership are overblown. She \"continue to see the brand as well positioned for outperformance over time, particularly in a more challenging consumer backdrop.\"\n\nThis comes as the competition is heating up, with Wendy's (WEN), Burger King (QSR), and Taco Bell (YUM) vying for market share with promotional activity.\n\nCiti analyst Jon Tower identified the bull and bear case for Golden Arches in a recent note.\n\nFor the bull case, he said it has a \"precedent for...leaning into value to drive step function gains in share in softer macro backdrops, and digital relationships offer a new avenue for pursuing these goals.\"\n\nAs for the bear case, McDonald's value isn't what it once was.\n\n\"Wage increases and the associated price have fundamentally broken the consumer\u2019s value-relationship with quick service restaurants, convenience stores offer an increasingly competitive alternative at lower price points, and California wage increases are an additional wrench in getting franchisees broadly on board with a national value offer,\" Tower wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperts told Yahoo Finance the sheer scale of McDonald's and other large chains can help insulate them from California's FAST act, which raised fast food minimum wage to $20. However, as menu prices rise, the companies may have to compete more aggressively on discounts and promotions.

        "title": "McDonald's set for weak sales growth as US fast-food chains grapple with muted traffic",
        "content": "(Reuters) - McDonald's is set to report a sequential drop in sales growth for the fourth straight quarter as low-income consumers remain hesitant about eating out even as fast-food chains battle to lure them with value menu items.\n\nThe burger giant will report first-quarter results on Tuesday, kicking off earnings for U.S. restaurant chains, with top players such as Starbucks and KFC-parent Yum Brands set to report results later in the week.\n\n\"We expect traffic to continue to be negative and believe the average check will remain under pressure from the heavy discounting to recover lower-income consumer traffic,\" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said.\n\nMcDonald's has leaned on its Dollar Menu, offering items in the $1, $2, $3 price points to lure in diners on a budget, while Wendy's this month offered some items for just a dollar on orders placed via apps. Taco Bell also launched a new Cravings Value Menu for some burritos and tacos at $3 or less in January.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTHE CONTEXT\n\nAfter a slow start to the year at McDonald's owing to inclement weather in January and choppy spending due to still-high inflation, Wall Street analysts believe discounting could be a theme for the rest of the year at the food joints.\n\nVisits to McDonald's rose 2.4% in the January to March period, Taco Bell saw a 3.8% jump and Chipotle a 10% increase, data from Placer.ai showed.\n\nMcDonald's is also expected to continue to see sales drag from its International Developmental Licensed Markets segment, which has been hurt by the Israel-Hamas conflict and weak demand in China.\n\nAt least five brokerages have trimmed their price target on the company's stock so far in April.\n\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS\n\n** McDonald's is expected to show a 2.36% rise in global same-store sales when it reports first-quarter results on Tuesday, while earnings per share (EPS) is expected to come in at $2.72.\n\n** A day later, Yum Brands is expected to post a 0.34% increase in worldwide same-store sales for the first quarter, compared with a rise of 1% in the fourth quarter and up 8% last year. First-quarter EPS is expected to rise to $1.20.\n\nStory continues\n\nWALL STREET SENTIMENT\n\n** McDonald's shares have lost nearly 8% year-to-date, roughly similar to Starbucks, while Chipotle has surged about 40%. Yum Brands and Wendy's are up about 8.5% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\n** The S&P 500 Restaurants index is up 0.88% in the same period, underperforming a nearly 7% jump in the benchmark S&P 500.\n\n** McDonald's has an average rating of \"buy\", with 38 analysts covering the stock, their median price target is $325, according to LSEG data.\n\n** Yum Brands has a current average rating of \"hold\", with 29 analysts covering the stock, and a median price target of $145.04.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

These investments not only provide a steady stream of income but also offer a cushion against market fluctuations.\n\nWith surging volatility levels, stability is a coveted asset, making established companies with solid track records particularly enticing. These industry stalwarts boast impressive track records of dividend payments coupled with resilient business models, making them attractive options for those looking to strengthen their portfolios.\n\nFortis\n\nWith roughly $66 billion in total assets, Fortis Inc. (NYSE:FTS) is one of North America\u2019s most prominent regulated gas and electric utility companies. Headquartered in St John\u2019s, Canada, Fortis joined the ranks of \u201cDividend King\u201d companies in September last year, when it raised its dividend payouts for the 50th consecutive year.\n\nThe electric utility giant hiked its quarterly dividends by 4.4% to $0.59 per share, payable from the fourth quarter of 2023. Fortis currently pays $1.70 in dividends annually, yielding 4.36% on its current price. Furthermore, the company forecasts its dividends to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4-6% over the next four years. Thus, Fortis stands tall as a reliable income generator, making it a compelling dividend stock for income-focused investors.\n\n\u201cOur Board of Directors declared a fourth-quarter dividend representing a 4.4% increase that will mark 50 years of consecutive increases in dividends paid,\u201d said David Hutchens, President and CEO of Fortis, \u201cOur sustainable regulated growth strategy is focused on delivering cleaner energy that remains affordable and reliable for our customers while supporting annual dividend growth of 4-6% through 2028.\u201d\n\nFortis\u2019 next dividend payment will be on June 1, 2024, with an ex-dividend date of May 16, 2024.\n\nAltria\n\nAltria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), a tobacco industry titan, continues to allure investors with an annual dividend payout of $3.92 per share, translating to a 9.04% dividend yield.\n\nAnother Dividend King stock, Altria Group, has raised its dividends consistently 58 times over the last 54 years. The latest dividend hike came in the third quarter of 2023, with Altria raising its quarterly payouts by 4.3% to $0.94 per share.\n\nDespite facing regulatory headwinds, Altria\u2019s resilient business model and enduring cash flows make it a dividend powerhouse. \u201cWe made meaningful progress in pursuit of our Vision, and our highly profitable traditional tobacco businesses continued to perform well in a challenging environment,\u201d said Billy Gifford, Altria\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, in the latest earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltria also increased its share repurchase program by $2.4 billion, as stated in its first-quarter earnings release, which should further bolster shareholder returns.\n\nAltira\u2019s next dividend will be paid to shareholders on April 30, 2024.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), the global fast-food behemoth, not only satisfies appetites but also tantalizes investors with its enticing dividend prospects.

The company has raised its dividends consistently for 47 years since it began disbursing payouts in 1976.

        "title": "The Need to Feed: 3 Fast Food Stocks With the Strongest Upside Potential in 2024",
        "content": "A wide range of markets in the United States are experiencing a period of uncertainty in the wake of stubborn inflation rates reflected in the hotter-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) data reported for March. However, the fast food industry has continued to show its resilience.\u00a0This is why fast food stocksare such a great buy.\n\nAfter all, we\u2019re talking about an industry that\u2019s expected to grow to $1.467 trillion in market size by 2028. It will even do it at a CAGR of 6.05%. It\u2019s also worth acknowledging that fast food stocks have dealt with periods of extreme uncertainty before and come out thriving.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw the emergence of social distancing measures. These challenged much of the fast food industry\u2019s traditional revenue streams. However, restaurants tackled the loss of diners by undergoing a widespread series of digital transformation initiatives, These excelled in providing takeaway services to consumers in lockdown.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuring the pandemic, data showed that the number of consumers who ordered fast food for delivery lept 28% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Drive-thru services accounted for 44% of all off-premise orders throughout the restaurant industry.\n\nThese figures are important for investors because they illustrate the adaptability of fast food stocks to continue securing growth in testing times. As markets react to the prospect of fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024, it\u2019s more likely that fast food stocks will once again show their adaptability in challenging circumstances. With this in mind, the following stocks could be a strong option to buy and hold in 2024:\n\nTop Fast Food Stocks: McDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nNo list of growth-focused fast food stocks would be complete without McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). We\u2019re talking about a global market leader, boasting 38,000 restaurants throughout 100 countries.\n\nIf any stock is well positioned to brush off US market volatility, it\u2019s globally focused firms like McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe stock\u2019s impressive rate of growth should also be a source of comfort for investors. MCD reached an all-time high value in early 2024 before undergoing a market correction of around 8% off the back of missed revenue estimates amid an escalation of geopolitical conflict in the Middle East.\n\nDespite this, McDonald\u2019s long-term prospects are strong. The stock has rallied almost 40% in the past five years. This is an impressive feat considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2022\u2019s Wall Street downturn on growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm\u2019s positive Q1 2024 revenue estimates, which predict a year-over-year earnings increase of 2.7% to $2.70 per share and a 4.7% increase in revenues to $6.17 billion, also illustrate McDonald\u2019s resilience at a time of global economic turbulence.\n\nCrucially, we can also see that the brand is continuing to facilitate growth through a series of strategic partnerships. These partnerships are designed to facilitate more sales growth. There was a recent announcement of a partnership between McDonald\u2019s and Krispy Kreme. This is set to see the latter\u2019s donuts launch in McDonald\u2019s restaurants by 2026. The partnership is a key statement of intent for a firm focused on strengthening its position as a market leader.\n\nWendy\u2019s (WEN) A photo of a Wendy's chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.\n\nSource: Deutschlandreform / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite posting a decline of almost 15% in 2023, Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) has been one of the fast food market\u2019s brighter performers in the first half of 2024.\n\nWendy\u2019s doesn\u2019t quite boast the global market presence of McDonald\u2019s. However this dividend stock has been identified as a strong passive income option for investors. It appears set to recover from a series of disappointments that have impacted its value in recent months.\n\nWendy\u2019s missed its Q4 2023 estimates by posting earnings of 21 cents per share. This was below Wall Street projections of 23 cents. However, the February 2024 arrival of Kirk Tanner appears to be a watershed moment for the stock. Wendy\u2019s has since recovered by more than 10% from its Q1 lows.\n\nGiven the challenges and franchise closures Wendy\u2019s faced in 2023, the stock could be an excellent value proposition for investors seeking to buy into the restaurant\u2019s long-term recovery.\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR) a tray of food from popeyes\n\nSource: Tony Prato / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn terms of profitability, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) stands as one of the strongest recent performers in this selection.\n\nThe stock\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings report showed a surge in profits to $508 million. Net sales climbed 8% to $1.82 billion from $1.68 billion in the previous year.\n\nRestaurant Brands International is the parent company of Burger King, Popeyes, Tim Hortons, Firehouse Subs, and The TDL Group Corp. This impressive repertoire of varied restaurants and fast food services offers an element of diversified security within the sector.\n\nGiven these exceptional revenue streams, the debts are consistently covered by earnings for QSR. Its earnings growth has comfortably exceeded the industry average over the past year.\n\nWhile QSR is also a dividend stock, it\u2019s not considered one of Wall Street\u2019s strongest dividend payers. Fortunately, the outlook for the stock as a whole is rosy enough to overcome this weakness, with estimates suggesting that Restaurant Brands International is set to grow its profit by 59% over the next couple of years.\n\nAs wider inflation-driven uncertainty continues to loom over US markets, the security offered by QSR\u2019s strong restaurant repertoire could be an attractive way to safeguard better against volatility.\n\nGiven that the stock has already bounced back by more than 125% from its pandemic lows, and has been pushing new all-time high values as recently as March, there\u2019s plenty for investors to be excited about with Restaurant Brands International.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Dividend stocks can be a great way to build wealth. If you are a long-term investor and believe in dividend reinvesting, you could generate above-average returns over a few years. However, the trick is to choose companies that have a steady cash flow and those that believe in rewarding shareholders, no matter how the market moves. If a stock market crash is predicted for the near future, invest in these seven dividend stocks for steady returns, you will continue to generate income while you wait for the market to improve.\n\nThese companies have steady earnings growth and enough liquidity to keep paying dividends. Whether you are investing for your retirement, to leave a legacy, or to cover your monthly expenses, these dividend stocks will ensure you enjoy a considerable amount of cash each year. With that in mind, let\u2019s\u00a0take a\u00a0look at the dividend stocks for steady returns. All of these companies enjoy a yield higher than 2%.\n\nDividend Stocks For Steady Returns: 3M (MMM)\n\nDividend yield-6.61%\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) is ready for a comeback after the healthcare spinoff. The management has made several decisions to ensure that the finances are in place and has\u00a0managed to see\u00a0an improvement in the free cash flow. The company reported a revenue of $8 billion for the fourth quarter and an operating cash flow of $2 billion. It is set to report first-quarter results on April 30.\n\n3M is making significant investments in the\u00a0hydrogen industry to enhance the manufacturing of its electrolyzers and this move could help with future growth. MMM stock is trading for $91 today and it enjoys a dividend yield of 6.61%. It is hard to find a company with a dividend yield as high as 6% in the current market environment.\n\nThe company has paid uninterrupted dividends for over 100 years and there is little doubt that it will stop or reduce them. 3M has seen many market ups and downs and has the potential to thrive through them all.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG)\n\nDividend yield-2.48% Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother dividend stock with over 100 years of dividend payments, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a highly steady and reliable stock to own in market uncertainty. The company holds a strong market share in the industry and\u00a0is known for a range of products that will never go out of demand.\n\nSince it offers products suitable for everyday use, the demand is not impacted by market ups and downs. The company started paying dividends in 1890 and has raised the payout to $1.0065 per share this year. It has hiked dividends for 68 years and enjoys a yield of 2.48%. Trading at $162, the stock is nearing the 52-week high but it is worth your money.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company recently announced the\u00a0quarterly results with\u00a0net sales of $20.2 billion and a 3% rise in organic sales. It returned $3.3 billion in cash to shareholders\u00a0in the form of\u00a0dividends and repurchases. Procter & Gamble has a dividend payout ratio of 56%\u00a0which is\u00a0higher than the sector average.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP)\n\nDividend yield- 2.86% Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nGlobal giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has become a household name today and the company owns a wide range of brands which helps ensure diversification. In the first-quarter results, the company beat earnings, driven by higher prices and growing international sales.\n\nIt saw a higher volume and sales growth in the international markets which led to a 2.3% rise in sales to hit $18.25 billion. The management reiterated the guidance for the year and is expecting the organic revenue to increase by 4%.\n\nTrading at $176, PEP stock is up 2% year-to-date and enjoys a dividend yield of 2.86%. The company has increased dividends for over 50 years and announced that it will increase the annual dividend by 7% starting June. With Pepsi, there is low risk and high return potential.\n\nBarclays analyst has a price target of $185 for the stock with an overweight rating while Jefferies analyst has a buy rating with a price target of $209.\n\nPfizer (PFE)\n\nDividend yield- 6.65% blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been struggling over the past year due to the massive drop in the sales of coronavirus vaccine. However, investors need to\u00a0keep in mind\u00a0that Pfizer is not limited to the vaccine and it was a successful business even before the pandemic hit us. The pharma company might be down today but there is\u00a0a lot\u00a0to look forward to.\n\nCurrently, Pfizer has 34 programs in phase 2 trials and 31 programs in phase 3 trials. It is also spending a\u00a0huge amount\u00a0of money on the research and development of cancer drugs which could be a game-changer for the business. The management thinks that in the next six years, they will have eight blockbuster drugs.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be impressed with the company if you looked at its finances now. Do not expect an immediate improvement in the top or bottom line but if you want to make passive income, PFE stock has a dividend yield of 6.65%. Trading at $25 today, the stock is a solid buy and the eventual progress on the clinical trials will take it higher but you will have to remain patient. Take home a steady income while you wait for big rewards.\n\nDividend Stocks For Steady Returns: Chevron (CVX)\n\nDividend yield-3.94% Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith soaring oil prices, Chevron (NYSE:CVX)\u00a0looks like a no-brainer buy now. The oil and gas giant is a cash flow machine with a strong upstream and downstream business. Due to its exposure to oil in the upstream production segment, Chevron is directly impacted by the soaring prices which leads to a higher revenue and margin.\n\nEven if the market crashes, Chevron can survive. However, oil prices will continue to remain strong due to the Middle East turmoil. In the\u00a0fourth-quarter results, the company saw a revenue of\u00a0$47.18 billion and the EPS stood at $3.45. The company returned $26.3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in 2023.\n\nChevron expects the production to increase 4% to 7% this year which will boost the revenue. Trading at $165 today, the stock is on an upward rally. The upcoming results could boost the stock higher. With a dividend yield of 3.94% and a dividend payout ratio of 57%, there is room for growth.\u00a0Analysts are bullish on the stock before the earnings.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\n\nDividend yield-3.08% Engineers in yellow jackets and hard hats looking at a laptop in a workshop\n\nOne of the largest energy companies in the world, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a blend of two businesses-a utility business and a renewable energy business. The company is steadily expanding its market share and is an industry leader. A dividend aristocrat, NextEra Energy recently reported results and maintained a dividend hike of 10% for 2024.\n\nIt has a strong reputation for rewarding shareholders and its future looks bright. NEE managed to add 2,765 megawatts of new renewables and storage capacity to the portfolio in the quarter. Its net income stood at $1.10 per share and the management maintained the annual guidance.\n\nNextEra Energy also expects to grow the dividends at 10% annually through at least 2026. As the demand for renewable energy soars, NextEra could be in a stronger position and we may\u00a0be able to\u00a0see higher dividend payouts. Trading at $66 today, NEE stock has a dividend yield of 3.08%. It is one of the best dividend stocks for steady returns to buy this year. Several analysts raised the price target of the stock after the quarterly results.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nDividend yield-2.42% McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a strong blue-chip stock to add to your portfolio.\u00a0No matter\u00a0the market situation, MCD continues to report impressive numbers due to its franchise business model. It aims to\u00a0take the number of\u00a0McDonald\u2019s franchises from 41,000 to 50,000 by 2027. Fundamentally, the company is in a strong position with a 37% rise in net income in 2023 and a 10% increase in sales.\n\nSince it does not own all the restaurants\u00a0across the globe, it manages to keep the operating costs down while ensuring steady returns through fees and royalties. However, the stock has been under pressure lately due to the high prices. The company is working on making changes to bring back the customers.\n\nAny dip in MCD stock is a chance to buy. The dividend aristocrat has a yield of 2.42%. Trading at $275 today, the stock is down 7% YTD but I think this slump will not last long and the upcoming results could lead the stock to rally.\n\nMCD is a highly defensive stock to buy and hold\u00a0for the long term. As consumer spending improves, we could see the restaurant stock soar to new highs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "McDonald's Corporation MCD is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings surprise of 5%.\n\nHow are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.70 per share, indicating an improvement of 2.7% from $2.63 reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $6.2 billion, suggesting growth of 4.6% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMcDonald's Corporation price-eps-surprise | McDonald's Corporation Quote\n\nLet's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nMcDonald's first-quarter top line is likely to have increased year over year courtesy of solid digital adoption, menu innovation and unit-expansion efforts. This and compelling value programs, growth in digital and delivery and pricing optimizations are likely to have driven comps improvement in the to-be-reported quarter. Our model predicts first-quarter comps to rise 4.2% year over year.\r\n\r\nWe expect total U.S. company-operated sales in first-quarter 2024 to be up nearly 3% year over year to $784.2 million.\n\nScrutiny of International trends, particularly in light of the management's comments (during fourth-quarter earnings call) regarding softness in China and the Middle East, underscores the complexities present. Dismal franchisee cash flows in the France region are likely to add to the negatives. Our model predicts first-quarter franchise revenues in the International Operated Markets to fall 5.7% year over year to $1.4 billion.\n\nGiven the substantial presence of McDonald's US co-owned stores in California, recent hikes in the California minimum wage are expected to have exerted pressure on the company\u2019s margins in the first quarter.\n\nOur Take\n\nInvestors should consider holding onto McDonald's shares due to its enduring strength and stability, underscored by a robust track record. With MCD\u2019s shares having gained 7.8% in the past six months compared with the industry's 14.9% rally, a cautious approach is warranted amid uncertain market signals. Restricting fresh entry into MCD during this period helps manage exposure to these uncertainties, allowing investors to await a more favorable entry point or a more precise trajectory for the company's performance.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for McDonald\u2019s this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: McDonald\u2019s has an Earnings ESP of +0.08%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates\n\nHere are some other stocks from the Zacks Retail-Wholesale space that investors may consider, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:\r\n\r\nWingstop Inc. WING has an Earnings ESP of +4.60% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe stock has risen 44.2% so far this year.

        "content": "Amazon is expected to report earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue of $142.495bn. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nEarnings season is in full swing, and investors have some high expectations for some of the mega-caps reporting next week such as Amazon and Apple. In the UK, investors should still keep a focus on Anglo American as the bid rejection from BHP is unlikely to be the last move by the Australian miner.\n\nIn Europe, the continent's most valuable company Novo Nordisk will show if it still reigns supreme.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2013 Reports on Tuesday 30 April\n\nAhead of the company\u2019s quarterly results, several analysts have been reaffirming their bullish views on the stock.\n\nAmazon is scheduled to report its first-quarter financial results after the US market close on 30 April. The company is expected to report earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue of $142.495bn, according to estimates from Benzinga Pro.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTotal net sales of $142.59bn are predicted, up from $127.36bn a year ago.\n\nWedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note that ads on Prime Video could generate about \"$6.5bn of incremental revenue\" once it is fully in place across the world.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his shareholder letter earlier this month that he thinks artificial intelligence could be the \"largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\"\n\nAmazon\u2019s market cap nearly reached $2tn for the first time in April and even after a slight pull back, the shares are still up by nearly a fifth in 2024 and by two-thirds over the past year (to rank it third among the Magnificent Seven, behind Nvidia [NVDA] and Meta [META]).\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Alphabet, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon and Anglo American\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons behind this stunning run is Amazon has re-established its powerful earnings momentum, which was briefly lost in late 2021 and early 2022, as fears of a recession gathered, inflation and interest rates rose, and oil prices increased input costs,\u201d according to investment director Russ Mould, head of financial analysis Danni Hewson and investment analyst Dan Coatsworth, all of AJ Bell.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAnother is the perception that Amazon is a winner in the race to lead, and monetise, the development of generative AI, thanks in particular to its cloud-service business AWS [Amazon Web Services] which makes far more money than the US and International retail arms and is the real heart of the business now. That said, North America roared back in 2023 to also record its highest-ever quarterly and annual operating profit, buoyed by free-spending US consumers,\u201d they added.\n\nApple (AAPL) \u2013 Reports on Thursday 2 May\n\nApple, one of the most important names in the stock market, but the iPhone maker\u2019s performance as been anything but stellar.\n\nThe stock is down 14% this year, making it one of the weakest performers among mega cap technology companies.\n\nThe consensus estimate for sales is $89.8bn, down 5.3% year-on-year (compared to the 2.1% year-on-year increase in Q1). In the unlikely event Apple gives any steer for Q3, analysts are looking for $82.7bn, up 1.0% year-on-year, according to AJ Bell.\n\nFor share earnings per share, or EPS, analysts are looking for $1.50 for net income of around $2bn, down a fraction from $1.52 a year ago. In Q3, analysts are looking for $1.31, marginally higher than in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAnalysts are split over the stock, with Morgan Stanley analysts expecting the iPhone maker will slightly top the consensus estimates.\n\nBank of America (BofA) also seems bullish, recommending the company given its \u201crich catalyst path with defensive cash flows\u201d, according to BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has a buy rating and $225 price target on the stock.\n\nMorningstar is wary of iPhone sales that have been hit by a sales slump in China.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks rise as traders digest US tech earnings and Bank of Japan decision\n\n\u201cWe anticipate a weak quarter for iPhone sales, which Apple has guided Wall Street to expect. This should spur a poorer overall quarter for the firm, as the iPhone remains its primary driver.\n\n\u201cWe expect another quarter of strong profitability for Apple helping offset weaker sales growth. Apple benefits from a higher mix of its services business and more consumers opting for premium options like the iPhone Pro models,\u201d Morningstar wrote.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence is also cautious, writing that Apple, given weaker iPhone demand in China, \u201cwill likely give fiscal 3Q sales guidance for the device below consensus\u2019 2% drop\u201d.\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nNot reporting but set to keep making markets move in the UK as in these mega deals the first bid rejection is just the start of negotiations to find the right price.\n\nBritish mining giant Anglo American has rejected a \u00a331.1bn takeover offer by Australian rival BHP (BHP.L).\n\nThe FTSE 100 miner said the bid was \u201copportunistic\u201d and \u201csignificantly undervalues Anglo American and its future prospects\u201d. Strong words but not enough to stop BHP, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s every chance BHP will come back to the table,\u201d said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nBHP said in a statement Thursday that it valued Anglo American shares at \u00a325.08 ($31.40) apiece, or \u00a331.1bn ($38.9bn) in total.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Anglo American has rejected BHP\u2019s takeover bid. Anglo American has long seen itself as one of the big players in the market and it certainly won\u2019t let a rival swoop on the business when its chips are down,\u201d AJ Bell\u2019s Mould said.\n\nRead more: Barclays profits slip amid mortgage squeeze\n\n\u201cThe usual playbook for mega deals in the resources space is for the original suitor to respond to rejection by coming back with a better offer, or someone else throwing their hat into the ring. That contender could be Rio Tinto (RIO.L) as it will certainly be watching activities with keen interest given it can see the same opportunity as BHP,\u201d he added.\n\nAnglo\u2019s shares surged by 16.1% on Thursday after news of the bid emerged and they are certain to be under the spotlight next week.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) \u2013 Reports Thursday 2 May\n\nThe US has the Magnificent 7, Europe has Novo Nordisk and friends, according to UBS. The investment bank has put together an equivalent list of 18 outperformers for Europe so this stock should definitely be on your radar when it reports next week.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that the pharma company sold 10.4bn Danish kroner\u2019s ($1.5bn/\u00a31.2bn) worth of its weight-loss drug Wegovy in the first quarter, more than twice the year-earlier figure, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIt is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.77, marking a 20.31% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nA steady ramp-up in starting dose scripts points to even bigger sales in the second half, Barclays said.\n\nCiti analysts said they would not be surprised to see the company adjust its full-year outlook as consensus is already close to the top of the forecast range.\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 38.79. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.05, according to Zacks Equity Research.\n\nNovo Nordisk has become Europe\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization, taking the crown from luxury group LVMH (LVMUY).\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday April 29\n\nParamount (PARA)\n\nVivendi (VIV.PA)\n\nTuesday April 30\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nLufthansa (LHAD.XD)\n\nAir France-KLM (AF.PA)\n\nVolkswagen (VOW.DE)\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nSantander (SAN.MC)\n\nSamsung (005930.KS)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nPaypal (PYPL)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nWednesday May 1\n\nNEXT (NXT.L)\n\neBay (EBAY)\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC)\n\nBarrick Gold (ABX.TO)\n\nMarriot International (MAR)\n\nThursday May 2\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nArcelorMittal (MT.AS)\n\nStandard Chartered (STAN.L)\n\nExpedia (EXPE)\n\nA.P.

        "title": "Steady Eddies: 7 Rock-Solid Stocks to Anchor Your Portfolio in April",
        "content": "Perhaps the biggest justification for steady stocks comes from an asset class completely unrelated to the equities market: cryptocurrencies. After the benchmark blockchain asset hit a record high earlier this year, the sector has struggled for traction.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily a surprising development either. Most prominently, geopolitical flashpoints threaten the stability of critical supply chains. Therefore, the turmoil could easily work its way down to us Americans, much like pouring water on an electric fence.\n\nOn another note, inflation has been stickier than experts anticipated. Here, a robust labor market isn\u2019t exactly helping matters. With so many serious challenges surrounding us, it\u2019s simply good practice to consider these steady stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nColgate-Palmolive (CL) Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrush\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nA consumer defensive play, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) makes plenty of sense as one of the stable stocks to consider. Operating under the household and personal products category, Colgate manufactures and sells various consumer products. The company conducts business through two units: Oral, Personal and Home Care and Pet Nutrition.\n\nFundamentally, Colgate benefits from permanent relevance. No matter what\u2019s going on with the economy, people need to care for themselves. As for the company\u2019s pet products segment, the underlying industry in the U.S. clocked in total revenue of $147 billion last year. That metric demonstrates continued growth in the space despite broader consumer headwinds.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate earnings per share of $3.49 on revenue of $20.15 billion. That\u2019s a modest improvement over last year\u2019s results of $3.23 per share on sales of $19.46 billion. Combined with a forward dividend yield of 2.25% and a strong buy assessment among analysts, CL is one of the top stable stocks to put on your radar.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Kenvue (KVUE) logo displayed on smartphone with company website in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nSpun off from healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) focuses exclusively on consumer health products. It operates via three segments: Self Care, Skin Health and Beauty, and Essential Health. Per its public profile, Kenvue levers multiple popular brands, including Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Nicorette, among many others.\n\nFor cautious investors, KVUE represents one of the steady stocks thanks to its every day need. From mouthcare to wound care to private hygiene products, Kenvue delivers the goods that people take for granted. Further, the company benefits from generational awareness of its product line. If your family used particular brands, it\u2019s probable that you\u2019ll use them yourself when you branch out on your own.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate the company will produce EPS of $1.14 on revenue of $15.63 billion. That\u2019s a mixed view, with EPS last year coming in at $1.29. However, sales landed at $15.44 billion in 2023.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hardly exciting, Kenvue offers a forward dividend yield of 4.13%. Thus, it\u2019s one of the steady stocks to consider.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen faced with a challenging economic cycle, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) could be the defensive retail name to choose. Yes, it must be stated that a broader impact to the consumer economy will likely affect WMT stock. At the same time, people just can\u2019t stop all spending. While Walmart carries some cyclical exposure, at its core, it\u2019s a defensive play.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, it\u2019s surprisingly robust. No, I wouldn\u2019t characterize the business as lighting up the board. However, in the last fiscal year, the company\u2019s average positive earnings beat came out to nearly 7%. Its worst performance was Q3, where EPS of 51 cents met the consensus target.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts are anticipating EPS of $2.36, a modest improvement over last year\u2019s $2.22. On the top line, they\u2019re projecting revenue of $673.45 billion, up 3.9% from last year\u2019s tally of $648.12 billion. Further, the next fiscal year could see sales move past the $700 billion mark. It\u2019s not exciting but it\u2019s definitely one of the steady stocks to consider.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nA fast-food giant, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. It\u2019s a staple of American capitalism. Further, the underlying products carry an addictive quality, perhaps due to the high fat and salt content. What\u2019s undeniable is that the Golden Arches is super convenient. You can be in and out with your order and that makes MCD quite intriguing, especially under social normalization trends.\n\nWhile McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t a snazzy investment by any stretch of the imagination, it gets the job done. Last fiscal year, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise landed at 9.35%. Its best performance occurred in Q2, with EPS of $3.17 beating out the consensus view of $2.79.\n\nFor the current year, experts peg EPS at $12.40, a solid improvement over last year\u2019s print of $11.94. Also, revenue of $26.85 billion represents a 5.3% improvement over 2023\u2019s tally of $25.49 billion. McDonald\u2019s also offers a forward yield of 2.41%, presenting a solid case for steady stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is officially listed under the infrastructural software space, it\u2019s difficult to classify the enterprise. It\u2019s really an everyman in the broader technology sector. For one thing, it\u2019s Office 365 suite \u2013 which includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint among other programs \u2013 is indispensable. It\u2019s operating system simply owns the PC market. Notably, the company established a foothold in artificial intelligence with its timely investments.\n\nEven better, the results show up in the financial statements and the charts. Last year, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%. Its best report was Q3, where it produced EPS of $2.73 against a consensus view of $2.42. Over the past 52 weeks, MSFT stock gained almost 49%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe Microsoft can deliver EPS of $11.63 on revenue of $244.21 billion. That\u2019s a significant leap from last year\u2019s results of $9.81 per share on sales of $211.91 billion. Given its current momentum, these expectations seem quite reasonable.\n\nSempra (SRE) The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be fair, utility stalwart Sempra (NYSE:SRE) hasn\u2019t been the most iron tight among steady stocks. SRE is down 5% since the beginning of the year and lost almost 9% of value over the past 52 weeks. That said, it\u2019s difficult to argue with the fundamentals. Based in San Diego, California, Sempra covers a large area of the Golden State.\n\nWhile there\u2019s always political criticism of California, the fact is that it\u2019s the economic engine of the U.S. As well, it\u2019s a state that features an international border and is home to vital ports facing the Pacific Ocean. Factor in the temperate climate and it\u2019s a highly desirable location. Further, because it\u2019s home to so many businesses, people tend to earn higher wages.\n\nBasically, Sempra\u2019s natural monopoly benefits from a combination of desirability and ongoing economic vitality. That makes the company\u2019s forward dividend yield of 3.44% very credible. In addition, Sempra consistently beats its bottom-line quarterly targets. For the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate EPS of $4.81, an improvement over last year\u2019s $4.61.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s credible and so it\u2019s an investment you can trust.\n\nMarathon Petroleum (MPC) Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.com\n\nOperating in the oil and gas refining and marketing category, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) also operates a midstream business. Fundamentally, Marathon should benefit from economic resilience. The world still runs on oil (quite literally). So, even with disruptions and higher energy prices, people must pay up. Otherwise, the consequences of not doing so will outweigh the cost savings.\n\nThat\u2019s a terribly cynical way to look at the downstream business but it\u2019s also unavoidable. Further, with the geopolitical backdrop pointing toward a possible supply squeeze via disruptions to global logistics outflows, MPC stock has been on the move. Since the start of the year, shares have gained nearly 31% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, they\u2019re up about 62%.\n\nNotably, in Q4 of last year, the company posted an earnings surprise of 80.9%. Therefore, it\u2019s questionable that projections call for fiscal 2024 earnings and sales to decline against 2023 results. Rather, it\u2019s possible that the upper end of the revenue target of $160 billion could be reached. If so, that should bolster the bottom line.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald's (MCD) Stock Moves -0.42%: What You Should Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) closed the most recent trading day at $275.60, moving -0.42% from the previous trading session. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's 0.46% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.98%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.64%.\n\nShares of the world's biggest hamburger chain have depreciated by 1.87% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 3.05% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.04%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of McDonald's in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on April 30, 2024. In that report, analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings of $2.70 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 2.66%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.17 billion, up 4.68% from the year-ago period.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $12.34 per share and revenue of $26.92 billion, indicating changes of +3.35% and +5.59%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.29% decrease. As of now, McDonald's holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, McDonald's is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 22.43. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.75, so one might conclude that McDonald's is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nMeanwhile, MCD's PEG ratio is currently 3.02. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Retail - Restaurants industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.95 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 152, positioning it in the bottom 40% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "10 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best consumer discretionary dividend stocks to buy according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer discretionary sector and its performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nConsumer discretionary stocks are highly influenced by market conditions and consumer sentiment. These equities perform exceptionally well during periods of a bullish economy and when consumer spending is high. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary had one of the best years on record in 2023, returning over 41%. The index is down by 1.89% this year so far due to wavering consumer confidence. Shopping habits among people have reverted back to normal after the pandemic, which has led to a notable rise in online sales. Wall Street analysts have expressed their confidence in continued consumer spending. According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts anticipate that revenue and earnings for consumer discretionary companies in the S&P 500 will exceed overall market growth for the second consecutive year in 2024.\n\nThis outlook is supported by the sector\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. During this period, the average gross margin for both consumer discretionary and consumer staples companies within the Russell 3000 grew to 34%, compared to 31% four quarters earlier, as reported by Bloomberg. In contrast, the average gross margin for firms in the broader index, representing about 98% of investable US equities, slightly rose to 40% from 39% over the same period. The report further referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices and mentioned that consumer discretionary and consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 ramped up their share buybacks significantly. Consumer discretionary firms increased their spending by 53%, while consumer staples saw an even larger increase of 80% in Q4 2023. These figures exceeded the average growth of 18% observed for the broader index.\n\nThough the sector has reported losses this year so far, analysts are positive about its performance going forward. Jordan Michaels, a Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, suggested that lower inflation and a pause to the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-hike cycle could prove beneficial for the sector. This could lead to increased consumer willingness to invest in significant purchases like automobiles or homes. In addition to this, the sector may benefit further from an economic scenario where the economy avoids recession and labor markets maintain strength. He further mentioned that there is a potential value in the retail companies within the sector. Here are some of his comments:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOne particular continued area of opportunity has been select retailers. Some of these companies have defensive aspects to their business models, which could provide a degree of insulation if the economic outlook worsens.\u201d\n\nIn addition to delivering strong performance in 2023, the consumer discretionary sector also distributed the highest dividends during this period. According to a report by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, the companies in the industry led the way with the highest percentage increase in annual dividends, achieving a notable 26.1% year-over-year growth. The sector showed a 13.7% growth in its dividend payments on an underlying basis, which is also the highest among all the sectors. The report also highlighted that annual dividends in the consumer discretionary sector have grown from $80.7 billion in 2017 to $106.8 billion in 2023.\n\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the best dividend stocks from the consumer discretionary sector among others that are discussed below. 10 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nA side profile of a consumer within a store handing a credit card to a cashier, reflecting the debt collection services of the company.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned the 53 holdings of the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index.

        "title": "Have $500? 4 Absurdly Cheap Stocks Long-Term Investors Should Buy Right Now",
        "content": "One tried-and-true path to great returns as an investor is to buy shares of strong companies that have fallen out of favor on Wall Street. These businesses are often enduring challenges that threaten the next year or two of earnings, but not the wider growth picture. In that way, you expose yourself to short-term paper losses in exchange for impressive gains over many years. In effect, you're being paid to be patient.\n\nOf course, many stocks are cheap for reasons that do impair the company's long-term growth prospects. The challenge is to avoid these situations while singling out the truly temporary corporate stumbles. Let's look at a few attractive candidates that fit the bill.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) stock missed most of the pandemic-era rally in 2021 and then was left out of the post-pandemic market surge over the past year. As a result, shares of the beverage titan have risen by just 24% in the past five years compared to the 73% increase in the S&P 500 over that time.\n\nYet, Coke remains a formidable business with sales volumes rising along with prices in 2023. Earnings are stellar and profit margin is well above that of rival PepsiCo. The company generates enough cash to pay one of the most stable, longest-running dividends on the market.\n\nAnd its growth prospects are solid as rising demand for waters, energy drinks, and other new niches offset declines in the more traditional soda portfolio.\n\n2. Electronic Arts\n\nElectronic Arts(NASDAQ: EA) is playing a game that's stacked in its favor. The video game publisher owns a huge collection of intellectual property that spans popular niches like sports and casual games. Steady growth in its audience size (and monetization rates) has helped annual revenue rise to $8 billion from less than $4 billion a decade ago.\n\nGames are becoming more profitable as the selling model shifts to more of a software-as-a-service approach. EA is a leader in this arena, with subscription services accounting for 70% of annual sales. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth following the pandemic spike, but savvy investors can look past that volatility toward EA's much brighter potential in 2025 and beyond.\n\n3. McDonald's\n\nFears about a recent growth slowdown should have investors salivating at the discounted price of McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) stock. The fast-food chain noted that customer traffic dropped into negative territory at the start of 2024, which is never great news for a restaurant business. Fewer guests means fewer opportunities to sell new menu items or those core sandwiches (like the Big Mac) that have been staples for decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's has been through many similar challenges in its years sitting at the top of the fast-food industry. It will emerge from this slump, too, with help from promotions and a deeper push into the drive-thru and home delivery segments.\n\nIn the meantime, investors can collect its tasty dividend payment and marvel at McDonald's industry-leading profit margin. The chain is aiming to push operating profit toward 50% of sales over the next few years, in fact.\n\n4. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares haven't budged in the past year even as the wider market rallied over 20%. There's no shortage of concerns about this member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" including sluggish growth in China, flat demand for its hardware products, and relatively weak profitability when compared to rivals like Microsoft.\n\nIt would be a mistake to bet against the iPhone maker over the long term. It has the biggest installed base in the industry, with 2.2 billion users interacting with its brand through the tech titan's hardware. That's a huge audience it can market to for its next several product launches, whether they're iterative updates or revolutionary entries into new categories.\n\nApple looks cheap at its current valuation sitting below 7 times annual sales. Toss in ample cash generation ($40 billion just this past quarter), and you've got a recipe for crisp investor returns from here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Countdown to McDonald's (MCD) Q1 Earnings: A Look at Estimates Beyond Revenue and EPS",
        "content": "Wall Street analysts forecast that McDonald's (MCD) will report quarterly earnings of $2.70 per share in its upcoming release, pointing to a year-over-year increase of 2.7%. It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $6.17 billion, exhibiting an increase of 4.7% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 0.7% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some McDonald's metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenues- Total Franchised revenues' stands at $3.75 billion. The estimate points to a change of +4.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenues- Total Company-operated sales' of $2.35 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.5%.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Total Other revenues' reaching $79.72 million. The estimate points to a change of -7.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenues- Company-operated sales- International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate' should arrive at $203.68 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Comparable sales growth - U.S. - YoY change' to reach 2.6%. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 12.6% in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Comparable sales growth - International Operated Markets - YoY change' will reach 3.2%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 12.6%.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Comparable sales growth - International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate - YoY change' should come in at 1.2%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 12.6% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Systemwide restaurants - Total Systemwide' at 42,128. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 40,535.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Comparable sales growth - Total - YoY change' will reach 2.5%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 12.6%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Systemwide restaurants - Total International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate' will reach 18,358. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 16,977.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Systemwide restaurants - Total International Operated Markets' to come in at 10,298. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 10,112 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Systemwide restaurants - Total U.S.' will likely reach 13,466. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 13,446.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for McDonald's here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, McDonald's shares have recorded returns of -1.9% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3% change.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "Recent market volatility may have many market participants buying major tech stocks on the dip, but the genuine opportunity may lie with blue-chip stocks to buy on the dip. Blue chips can be a great cornerstone for your portfolio.\n\nRepresenting ownership in venerable companies with consistent cash flow, blue chips typically experience steady price appreciation. Couple that with consistent dividends and dividend growth, and the total returns from such stocks can be quite solid.\n\nYes, it\u2019s not only market turbulence that has knocked down many blue-chip stocks over the past few months. Company-specific factors have played a role as well. However, in many such cases, these headwinds are temporary and have become overly priced into shares.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s dive in, and see why the following seven blue-chip stocks to buy on the dip this month offer the opportunity to buy high-quality at a more-than-reasonable price.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy on the Dip: CVS Health (CVS) The logo for CVS Pharmacy is displayed on a retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is best known for its chain of pharmacies. However, the company is a diversified health care provider, owning other health services businesses like insurer Aetna.\n\nThere are positives to this vertical integration, but for now, these are being outweighed by big negatives. Sector-wide, costs are rising faster than revenue, putting the squeeze on profitability.\n\nFollowing the release of the latest Medicare Advantage plan increases, the market believes this headwind is worsening for CVS stock. However, that may not actually be the case.\n\nAs Seeking Alpha commentator Envision Research recently argued, investors are overestimating how much the MA news affects future results. As I pointed out back in February, CVS is currently implementing a sweeping turnaround plan.\n\nRepresenting good value, at just 8.3 times forward earnings and a dividend yield of 3.88%, improved results could eventually lead to a massive rerating for shares.\n\nHershey (HSY) Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden table\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/VG Foto\n\nHershey (NYSE:HSY) is another example of blue-chip stocks to buy on the dip where short-term pain could be the prelude to big-time gains.\n\nThis leading confectionary company has been materially affected by the big jump in cocoa prices.\n\nFearful of the impact of this price shock on profitability, the market has bid down HSY stock in a big way. Shares trade at multiyear lows. Yet while that\u2019s been bad news for existing shareholders, as I recently argued, for new shareholders, this could be a \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy? For one, at just 19.4 times forward earnings, Hershey trades well below its historic price-to-earnings multiple. Not only that but with this big price decline, HSY\u2019s forward dividend yield of 2.93% is pretty high for a blue chip. Once this major headwind passes, HSY will likely surge back toward prior price levels.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast May, it may have seemed as if Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) many years of sideways price performance were ending. That\u2019s when the diversified drug and medical device company spun-off its slower growing Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) unit.\n\nBut while the company\u2019s fiscal results have beat expectations in recent quarters, JNJ stock has been under pressure, do to another perceived negative. That would be the company\u2019s billions in potential legal liabilities stemming from its past sale of talc-based products.\n\nHowever, the company continues to pursue a broad resolution to this long-standing issue. Already knocked lower by talc-related concerns, any bit of positive news regarding this may drive a big rally for the stock.\n\nCurrently, JNJ trades for only 14 times forward earnings. Historically, shares have traded at a valuation in the high-teens/low-20s. This \u201cdividend king\u201d also sports a 3.32% forward yield.\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBetween October and March, Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) was on a tear. Shares in the home improvement retailer zoomed from the low-$180s up to $262.49 per share. Unfortunately, this hot run has come to an end. Over the past month, LOW has dropped by double-digits.\n\nHowever, this sell-off has arguably made LOW stock one of the blue-chip stocks to buy on the dip. Although Lowes\u2019 latest guidance disappointed investors, this slump may prove temporary.\n\nPer forecasts, after declining this fiscal year (ending January 2025), earnings are expected to grow by around 10% during the following two fiscal years.\n\nA big reason behind this is the company\u2019s aggressive repurchasing of its own shares. These could in time provide a steady boost for shares.\n\nFor long-term investors, keep in mind that 1.88%-yielding LOW is another of the \u201cdividend kings,\u201d with 60 years of consecutive dividend growth.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy on the Dip: McDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nLook at recent headlines about the \u201cGolden Arches,\u201d and it\u2019s clear why McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock has been under pressure. There\u2019s been a lot of attention paid to the fact that this fast food chain has raised menu prices considerably over the past decade.\n\nThese headlines underscore a key concern: high prices are leading to reduced demand from low-income consumers.\n\nHowever, investors may be overestimating the long-term impact of this supposed demand destruction. Much like in prior slumps, McDonald\u2019s is making big product changes to win back customers.\n\nAnalysts still expect McDonald\u2019s to report steady earnings growth in 2025 and 2026. Since the recent pullback may not last long, you may want to consider buying MCD stock after this recent dip.\n\nBesides appreciation potential, MCD is a \u201cdividend aristocrat\u201d that has increased its payout by an average of 8% annually over the past five years.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn recent months, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has been affected by both a major cyberattack, as well an antitrust investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe health services giant is still dealing with the fallout from the cyberattack. It\u2019s unclear whether the DOJ\u2019s investigation will lead to an antitrust suit.\n\nHowever, after sliding lower last winter, UNH stock has started to bounce back. In large part thanks to strong quarterly results. While bad from a PR standpoint, the cyberattack has clearly not affected fiscal results.\n\nAlthough the antitrust risk looms, this may be more than accounted for in UNH\u2019s valuation of 17.8 times forward earnings.\n\nThat\u2019s a bargain valuation, when you consider that forecasts still call for continued double-digit earnings growth in the coming years. With all of this in mind, consider UNH one of the blue-chip stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past month, Visa (NYSE:V) shares have pulled back, albeit slightly.\n\nBesides market volatility, news of the credit card processor and its rival, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), agreeing to reduce merchant swipe fees as part of a legal settlement may be driving these declines.\n\nHowever, this may not any sort of crushing blow for the company, or for V stock, going forward. As Mizuho\u2019s Dan Dolev argued following the swipe fee settlement news, this settlement could prove to be a positive, as it could help lessen regulatory pressure.\n\nOn a longer time frame, what remains most important is that global payment trends remain favorable. As I\u2019ve pointed out before, in the coming decades, trillions worth of annual transactions are set to move from cash to cashless methods.\n\nThis trend will likely sustain elevated growth for Visa. Hence, V remains one of the best blue chips to buy and hold.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the latest market close, McDonald's (MCD) reached $276.75, with a -0.05% movement compared to the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.02% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.11%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.1%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had lost 0.62% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 2.56% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.01% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of McDonald's in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on April 30, 2024. On that day, McDonald's is projected to report earnings of $2.70 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 2.66%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.17 billion, up 4.68% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.34 per share and revenue of $26.92 billion, which would represent changes of +3.35% and +5.59%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.29% lower. McDonald's currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, McDonald's is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 22.44. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.97.\n\nMeanwhile, MCD's PEG ratio is currently 3.02. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Retail - Restaurants industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.95.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 159, this industry ranks in the bottom 37% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

        "title": "Chipotle blows by earnings estimates as resilient foot traffic, margin expansion boost Q1 results",
        "content": "Chipotle rang up another bowl of positive earnings on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nFor its first quarter, revenue grew 14.1% to $2.7 billion, with same-store sales jumping by 7%, higher than estimates of 5.13%. The company also beat expectations on the bottom line, with adjusted earnings per share coming in at $13.37, compared to estimates of $11.66.\n\nShares rose 3% in after market trading.\n\nLimited-time offers like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken al Pastor, which are priced at a premium, boosted results against a difficult macro consumer backdrop. The chain saw a 5.4% increase in foot traffic, but the average check was only up 1.6%, lower than the 2.0% expected.\n\nCEO Brian Niccol called the quarter \"outstanding,\" with improvement in store throughput and successful marketing initiatives. The results provides \"confidence that we can achieve our long-term target of more than doubling our business in North America and expanding internationally,\" he said.\n\nIn Q1, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants, with 43 locations having its drive-thru feature Chipotlane. This year, it expects to open 285 to 315 new locations, with more than 80% of them having the drive-thru concept. Long term, it plans to operate 7,000 restaurants in North America (there are currently 3,500).\n\nFor 2024, the company expects sales growth of mid to high-single digits, up from the previous guidance of mid-single digit growth.\n\nPrior to the results, Lauren Silberman of Deutsche Bank wrote in a client note that \"Chipotle has been among the best-performing restaurant stocks.\"\n\nChipotle's operating margin expanded to 16.3%, up from 15.5% compared to a year ago, while restaurant level margins also jumped slightly, from 25.6% to 27.5%.\n\nIn its earnings call, Wall Street will be listening for updates regarding its automation efforts, such as its guacamole prep robot, Autocado. CEO Brian Niccol told Yahoo Finance that the machine is close to deployment.\n\n\"We're already on like our third or fourth prototype [of Autocado], and now we're like, OK, this is ready to go into a restaurant. I'm sure when we put it in the restaurant, we'll learn something that might cause us to iterate one more time.\"\n\nInvestors will also wait to hear how California's FAST Act, which increased fast food wages to $20 per hour, impacted its business in the state. Analysts agreed that Chipotle is among the companies that have the brand power and fanbase to adjust to the change.\n\n\"I think brands who provide a lot of value and have good traffic are best positioned,\" said Peter Saleh of BTIG, who pointed out that Chipotle's chicken bowl averages $9 across the country, compared to $12 to $13 for many burger meals.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"They've built quite a bit of momentum in their business with respect to traffic,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower told Yahoo Finance. Workers help a customer at a Chipotle restaurant on April 01, 2024 in San Rafael, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nIn a client note written prior to the results, Sharon Zackfia of William Blair said about 14% of Chipotle's total locations are in the Golden State, and she suspects Chipotle raised prices about 7% in the state to cover incremental labor cost pressure.\n\nHere's what Chipotle reported in Q1, compared to what Wall Street expected, according to Bloomberg estimates:\n\nRevenue: $2.70 billion versus$2.67 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $13.37 versus $11.66 Same-store sales growth: 7% versus 5.13% Transactions growth: 5.4% versus 3.03% Average check growth: 1.6% versus 2.00%\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Yum Brands (YUM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Yum Brands (YUM) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 1, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.2%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $1.72 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum?\n\nFor Yum, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.85%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Yum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yum would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.26, delivering a surprise of -9.35%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nYum doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nMcDonald's (MCD), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.70 for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.17 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for McDonald's has been revised 0.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.08%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that McDonald's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Are we headed for a repeat of 2022\u2019s brutal selloff? While no one can predict the future with certainty, current market trends are raising some ominous red flags. After a meteoric rally fueled by the AI craze, many investors seem to be taking profits off the table. And who can blame them? The surge we\u2019ve witnessed is eerily reminiscent of the 2021 rally.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the potential domino effect for certain sectors. With tech and AI stocks commanding such hefty weightings in the major indexes, a selloff in these sectors could drag the broader market down\u00a0with it. Some even fear such a selloff could induce a full-blown\u00a0recession,\u00a0as panic-stricken companies scramble to beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates in a desperate bid to revive their share prices.\n\nOf course, this could\u00a0just\u00a0be a temporary 10% hiccup, akin to the summer 2023 correction we weathered. But if you\u2019re keen on protecting those hard-earned gains, it might be wise to shift into a defensive stance \u2013 at least for\u00a0the time being. Here are seven defensive stocks worth considering as you batten down the hatches.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a defensive stock that should be on every investor\u2019s radar, especially if\u00a0we\u2019re headed\u00a0for a market downturn. This fast-food titan has some of the stickiest demand\u00a0out there\u00a0\u2013 an impressive feat for a restaurant company where demand is typically cyclical.\n\nIndeed, McDonald\u2019s has defied the odds time and again. The company delivered solid returns even during the Great Recession, barely taking a scratch during the COVID pandemic, bouncing back faster than most. The fact that McDonald\u2019s managed to deliver good performance even when restaurants were shutting down worldwide is a testament to the resilience of its business model. If there\u2019s a recession strong enough to knock down McDonald\u2019s, the stock market might be the least of your concerns.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, McDonald\u2019s boasts a stellar 33% net margin, better than 98% of the restaurant industry. With a 3-year revenue growth rate of nearly 11%, this mature company is one of the best performers in its space. The stock\u2019s forward dividend yield of 2.4% sweetens the deal even further, providing a nice income stream to cushion any potential volatility. In short, McDonald\u2019s is one of the top defensive stocks that should be a core holding in any downturn-proof portfolio.\n\nHuntington\u00a0Ingalls Industries (HII) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) is the largest military shipbuilding company in the United States. This global, all-domain defense provider also offers professional services to partners in government and industry. And here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 Huntington builds ships in more classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you should know, it\u2019s that government contracts are some of the stickiest sources of revenue out there. Huntington Ingalls has big money locked down in a very lucrative industry. And with China ramping up its naval military production way beyond the U.S., I see the military shipbuilding space heating up even more. I doubt military spending would slow even if a\u00a0bad\u00a0recession takes place, given the hot geopolitical environment.\n\nSo,\u00a0you\u00a0can expect HII stock to keep delivering consistent, safe returns.\u00a0The company\u2019s 1.9% dividend yield also makes it worthwhile to hold the stock,\u00a0despite its lack of flashiness.\u00a0However, if a war\u00a0breaks out\u00a0that requires substantial naval power, expect the company\u2019s growth to get\u00a0a lot\u00a0flashier.\n\nFlowers Foods (FLO) bakery breads, buns and pastries on a wooden cutting board in a display case\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ampersandphoto\n\nFlowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) is one of my favorite defensive stocks for reliable long-term returns. The trajectory of this stock over the past two years has been essentially unbroken, and despite a recent correction, it\u2019s back to compounding again. It\u2019s a lot like McDonald\u2019s in the sense that it\u2019s a discretionary name, but the demand here is\u00a0very\u00a0sticky and growing steadily. It\u2019s unlikely to disappoint from these levels.\n\nFlower Foods\u2019 dividend yield of 3.7% is\u00a0also especially\u00a0juicy here. I don\u2019t see massive swings in either direction for this stock, but the main aim of this article is to find stable picks, and this one is\u00a0definitely\u00a0not going much further down from current levels. You\u2019re paying just 20-times earnings and\u00a01-times forward sales for one of the most stable companies with\u00a0big\u00a0dividend payouts. Moreover, we could see earnings climb\u00a0substantially\u00a0once rates\u00a0are cut, as this company spends a lot of money on interest payments.\n\nColgate-Palmolive (CL) Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrush\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) needs no introduction \u2013 it\u2019s a household name synonymous with reliable, recession-proof products. This consumer staples giant has some of the stickiest demand out there, unlikely to be knocked down by any economic downturn. The company offers stability and reliability in a volatile market, with a wide portfolio of products that people buy regardless of market conditions.\n\nThe stock\u2019s chart is about as boring as it gets if you zoom out, and that\u2019s precisely what you want during turbulent times. Even though Colgate has delivered some solid gains recently, I expect it to remain a steady\u00a0Eddie\u00a0going forward. This is exactly the kind of stock you\u2019d want to hold during a downturn. Just sit on that 2.26% dividend yield and let it compound while most other stocks shave a third of their value. You could then emerge from that storm as a winner.\n\nSure, the company\u2019s dividend growth has been weak, but Colgate remains a reliable source of income with over 60 years of consecutive raises.\n\nCardinal Health (CAH) Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHealthcare stocks like Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) are unavoidable if you\u2019re looking to build a stable portfolio. These companies have incredibly sticky demand, as health is not something you can compromise on. Moreover, American healthcare is notorious for being expensive, and domestic companies have immense pricing power that\u2019s not hugely restricted by the government. Cardinal Health has almost doubled since early 2022, and while the stock has seen downturns historically, those dips weren\u2019t drastic, and the company recovered quickly.\n\nYou\u2019re\u00a0definitely\u00a0paying a premium for this stock, but the company\u2019s execution is worth the price tag. Cardinal is expected to see 10.4% revenue growth and 26% earnings per share growth in 2024, and the stock has a forward dividend yield of 1.95%. All of that for just 14-times forward earnings is still very attractive, especially when you consider the company\u2019s neutral balance sheet.\n\nDollar General (DG) Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, midday\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve been pounding the table on Dollar General (NYSE:DG) for quite some time after its plunge. It\u2019s the only stock on this list that has declined considerably. However, I still call it one of the safest bets right now because of that very decline. The stock is unlikely to go down much further, and a recovery has already started to take shape.\u00a0In fact,\u00a0I believe multi-bagger returns are possible here within a decade if you buy at current levels.\n\nThe expectations going forward can be described as pitiful, and we all know that established retail companies hardly disappoint when consumer confidence and spending inevitably bounce back and the company\u2019s stock returns to a fairer valuation. Dollar General also has a 1.65% forward dividend yield, so you\u2019ll be rewarded for holding it through the storm. Gurufocus\u2019 model puts the fair value for the stock at $272 right now. The stock currently trades at a paltry $143.\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS) stocks to buy: construction workers work on a concrete floor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOtis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS) is a company that makes escalators, moving walkways, and other vertical transportation equipment. The stock doesn\u2019t have much of a history since the company went public fairly recently in 2020. However, I believe this company has the ingredients to remain a sticky business even during tough times.\n\nOtis has strong underlying growth drivers, driven by an extensive portfolio of elevator units that could drive multiple expansion in the years ahead. We\u2019re looking at a very stable 10% annual earrings growth going forward, along with 4% annual revenue growth. There\u2019s also a 1.4% forward dividend yield to consider.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that elevator companies like Otis not only generate revenue from new elevator sales; they\u2019re also needed for routine upkeep of the huge amount of elevator units they operate. This leads to a very good base of recurring revenue that\u2019ll keep the business running during tough times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "50% of Billionaire Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Portfolio Is in These 3 Companies -- and They're Not Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Bill Ackman is one of the most well-known billionaire investors and is the head of the Pershing Square hedge fund. However, unlike many of his billionaire peers in the industry, Ackman is a value investor at heart and primarily invests in easy-to-understand businesses at a perceived discount, as opposed to trying to put his money in the next big thing.\n\nAccording to Pershing's latest U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, there are only seven different stocks in the portfolio, and only one of them is a technology stock. In fact, Ackman's three largest non-tech positions make up about 50% of the portfolio's entire market value. Here's what they are and why Ackman might be so confident in them.\n\n1. Chipotle\n\nPershing Square's largest non-technology investment is Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). The hedge fund owns about $1.9 billion worth of the fast-casual chain's stock, and it has been a big winner for Ackman and his team. Pershing paid about $436 per share for its Chipotle stock. By the end of 2023, it had a gain of about 425%.\n\nChipotle, which recently announced a 50-to-1 stock split, is trading near all-time highs, and it isn't hard to see why. Not only is Chipotle a highly profitable business with a 12.5% net margin (high for a restaurant operator), but it is still growing fast, with annualized revenue growth of more than 18% over the past three years.\n\nDespite its stellar performance, there could be plenty of room to grow. Chipotle currently operates about 3,400 restaurants (mostly in the United States) and plans to double the U.S. store count over time. The company will also focus on international expansion. It sees potential for a total of 10,000 locations, which seem rather reasonable given that it would still have roughly one-fourth of the stores of McDonald's(NYSE: MCD).\n\n2. Restaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International(NYSE: QSR) is the parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs. It accounts for 17.6% of Pershing Square's stock portfolio, and the $1.8 billion investment represents a 7.4% stake in the restaurant operator.\n\nThe company's business model mainly consists of selling franchising rights to owner/operators, and there are more than 30,000 franchised locations among its four brands. It has a highly profitable business model, with a net margin of nearly 25%, and has grown its revenue at a 12.4% annualized rate over the past three years. It's also a solid dividend stock, with a 3.1% yield at the current share price. With the company investing heavily in reinvigorating the Burger King brand, there could be significant growth potential in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Hilton\n\nHotel operator Hilton (NYSE: HLT) makes up about 16.2% of Pershing Square's portfolio and is the newest of the three positions on the list. Ackman has been investing in Hilton since late 2018 (the other two were started in 2016 and 2014, respectively), and the stock has roughly doubled since that time.\n\nNot only has Hilton's business performed well, with revenue up 80% over the past two years, but the company continues to expand its global footprint and reinvest in its properties. Its iconic brand and scale give it a big competitive advantage, and with travel demand having been surprisingly resilient despite inflation, now could be a good time to add some exposure to your portfolio.\n\nShould you take a closer look?\n\nTo be sure, I'd never suggest buying a particular stock just because a billionaire did. But these are three highly profitable and well-run businesses with significant growth potential in the years to come. If you're looking for some non-tech exposure in your portfolio, they could be worth a closer look.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "McDonald's (MCD) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "The market expects McDonald's (MCD) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis world's biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $6.17 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.71% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald's?\n\nFor McDonald's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that McDonald's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that McDonald's would post earnings of $2.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.95, delivering a surprise of +4.98%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nMcDonald's appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAnother stock from the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Yum China Holdings (YUMC), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -4.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.94 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Yum China has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.14%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Yum China will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 7 Best Positioned Dow Stocks for April 2024",
        "content": "I\u2019d argue that investing in the Dow in April is a particularly smart move. Dow Jones stocks represent 30 of the most prominent U.S. firms. Stocks listed in the Dow tend to be more defensive than the Nasdaq and other indices.\n\nThe reason that matters is that investors are currently seeking safety. Rate cut expectations are softening and treasury yields rising. That combination of factors is strongly suggestive of softness for more tech-oriented shares and other growth stocks. Conversely, it is a boon for more defensive stocks like those found on the Dow.\n\nDow stocks tend to be more defensive although they certainly have significant growth potential in some cases. Anyway, they look strong at the moment as the markets digest the latest news on rate cuts and Treasury yields.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the index generally looks strong there are better positions therein. Let\u2019s take a look at seven of those.\n\nDow Stocks: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMention the name Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0and most investors immediately associate it with e-commerce first. That\u2019s logical given that Amazon\u2019s online shopping platform is the primary driver of the stock\u2019s performance.\n\nHowever, Amazon is so much more. That\u2019s what I want to talk about: Amazon\u2019s other efforts and why they should inspire investors to plow money into it.\n\nThe next most\u00a0important business segment for Amazon is its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon is the leader in the cloud segment with a substantial lead over its main rival, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nCloud is particularly important at the moment as it is a primary investment area for artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon is making massive moves there. The company recently announced that it will invest $150 billion over the next 15 years in cloud AI. Thus, it\u2019s clear that Amazon intends to dominate the cloud via its investment in the necessary muscle for increased AI compute workloads.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon continues to battle Walmart (NYSE:WMT) for retail dominance. Remember, Walmart is the largest grocer in the United States. Amazon is expanding its grocery store footprint through Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods. In short, there are multiple reasons to believe that Amazon continues to be among the best positioned Dow stocks in April and beyond.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI can give readers at least two strong, logical reasons that Visa (NYSE:V) stock is an excellent investment.\n\nThe first is simply that credit card usage and credit card debt continue to soar to new historical highs. Current American credit card debt sits at a massive balance of $1.129 trillion. Balances have risen by $273 billion since the fourth quarter of 2021. To give a bit more context, total credit card debt was below $500 billion at the turn of the millennium. The point here is simple and powerful: credit card issuers like Visa are very well positioned to capitalize on surging credit usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Visa is the most widely accepted credit card globally. That\u2019s particularly important as the world increasingly moves toward a more cashless global society.\u00a0 Speaking anecdotally, I was recently visiting Korea which is quickly becoming a cashless society.\u00a0 My Visa card was accepted everywhere. Fintech will continue to grow and Visa has a strong lead through the massive Network it has built over several decades.\n\nDow Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft stock, along with many other tech shares, is currently being punished by the markets as the rate cut fears increase and treasury yields rise. Investors should take this brief opportunity to pick up Microsoft shares as it will not last.\n\nShare prices have fallen from $427 to $403 as I write this. The S&P 500 continues to fall as the markets wonder whether there will be any rate cuts at all in 2024. Treasury yields are also rising causing investors to diversify away from the stock market and into perceived safety. The result is that Microsoft shares are currently cheap.\n\nFor those wondering if Microsoft is suddenly on the precipice of a long drawdown, don\u2019t worry. Instead, look at its most recent earnings report. Remember how large Microsoft is. Then, consider that its revenues grew by 18% in the period.\n\nAfter you digested that fact, then consider its cloud revenues grew by 24%. Those revenues represent more than half of all revenues. The point there is that Microsoft is incredibly well positioned as AI takes off. Yes, the company is seeing some softness in relation to demand for its AI CoPilot product. Bears that focus on that fact are missing the larger narrative which is that Microsoft is growing by leaps and bounds due to AI.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) stock has fallen by $5 to $167 over the prior week. There\u2019s good news and bad news there. I would suggest that investors pay attention to the good news and remain bullish because Chevron is one of the best positioned Dow stocks in April.\n\nThe bad news for Chevron is that there\u2019s currently a bit of a fear and trepidation in the markets about the economy. If the economy tanks, the result is lower oil consumption as overall activity slows. Thus, oil prices fall and producers including Chevron fall in tandem.\n\nThe good news is that oil prices continue to be strong on turmoil in the Middle East. I believe that that will be the more important story for Chevron and other energy firms moving forward. Frankly, I don\u2019t think the economy is in much trouble currently. I do think that there is a lot of geopolitical turmoil, however.\n\nIt\u2019s evident in the fact that energy sector returns have essentially mirrored tech returns thus far in 2024. Chevron is the best Dow stock by which to capture those gains moving forward.\n\nDow Stocks: Coca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola Consolidated sign outside of their building. COKE Stock.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is always one of the first defensive stocks to consider when fear is on the rise.\n\nInvestors turn to Consumer Packaged Goods firms and other shares that tend to benefit from steady demand across a variety of macroeconomic environments in such times.\n\nIt seems that fear is rising as we head toward the end of April. That creates an opportunity for Coca-Cola stock and investors. Search the term \u2018all weather stocks\u2019 or something\u00a0 similar and Coca-Cola is almost certain to come up. I\u2019m probably beating a dead horse here but it\u2019s shares have a very long history of thriving in the best and worst of times. The point is that if current fear materializes into something more serious, Coca-Cola is well positioned.\n\nThe other positive regarding Coca-Cola is that Wall Street believes there\u2019s roughly an additional $8 of upside beyond its current $58 price. Look to Dow stocks for defensive strength and to KO stock for\u00a0strength within that strength.\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NYSE:HON) is another defensive Dow stock that looks particularly well positioned at the moment. I say that because I think investors are likely to pivot into defensive positions, especially those that provide income.\n\nHoneywell is an excellent choice in that regard. The company recently announced its 14th dividend increase since 2010. During that time frame the income provided has increased from $1.21 to $4.32 at present.\n\nHoneywell is an industrial company and that continues to beat earnings expectations in what many have characterized as a difficult economy. The company also tends to guide conservatively, thus having the potential to outperform.\n\nOverall, it has a unique combination of steady industrial sector performance and income. It also has a strong connection to artificial intelligence. Honeywell builds robotics that have the potential to replace factory floor workers. The company is applying AI to those machines and has a real shot at creating highly valuable use cases for manufacturing oriented firms.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD)\u00a0management is positioning the company for a period of rapid growth. I believe that\u2019s very important to MCD stock at the moment.\u00a0Growth investors are looking to artificial intelligence to capture perceived growth in the near to midterm.\n\nWhile I have no problem with that logic I also think that those same investors should look at McDonald\u2019s. The company is entering its fastest period of growth in its history. However, that growth is not predicated on AI making it much less risky.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s plans to open 50,000 restaurants by 2027. That equates to roughly a 23% increase over its current restaurant count. It\u2019s clear that McDonald\u2019s will grow rapidly over the coming few years.\n\nMeanwhile, McDonald\u2019s is also aiming to take market share from competitors including Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) that sell high margin beverages. If McDonald\u2019s can successfully scale its CosMc\u2019s business growth will be turbocharged. There\u2019s a lot to like about McDonald\u2019s in April as defensiveness rises and even more to like in the midterm as its growth ramps up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. McDonald's (MCD) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.71 a share seven days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 30, 2024.\n\nMcDonald's' Earnings ESP sits at 0.09%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.71 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70.\n\nMCD is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Dollar General (DG).\n\nDollar General, which is readying to report earnings on June 6, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.60 a share, and DG is 44 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nFor Dollar General, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 is 1.88%.\n\nMCD and DG's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Renowned for their steadiness, blue-chip stocks are favored by investors seeking stability. I certainly include myself in this group. Companies with blue-chip status tend to weather market volatility well, and boast enduring growth track records. This makes these companies valuable portfolio assets for longer-term investors who don\u2019t want to try to trade around headline news.\n\nThe sort of set-it-and-forget-it model is one I\u2019ve tried to build over time. These three companies are among my top picks in this regard.\n\nNo matter what happens with inflation, monetary policy, and other macro factors, these companies should continue to perform well in any environment. Here\u2019s why I think these three blue-chip stocks are worth putting in any portfolio with a time horizon of a decade or longer right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett, the so-called Oracle of Ohama, is one of the most closely-watched investors by many stock analysts and business people alike. This is largely due to Buffett\u2019s long-term mindset and investing strategy. That\u2019s not going to change anytime soon, and his company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) will continue to remain in high demand for this reason alone.\n\nOf course, with the nonagenarian getting older by the year, a succession strategy has been put in place, with the company in very solid hands. Buffett has built a world-class team around him, with other investors who share his long-term outlook that can carry the torch after his passing. Last year\u2019s unfortunate passing of his long-term business partner Charlie Munger certainly caught many by surprise, but that\u2019s the reality investors are facing with this company right now.\n\nIn 2010, Berkshire issued stock for BNSF acquisition, a rare dilution event. However, the company has continued to buy back billions of stock each year, with about $9 billion repurchased last year. More repurchases are expected, and that\u2019s core to the reason why many investors hold this stock long-term.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway stands out as a secure haven for investors during market turbulence. It remains resilient with diversified interests spanning railroads, restaurants, insurers, and retailers and a substantial $167.6 billion cash reserve. Additionally, its Class B stock surged 24% over the past year. In Q1, Buffett signaled confidence in BRK-B\u2019s value as it has been consistently repurchasing stocks.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s obvious the company has enduring value, and investors should take note of this. Compared to other so-called blue-chip stocks, Berkshire Hathaway is among the most defensive long-term conglomerates worth holding, particularly for those worried about a potential market crash on the horizon.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough global challenges remain, among companies in the fast food sector, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) continues to be the stalwart most investors look to for stability. MCD stock has been among the most resilient companies in the market, particularly during previous crises. And with a long-term track record like few companies on the S&P 500, there\u2019s a reason why investors continue to hold this stock in their portfolios.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s growth profile has been hit somewhat by inflation in recent years. The company\u2019s ability to keep prices low has been limited, leading many to suggest other players in the fast food space could make up market share. To a certain degree, this is true.\n\nAll of McDonald\u2019s franchisees still pay their franchise fees, rent, and royalties, and this has become a stream of passive yet strong income for the company. This is what sets McDonald\u2019s apart from its rivals. Franchisees must commit to 20-year rental agreements, making this revenue stream resilient and potentially advantageous. Typically, franchisees opt to renew contracts, highlighting the reliability of real estate income for McDonald\u2019s. Last year, McDonald\u2019s rent revenue spiked a 9% increase, evidencing consistent growth.\n\nWith a 48-year track record of dividend increases, it\u2019s no wonder MCD stock is a must-have blue chip stock for substantial gains. Moreover, analysts predict a positive outlook for the company over the next two years. I think this stock\u2019s upside could be even better than what the analysts suggest, if the company is able to really focus on its pricing and menu strategy moving forward.\n\nPepsi (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) commands a solid position in the consumer-packaged goods sector, offering its iconic cola and diverse snack lineup. Despite market challenges, PEP stock has declined only 14% from its 2023 peak. And at current levels, I think this stock presents a soliddefensive play with a dividend yield hovering around 3%.\n\nTrading at 27-times trailing earnings, its recent downgrade by Argus has raised growth concerns amidst industry pressures. However, investments in automation promise long-term margin improvements for Pepsi.\n\nThe company\u2019s North America business include distinct beverage, snacking, and food businesses, yet international markets combine these under regional categories. Notably, net revenue surged in Latin America by 68%, Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand by 39%, and Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by 34%.\n\nEfficiencies in international markets have boosted PepsiCo\u2019s profits. Operating profit from the aforementioned regions surged from $2.2 billion in 2020 to nearly $3.8 billion in 2023. With continued efficient scaling, PepsiCo could surpass earnings expectations. Coupled with its high-yield dividend, investors are likely to continue to enjoy market-beating returns for some time to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) five-year earnings growth trails the 9.4% YoY shareholder returns",
        "content": "When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) share price is up 39% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 5.5% in the last year.\n\nSince it's been a strong week for McDonald's shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, McDonald's managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.0% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 7% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of McDonald's, it has a TSR of 56% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in McDonald's had a tough year, with a total loss of 3.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 21%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for McDonald's that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "With the VIX indicator moving to a six-month high, investors may want to consider gradually pivoting toward defensive stocks. To be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting hitting the panic button. However, it makes sense to respond to a potentially significant dynamic.\n\nBesides the rising VIX \u2013 otherwise known as the fear index \u2013 the benchmark S&P 500fell below the 5,000 level. As Lawrence G. McMillan, president of MacMillan Analysis mentioned, this breach \u201cchanges the investment picture to a large extent.\u201d Further, the expert warned that the downside move officially ended the firm\u2019s bullish position.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t about panicking but rather being prudent. Below are a few solid ideas for defensive stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWendy\u2019s (WEN) a Wendy's (WEN stock) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA fast-food specialist, Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) operates a quick-service restaurant in the U.S. and internationally. Per its public profile, the company is involved in the operation, development and franchising of its brand. While it\u2019s not as popular globally as say McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), Wendy\u2019s provides a delectable alternative to the major labels.\n\nFundamentally, the company should benefit from the cheap pick-me-up narrative. Yes, during economic hardships, people whittle down their personal budgets to the necessities. However, it\u2019s practically impossible to be so draconian. Sometimes, you just need a quick bite to eat and Wendy\u2019s is able to provide just that.\n\nThough its financial performance isn\u2019t exactly blowing the doors down, it generally beats its bottom-line targets. Last year, outside of a poor fourth-quarter print, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.57%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts project earnings per share of 99 cents on sales of $2.26 billion. That\u2019s a modest but credible improvement over last year\u2019s 97 cent EPS on revenue of $2.18 billion. Thus, it\u2019s one of the defensive stocks to buy.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a grocery store giant, Kroger (NYSE:KR) inherently commands permanent relevance. After all, people need to eat. So, in that sense, KR easily makes the rounds as one of the defensive stocks to buy. However, on a specific note, Kroger benefits from the trade-down effect. Should inflation continue to stubbornly stymie American households, they\u2019ll likely cut down on discretionary expenditures.\n\nNow, part of discretionary spending marries with the essentials, such as going to restaurants for the aforementioned nutritional sustenance. However, going out to eat at pricey establishments is an easy item to axe from the budget. That money can be directed to Kroger, which helps the defensive stocks argument.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the most attractive aspects of the company\u2019s business is consistently solid financial performances. In the past four quarters, its average positive earnings surprise clocked in at nearly 8%. Therefore, I have difficulty buying the current year projections calling for declines in both earnings and sales.\n\nInstead, I believe the high-side revenue target of $152.74 billion \u2013 up from last year\u2019s $150.04 billion \u2013 is more than credible based on the trade-down effect.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of discretionary spending, not every idea in the ecosystem is an unviable one. For defensive stocks to consider, I\u2019d take a look at TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). As part of the apparel space, TJX certainly carries a elements of discretionary retail. It specializes in name-brand apparel but via an off-price business model. That\u2019s an important distinction.\n\nBuying name-brand fashion exclusively if you don\u2019t have your other financial obligations squared away is a surefire way to live paycheck to paycheck. However, should inflation continue to dog the economy, more mass layoffs could be on the horizon. In that case, upgrading the wardrobe for job interviews and other related matters would likely be a must. Here, you want to make your first impressions count.\n\nFor me, TJX is a buy because of its financial consistency. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise landed at 7.58%. By the end of the current fiscal year, earnings could reach $4.08 per share on revenue of $56.23 billion. That\u2019s a decent improvement over last year\u2019s result of earnings of $3.86 on sales of $54.22 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Rock-Solid Dividend Stocks to Shower You With Reliable Income",
        "content": "In a market cycle where the spotlight shines on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies among other growth-centric concepts, targeting dividend stocks is inherently a conservative venture. Turns out, that might be the most prudent plan given the circumstances.\n\nFundamentally, geopolitical concerns have unsettled Wall Street. Tensions in the Middle East have resulted in two nations attacking each other. Fears now focus on global oil supplies and potential disruptions. That\u2019s not including what\u2019s happening in Europe and a potential regional response to the armed conflict.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, a hot jobs market and soaring energy prices have resulted in stubbornly elevated inflation. And that means the Federal Reserve might delay interest rate cuts or perhaps even hike them. It\u2019s an awkward situation, to say the least. Below are reliable dividend stocks to help you sleep easier at night.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food stalwart McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) makes a strong case for trustworthy dividend stocks thanks to filling everyday needs. Yes, technically speaking, the Golden Arches aligns with the broader discretionary retail space. However, in our hectic world, people rarely have time to always cook at home. Sometimes, you need a quick bite to eat or to treat yourself to junk food on your \u201ccheat\u201d days.\n\nFor passive income, McDonald\u2019s offers a forward yield of 2.46%. What\u2019s notable here is that the company commands a track record of 48 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, the payout ratio is reasonable at 49.48%. Thus, it\u2019s one of the dividend stocks that will help investors get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts are seeking earnings per share of $12.40 on revenue of $26.86 billion. That\u2019s a solid improvement over last year\u2019s results of $11.94 EPS on sales of $25.49 billion. Combined with a moderate buy rating and a consensus price target of $323.30, MCD presents a great choice amid the troubles.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nAnother strong player for dividend stocks to buy, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) sells itself under the circumstances. As a manufacturer of various home and personal care products, P&G is a boring enterprise. However, boring tends to mean permanently relevant. What helps the company is generational awareness. Consumers may have a tendency of buying products with which they are most familiar.\n\nLet\u2019s talk passive income. Right now, P&G offers a forward yield of 2.55%. It\u2019s not the most generous yield but it runs above the consumer staple sector\u2019s average of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio isn\u2019t bad at 57.94%. However, the kicker for me is the track record. With 68 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, it\u2019s a dividend king.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate EPS to reach $6.45. That\u2019s a sizable move from last year\u2019s result of $5.90. Also, revenue could land at $84.7 billion, up 3.3% from last year\u2019s print of $82.01 billion. Further, fiscal 2025\u2019s top line could rise to $87.88 billion.\n\nAnalysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $169.60 price target.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA big-box retailer, Target (NYSE:TGT) may face pressure amid the broader economic anxieties. However, as far as its direct peers are concerned, the only consumer base that features a higher average income is the one undergirding Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Of course, Target has the benefit of scooping up transactions from everyone because it\u2019s not a membership-only store.\n\nRight now, Target offers a forward dividend yield of 2.61%. Again, it\u2019s not outstandingly high. However, it does beat the underlying consumer staples sector. What\u2019s noteworthy is that the payout ratio is quite low at 41.77%. This provides confidence for yield sustainability. Also, the company enjoys a track record of 53 years of payout increases.\n\nFor the current fiscal year (2025), circumstances are a bit tricky, Experts anticipate EPS to hit $9.40, above last year\u2019s result of $8.94. That\u2019s the good news. However, forecasted revenue is only $107.19 billion, slightly below parity against fiscal 2024\u2019s print.\n\nStill, the following year could see sales rise to $111.18 billion. Notably, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $183.62 average price target.\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a candidate for boring dividend stocks, it might not get more boring than Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM). That said, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that IRM was one of the few securities that moved higher during Friday\u2019s downturn. Fundamentally, that may be due to the underlying business. Iron Mountain specializes in holistic document and asset security \u2013 both the physical and digital kinds.\n\nAt a time of great uncertainty and nefarious activity, Iron Mountain looks awfully intriguing. It also happens to be one of the top dividend stocks, offering a forward yield of 3.46%. Now, the payout ratio is very elevated, no doubt. However, keep in mind that IRM is structured as a real estate investment trust. REITs tend to run hotter-than-average payout ratios.\n\nAnother enticing factor is that experts are optimistic about the financials. For fiscal 2024, they\u2019re targeting EPS of $1.96, above last year\u2019s print of $1.82. On the top line, sales could land at $6.09 billion. That\u2019s up 11.1% from 2023\u2019s haul of $5.48 billion. That\u2019s not bad for a boring entity.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nLet\u2019s keep the boring theme going with IBM (NYSE:IBM). A legacy tech giant, IBM has long lagged its innovation peers. However, it started to gain positive momentum in recent sessions. Since the start of the year, shares have gained more than 12% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, they\u2019ve enjoyed a nearly 44% boost.\n\nWhat I like about the company known as \u201cBig Blue\u201d is that it\u2019s an unheralded player in artificial intelligence. While many other enterprises get the AI spotlight, IBM has been working diligently on machine learning and other innovations. Oh yeah \u2013 it also pays a forward yield of 3.66%. Further, the company enjoys 28 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like a one-off situation either. Experts anticipate EPS to reach $10.08, a solid improvement over last year\u2019s print of $9.62. As for the top line, they\u2019re seeking revenue of $63.61 billion, up 2.8% from 2023\u2019s haul of $61.86 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s boring but it\u2019s relevant \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes it one of the dividend stocks to buy.\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother enterprise structured as a REIT, Prologis (NYSE:PLD) bills itself as the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. As of the end of last year, the company owned or had investments in ventures, properties and development projects that span approximately 1.2 billion square feet. Its facilities cover a diverse base of approximately 6,700 customers.\n\nBecause of its status as a large REIT, Prologis doesn\u2019t disappoint in the passive income department. It offers a forward yield of 3.71%. Now, the payout ratio is high. However, REITs again often run this metric to what would otherwise be considered nosebleed levels. Also, the company enjoys 11 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate EPS to land at $2.47. Admittedly, that\u2019s lower than last year\u2019s result of $3.29. However, they\u2019re also projecting sales of $7.74 billion, up 13.5% from last year\u2019s tally of $6.82 billion. Next year, revenue may rise to $8.47 billion.\n\nPrologis also enjoys a consensus strong buy view with a $146.29 average price target. Thus, it\u2019s one of the dividend stocks with significant growth potential.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI\u2019ll end this list of dividend stocks with another REIT, Realty Income (NYSE:O). Arguably the most popular REIT, Realty offers tremendous fundamental relevance. Its properties cover multiple consumer needs such as convenience stores, pharmacies and home improvement retailers, among other categories. Unless you anticipate such businesses going out of business, O stock should be a reasonably safe wager.\n\nOf course, beyond the relevance, Realty truly comes alive thanks to its passive income. Presently, it features a forward yield of 5.81%. Also, the company enjoys a track record of 32 years of consecutive dividend increases. Significantly, Realty pays out on a monthly basis, thus aligning with the schedule of everyday life.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts believe EPS could hit $1.53. That\u2019s a big boost from last year\u2019s print of $1.26. On the top line, they\u2019re looking for sales of $4.94 billion, up 21% from last year\u2019s haul of $4.08 billion. And the following year could bring revenue of $5.33 billion.\n\nRealty carries a moderate buy rating with a $58.75 average price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? McDonald's (MCD), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this world's biggest hamburger chain has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.66%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, McDonald's was expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share, but it reported $2.95 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.98%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3 per share, while it actually produced $3.19 per share, a surprise of 6.33%.\n\nFor McDonald's, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nMcDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 30, 2024.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Earnings season is a time when many companies redeem themselves. It doesn\u2019t take much for a beaten down stock to turnaround. A strong quarterly print and upbeat guidance can lead to a big reversal higher in a share price. The stock of United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) just rose 17% in a single day after the carrier issued better-than-expected financial results and offered a bullish outlook to Wall Street. The post-earnings bump pushed UAL stock into positive territory for the year.\n\nSo, whose next? Which beaten down stocks are also likely to move sharply higher when they report first quarter 2024 financial results in the coming weeks? There are plenty of candidates given that many well-known and popular names have seen their share price slide lower since the start of the year while the broader market rallied between January and March. Forget the noise: buy these three unfairly punished stocks before earnings euphoria hits.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) fell more than 20% and logged their worst one-day performance ever after the company\u2019s last earnings print. Analysts seemed to agree that the selloff was an overreaction and remain bullish on PANW stock. The company could be in for a bounce back quarter after it reports 2024 first quarter results on May 28. Year to date, the stock is down 2%, which is uncharacteristic. Through five years, PANW stock is up 245%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its most recent financial results. The problem was with the guidance. The company lowered its full-year guidance for both revenue and billings, sending investors heading for the hills. Management linked the lowered guidance to a shift in strategy, wanting to accelerate growth in artificial intelligence (AI) products. They also said that markets misinterpreted the guidance that was provided. Look for a big clarification during the next earnings print.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt seems strange that shares of the Golden Arches are in decline. But the stock of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has fallen nearly 10% this year and is down 7% over the last 12 months. The share price drop comes despite McDonald\u2019s posting consistently strong financial results, raising its dividend, and undertaking an ambitious growth strategy. Most recently, McDonald\u2019s announced a partnership with Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) that will see its doughnuts sold at McDonald\u2019s restaurants across the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Krispy Kreme deal comes as McDonald\u2019s diversifies its menu amid a big growth push. Last December, management announced plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. The company is also launching a new spin-off brand called \u201cCosMc\u2019s\u201d that\u2019s aimed at teens and twentysomethings. Look for MCD stock to pop if McDonald\u2019s earnings on April 30 show the strategies are bolstering sales and profits.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike\u2019s (NYSE:NKE) stock has been unfairly punished and is likely to rise with improved earnings and as the Summer Olympics in Paris, France approach. This is the conclusion of analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which recently upgraded NKE stock to a \u201cbuy\u201d rating from \u201cneutral\u201d previously and increased their price target on the shares to $113 from $110. Bank of America said in its upgrade that earnings estimates for the sneaker maker \u201cfinally look achievable.\u201d\n\nAnalysts also cited an upcoming catalyst with the Paris Olympics. Nike makes the uniforms for Team USA. NKE stock has been terrible for several years now. So far in 2024, the company\u2019s share price is down 11%. Its 12-month performance is negative 25%. Problems have included bloated inventories and slowing sales in China. Watch for the company to show progress in those troubled areas when it next reports earnings on June 25. Any positive signs are likely to send NKE stock higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Budget-Friendly Retail Plays Due for a Tax Refund Spending Boost",
        "content": "At the beginning of 2024, retail stocks has a bright outlook. Consumer spending was holding up, the rate of inflation was easing, and there were expectations of an interest-rate cut.\n\nThat three-legged stool looks more unstable. The latest reading on inflation showed an uptick that is likely to follow oil prices higher, and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is making it clear that investors should not count on rate cuts anytime soon.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not altogether crazy to invest in retail stocks. As the latest retail spending numbers showed, consumer spending is holding up. With late-filing consumers in line to receive their tax refunds in coming weeks, spending will remain strong.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat means some retailers will be in line to report solid earnings. And many of these stocks are offering good value for investors.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you have to focus on defensive stocks such as consumer staples. But you still want to focus on retail stocks with strong demand, growing earnings, and an e-commerce presence. Here are seven budget-friendly stocks to consider.\n\nBath & Body Works (BBWI) A Bath & Bodyworks storefront\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBath & Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) is a well-known specialty retailer of home fragrance, body care, and soaps and sanitizer products.\n\nThe company has a loyal customer base which is reflected in a base of approximately 37 million \u201cloyalty\u201d customers that accounted for about 80% of the company\u2019s sales in 2023.\n\nBy almost any meaningful measure: free cash flow, operating margin, net margin, and earnings per share, Bath & Body Works had a solid year in 2023. But the stock is down 5.7% in the month following its fourth quarter and full-year earnings report.\n\nThat\u2019s because the company forecast slightly lower guidance for 2024. And that guidance was given when the company was expecting near-term interest rate cuts.\n\nHowever, at 13x forward earnings, BBWI stock is undervalued compared to the composite retail average of around 29x.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting a potential 14% upside in the stock price. And if analysts are correct about the 12.7% increase in earnings, investors may also be in line for a dividend increase.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) was one of the heavily beaten-down retail stocks in 2023.\n\nHowever, with the stock off to a 16% gain through mid-April, the stock is now up about 2% in the last 12 months. And there appears to be room for the stock to move higher.\n\nNot all was rosy in the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings report. Year-over-year comparable store sales were down. The same was true for digital sales. But when it came to the metric that matters the most, earnings, the company reported a 58% YOY increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s true that the company offered cautious guidance. But that\u2019s true for all retailers. TGT stock is attractively valued at 17.5x earnings.\n\nPlus those earnings, even on the low end of the company\u2019s guidance easily support an increase to the company\u2019s dividend. That would make it 54 consecutive years of increases for Target.\n\nFoot Locker (FL)\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nFoot Locker (NYSE:FL) is in a continued downtrend that\u2019s been going on for over two years. FL stock is down 46% in the last 12 months and 29% in 2024.\n\nThe latest reason for investors to sour on the retailer was weaker than expected guidance.\n\nHowever, the latest dip in FL stock may be a case of price discovery. That\u2019s because there have been a handful of analyst upgrades since the company reported earnings in March.\n\nOpinions are mixed, but the stock has a consensus price target that points to about 15% share price growth.\n\nA key reason for this change in sentiment came from Nike (NYSE:NKE) which accounts for about 65% of Foot Locker\u2019s sales. Nike has been moving to a direct-to-consumer model, but in the company\u2019s last earnings report, it\u2019s now saying it\u2019s taking a closer look at its wholesaler strategy.\n\nFoot Locker is also making a pivot to digital and cited an approximately 10% growth in YOY digital sales. And the company expects that number to grow by approximately 25% by 2026.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has been showing up in my social media feeds for the past few months. Some say the prices are too high, others say it\u2019s still a value. Those familiar with the business model know that it depends on where you live.\n\nThe company is mostly franchisee-owned, and those franchises are free to set their own prices. The point being, how you perceive MCD stock may have a lot to do with how you perceive its value.\n\nNot that pricing isn\u2019t an issue. The company acknowledges as much. However, the company\u2019s digital game, which it was working on before 2020, is on point, and a way for cash-strapped consumers to get instant daily deals.\n\nAnother consistent knock on MCD stock is that growth is behind it. But it should be noted that the company beat revenue and earnings estimates in every quarter in 2023.\n\nThe stock is up 38% in the last five years. Not eye-watering growth, but when you add in the dividend, a significant total return for investors.\n\nDollar General (DG) Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, midday\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDollar stores were among the worst-performing retail stocks in 2023. And Dollar General (NYSE:DG) was no exception.\n\nThis reflects the effect that inflation has on the low-income consumers that are a core base of the dollar store model.\n\nBut after a double beat on earnings in March, investors are starting to see the value of DG stock. It\u2019s true that higher-for-longer interest rates are a headwind. But as the company\u2019s earnings report shows, investors may be too negative.\n\nOne reason that I\u2019ve mentioned before is the company\u2019s strategy regarding store location. The company ensures it\u2019s located in rural areas and other spots not easily serviced by big-box retailers.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Dollar General isn\u2019t leaning into digital. The company has ramped up its digital presence with MyDG which gives consumers access to online-only coupons. In 2023, the company reported $381.3 million in digital sales. This was comparable to 2020, which shows that the pivot is going well.\n\nIn times of ongoing market volatility, you should be looking for undervalued stocks that are best in class. DG stock checks that box.\n\nTractor Supply Company (TSCO) A Tractor Supply Co. Store\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a rural lifestyle retailer with over 2,200 stores in 49 states.\n\nThe company has been delivering mixed revenue and earnings results over the last year. TSCO stock is up 139% over the last five years. However, it\u2019s only up about 1% in the last 12 months and that\u2019s because of the 15% rally in 2024.\n\nBut this is a time to remember why you want to own a quality dividend stock. In February, the company raised its dividend for the fifteenth consecutive year. It\u2019s been growing the dividend at around a 40% average over the last three years, but still has a sustainable payout ratio of around 48%.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to like Tractor Supply Company as an undervalued retail stock. But the price action on TSCO stock shows that the stock recently broke above a level of resistance at $248.\n\nAfter a pullback, that price is now being tested as a line of support. A bullish earnings report in late April may be the fuel that the stock needs to take the next leg higher.\n\nLovesac (LOVE) lovesac storefront\n\nSource: BCFC / Shutterstock.com\n\nLovesac (NASDAQ:LOVE) rounds out this list of budget-friendly retail stocks. This is no value stock. Lovesact is a young company that is still in the expansion phase.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, it gave mixed results, but one shining star was expanding margins. That had been a problem for the company.\n\nOne time doesn\u2019t make a pattern. But it should allow investors to focus on other positive developments such as a 15% increase in store count, positive cash flow that almost doubled between 2022 and 2023. That highlights the company\u2019s inventory reduction that puts Lovesac in a good position as it waits for a more favorable monetary environment.\n\nShort interest of over 30% is concerning. But institutional investors own 92% of the stock\u2019s float and the overwhelming sentiment is bullish. That means investors with some appetite for speculation could see a small position slingshot higher if the company continues to deliver strong earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in MCD.

        "title": "McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Knows How To Allocate Capital",
        "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So, when we ran our eye over McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for McDonald's, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$12b \u00f7 (US$56b - US$6.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 9.6%.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for McDonald's .\n\nSo How Is McDonald's' ROCE Trending?\n\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like McDonald's. The company has consistently earned 24% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 65% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn short, we'd argue McDonald's has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 54% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nOne more thing to note, we've identified  2 warning signs  with McDonald's and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to underperform the S&P 500 in 2024. This gives investors a great opportunity for cheap dow stocks to buy.\n\nThe market index tracks 30 blue-chip American companies, offering exposure to some of the most impactful businesses across various sectors. While the index might not be synonymous with rapid, explosive growth, many dow stocks present compelling long term investment opportunities. As investors navigate the challenges of the U.S. stock market in 2024, several down components exhibit signs of significant upside.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the best dow stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a behemoth in the healthcare sector. The company\u2019s two healthcare divisions, UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health, deliver a powerful combination for long term growth.\n\nAs the largest health insurer in the United States, UnitedHealth Group has demonstrated consistent growth and resilience. They have navigated challenging macroeconomic environments and regulatory headwinds extremely well. The company\u2019s diversified revenue portfolio, including health insurance, pharmacy benefit management and healthcare services, has helped them outperform their peers.\n\nMoreover, their monstrous FCF generation and consistent EPS growth should not be ignored. UNH stock delivered record earnings results in FY23, with EPS hitting a record $25.12 per share. Despite a $1.6 billion hit projected from cyber attacks this year, UNH has maintained its adjusted net earnings outlook of $27.50 to $28 per share. This makes UnitedHealth Group one of the best Dow stocks to buy now.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a global icon in the fast-food industry, set to dominate the retail segment over the next decade. They boast a widespread presence and brand recognition that few can rival.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has been heavily scrutinized in the last few years, as major fast-food chains raised prices on the back of inflation. While this has been a tough pill to swallow for some, consumers are still willing to pay the price. The company has been investing significantly in digital innovation, embracing digital ordering and expanding its loyalty rewards program.\n\nIn FY23, McDonald\u2019s grew its comparable sales by 9% YOY, with systemwide sales from loyalty members over $20 billion. Profitability increased significantly from the previous year, and the company set its sights on 8,176 net new restaurants by 2027. They are undergoing rapid transformation and leveraging Google Cloud for their robust loyalty rewards program, which continues to see strong double-digit growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a leading name in global investment banking and asset management. The company\u2019s diversified business model offers a degree of stability, characterized by their strong cash flows and diversified business model.\n\nGoldman Sachs has a reputation for attracting top talent, and its strategic initiatives often set industry standards. The company dealt with a much tougher macroeconomic environment in 2023, largely driven by a slowdown in deal flow and higher interest rates. However, their asset and wealth management division saw continued strength. Management\u2019s execution of strategic priorities has worked well, driving diversified growth in their latest Q1 FY24 results.\n\nAssets under supervision increased by $36 billion during the quarter to a record $2.85 trillion. Revenue increased 16% YOY to $14.21 billion, with EPS up more than 30% YOY as markets continue to recover from uncertainties; GS\u2019s strategic initiatives make it among the top Dow stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Only Have $100? 3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "It used to be you had to have money to make money on Wall Street. And few people actually owned stocks. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers, fewer than two families in 10 owned stocks as recently as 1962. However, 60 years later the same survey found as many as 58% of all families owned stocks.\n\nThere has been a great democratization of investing over those six decades. From the advent of the first discount broker Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to deep discount traders like E-Trade and TD Ameritrade, the cost of making an investment has been going down. And Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) forced the industry to virtually give up transaction fees. Now you can buy and sell stocks at no cost!\n\nEssentially all the barriers previously erected to keep investing as the playground of the rich have been torn down. That means you can find stocks to buy with $100 and begin your journey to creating a comfortable retirement today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo if you only have a C-note to your name, and you don\u2019t need that money to pay bills or for an emergency, then the following three stocks should be no-brainer stocks to buy this month.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, semiconductor stock Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) won\u2019t intuitively seem a dead simple stock you should be buying with your $100. After all, shares trade for over $1,338 each. Even if you purchased fractional shares of AVGO stock, which is just a sliver of a whole share (it is totally possible and definitely worth doing), you\u2019re not getting much for your money, right?\n\nWrong! You have to look at the quality of the company and not the price of a share. That\u2019s why penny stocks are such a terrible idea. These are usually awful companies with little prospects for growth. But their cheap price makes them seem like such a deal. Unfortunately, you\u2019re more likely to lose whatever money you put into them rather than make a killing. That is exactly why Broadcom is an excellent choice.\n\nThe chip stock for mobile communication companies has seen its fortunes grow with the proliferation of smartphones. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a major source of revenue, accounting for 20% of the total. But the mobile market has a boom-bust cyclicality to it and Broadcom wants to smooth out those peaks and valleys. It has more recently steered its efforts towards software, and following the acquisition of VMWare last November, the chipmaker expects half of its revenue to come from this segment.\n\nBroadcom stock also pays a dividend that has increased for 14 consecutive years. It has grown the payout at a 36% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 10 years. Because you will enjoy capital appreciation buying this stock as well as get paid for owning it, Broadcom is the first no-brainer stock to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee slinger Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is the next stock you should be buying with your $100. At $86 a share it is trading close to its 52-week low of $84 a stub. It\u2019s a great price for this excellent company.\n\nStarbucks stock is down in the dumps because of pressures on its international business. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market with over 6,800 locations and the country\u2019s slowing economy has weighed on performance. Similarly, its presence in the Middle East, though dramatically smaller in scope, is bearing the brunt of protests over the war between Israel and Palestinians. It also sees tougher competition here at home from Dunkin, Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) and McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD).\n\nStill, Starbucks enjoys growing sales and profits. In its fiscal first quarter, revenue rose 8% to a record $9.4 billion as comparable sales increased 5% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 20%. Analysts forecast the java shop will grow its profits at 15% annually for the next five years.\n\nSBUX stock also pays a dividend that yields 2.6% annually and it has been growing the payout at a rate of over 8% a year for 13 years. This is another no-brainer buy this month at this deeply discounted level.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock to buy without much thinking is Visa (NYSE:V), the No. 1 payments processor. It has some 4.3 billion Visa cards in circulation and generated $14.5 trillion in total payments and cash volume for the full fiscal year. Visa also enjoys immense profitability.\n\nBecause the payments processor merely lends it brand to credit issuers, Visa\u2019s gross profit margins are 98%. Operating margins are an impressive 57% while net margins are only slightly lower at 50%. It makes the company a cash-generating machine.\n\nVisa chooses to use a lot of that cash to return value to shareholders. Last October it announced it would be buying back $25 billion worth of stock, double the $12 billion it repurchased last year.\n\nThe payments company also pays a dividend that yields less than 1% annually. Yet it has been raising the payout at a torrid pace, hiking the dividend at almost 15% a year for the last five years. It just raised it 16% last year. Visa stock is a no-brainer stock to own now and for a lifetime.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Steady Income, Steady Growth: 7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Blue-chip dividend stocks have always been relevant. While they\u2019re not the most exciting investments, they provide a steady hand during market uncertainty. This attribute has just become even more critical.\n\nWith an already tense situation in the geopolitical realm boiling over, investors will likely seek reassurances. It doesn\u2019t get much better than established stalwarts that pay consistent and/or reliable passive income. On this note, below are top blue-chip dividend stocks to consider.\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn aerospace and defense contractor, RTX (NYSE:RTX) \u2013 formerly known as Raytheon \u2013 offers several solutions in the military hardware space. It\u2019s a controversial idea in that sense because RTX may rise higher due to tensions in the Middle East. Nevertheless, an attack on a sovereign nation can\u2019t be ignored, which invariably enhances the relevance of RTX stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo be fair, analysts are not exactly bullish on the idea, rating shares a hold with a $96.46 price target. Still, given the recent paradigm shift, this dynamic will likely change. On top of that, the company offers a forward yield of 2.36%. That matches the industrial sector\u2019s average yield. Notably, the payout ratio sits at 38.34%, implying strong confidence in terms of yield sustainability.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for earnings per share of $5.39. That\u2019s a decent improvement over last year\u2019s print of $5.06. As for the top line, they\u2019re targeting $78.73 billion, up 5.9% year-over-year. Again, with circumstances changing for the worse in the geopolitical space, RTX ranks among the blue-chip dividend stocks to consider.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top-tier defense contractor, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) also isn\u2019t quite getting the love from analysts. Presently, LMT comes in as a hold consensus with an average price target of $478.07. The high-side target lands at $540. Still, with the dramatic shift in the landscape in the Middle East, Lockheed will probably garner more positive attention.\n\nIn terms of passive income, the defense and aerospace specialist offers a forward yield of 2.8%. What investors will really appreciate is the track record. Over the past 21 years, it has consistently raised its payout. Further, the payout ratio is reasonable at 45.67%, thus providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.\n\nWhile Lockheed isn\u2019t exactly lighting up the board financially, it\u2019s a consistent performer. In fiscal 2023, the company\u2019s positive earnings surprise came out to 5.33%. For the current fiscal year, covering experts are seeking EPS of $26.04, which is lower than last year\u2019s $27.85.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the top line, though, they\u2019re targeting $69.49 billion, up 2.8% above last year\u2019s $67.57 billion. Again, given the paradigm shift, these estimates could easily rise, making LMT one of the blue-chip dividend stocks to watch.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s pivot away from the controversial defense industry and focus on another relevant space: utilities or specifically regulated electric. With NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), investors receive a broad canvas. First, they stand to benefit from the core business of generating and distributing electric power to retail and wholesale customers. Second, NextEra consistently champions renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nWith any tension in the Middle East comes concerns about the stability of global oil supply chains. So, if the Russian invasion of Ukraine hasn\u2019t taught us anything yet, then certainly Iran\u2019s strike against Israel will. If we continue to depend on fossil fuels, we are vulnerable to volatile, unpredictable geopolitical flashpoints.\n\nRight now, NextEra offers a forward yield of 3.27%, which is a bit lower than the sector average yield of 3.75%. However, the company commands 30 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nTo be upfront, the risk factor is that for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate a 1.3% decline in revenue. However, with the shifting sands, I suspect that analysts will boost their assessments. Thus, NEE is one of the blue-chip dividend stocks to buy.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, I though that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and its ilk sold themselves prior to the Middle East flashpoint. One upside catalyst that has nothing to do with warfare is the impressive U.S. jobs market. With the economy continuing to generate more nonfarm payrolls, the conclusion is rather straightforward: more dollars are chasing after fewer goods. That\u2019s inflationary and that\u2019s cynically good for oil.\n\nHowever, with tensions boiling over in many parts of the world, XOM sells itself as one of the best blue-chip dividend stocks to buy. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $125.31. I\u2019m almost certain this print will rise much higher in the coming months. As for the passive income, Exxon carries a forward yield of 3.16%. While that\u2019s lower than the energy sector\u2019s 4.24% average yield, the oil giant also has increased its payout across 41 years.\n\nIn full disclosure, covering experts right now anticipate declines in fiscal 2024\u2019s earnings and growth projections. However, with the geopolitical shift, the most optimistic forecast of $11.08 EPS on sales of $384.24 billion is probably reasonable.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a stalwart in the grocery supermarket business, Kroger (NYSE:KR) makes a great case for blue-chip dividend stocks. No, it\u2019s not the most exciting place to be as an investor, let\u2019s not kid ourselves. However, it\u2019s likely that should tensions erupt into a protracted conflict in the Middle East, oil supplies will get disrupted. If that happens, it\u2019s not just companies like Exxon Mobil that will benefit from higher profitability potential.\n\nRather, I\u2019m looking at Kroger as a downwind beneficiary. Why? Because if oil prices skyrocket, that means practically everything else will rise in price. After all, your morning cereal probably didn\u2019t arrive at your local Kroger store on a solar-powered truck. And because KR stock represents an indelible investment, people have no choice but to pay up.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. For the current fiscal year, analysts project EPS to reach $4.42 on sales of $148.73 billion. Both stats are down against last year\u2019s results. However, the high-side estimate of $4.49 EPS on revenue of $152.74 billion is likely in the cards.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nEven though the state of humanity is rather depressing at the moment, this framework may surprisingly help fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). We can talk all day about being financially prudent. However, we all need a culinary pick-me-up. The Golden Arches provide just that. Also, it\u2019s a great source for coffee and breakfast on the go, particularly for workers who have to return to the office.\n\nAs a powerhouse on Wall Street, McDonald\u2019s is also a great place for passive income. Currently, the company provides a forward yield of 2.5%. That\u2019s a decent bit above the consumer discretionary industry\u2019s average yield of 1.89%. Better yet, the company enjoys a history of 48 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. If you\u2019re looking for reliable blue-chip dividend stocks, this is it.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS of $12.43. That\u2019s a decent bump up from last year\u2019s print of $11.94. Also, they\u2019re anticipating a top-line print of $26.88 billion or 5.4% above 2023\u2019s result of $25.49 billion. For fiscal 2025, sales are projected to hit $28.5 billion, with the high-side estimate landing at $29.33 billion.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical behemoth, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) presents a compelling case for blue-chip dividend stocks to buy. As I\u2019ve mentioned many times before, AbbVie bought out Allergan. With the acquisition, the pharma now controls the Botox anti-wrinkle treatment. Because social media focuses so much on the superficial and because none of us are getting any younger, ABBV stock could be a huge hit.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a cynical talking point but that\u2019s the world we live in I\u2019m afraid. As for the passive income, the company is the most generous one on this list. It offers a forward yield of 3.82%, well above the healthcare industry\u2019s average yield of 1.58%. Even better, the company features 52 years of consecutive dividend increases.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $181.47 average price target. For the current fiscal year, the experts project EPS of $11.20 on sales of $54.64 billion. To be fair, these are modest gains from last year\u2019s EPS of $11.11 on revenue of $54.32 billion.\n\nStill, if you\u2019re looking for a steady anchor to ride out the storm, AbbVie could be it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -4.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which McDonald's falls in, has lost 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.71 per share, indicating a change of +3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.35 points to a change of +3.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.45 indicates a change of +8.9% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, McDonald's is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. The $26.95 billion and $28.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.7% and +6.3%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.41 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.04%. The EPS surprise was +4.98%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Not-So-Happy Meal: $20 Wages Has Burger Joints In This State All Heated\n\nCalifornia fast-food employees started earning a minimum of $20 an hour in April.\n\nThanks to a new law, which went into effect earlier this month, California chain restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide have to pay their employees more.\n\nFor smaller restaurants, the minimum wage continues to be the statewide bottom of $16 an hour.\n\nThe largest publicly-traded fast-food companies include McDonald\u2019s Corp (NYSE:MCD); Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX); Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC; Wendys Co (NASDAQ:WEN); Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR), which owns Burger King; Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG); Papa John\u2019s International Inc (NASDAQ:PZZA) and Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:JACK).\n\nMany of these stocks have lost value since the law was implemented on April 1.\n\nRead Also: AI Gunning For Fast Food Jobs Next? KFC, Taco Bell Operator Yum Brands Planning ChatGPT-Like Bots To Boost Operations\n\nThe wage hikes were deemed necessary in the Golden State. After all, the cost of living in California is about 38% higher than the national average.\n\nSome fast food companies are considering cutting employee hours and raising menu prices.\n\nIn-N-OutBurger President Lynsi Snyder said in an interview with Today that she \"was sitting in VP meetings going toe-to-toe saying, \u2018We can't raise the prices that much, we can't.\u2019\"\n\nHer company, which owns over 400 restaurants \u2014 primarily in California \u2014 continues to be privately held. Snyder said there are no plans to go public or open up to the franchise model.\n\nIn-N-Out has, however, raised prices in Los Angeles restaurants by about 25 cents per burger. That\u2019s still less than the price hikes other restaurants had to implement.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, one Burger King in Los Angeles raised the price of its Double Texas Whopper by 12% from $15.09 to $16.89.\n\nMany restaurant chains started preparing for wage hikes, even before the law was passed last September. Some companies are exploring automation as a strategy \u2014 a trend that took off in 2017 with self-service ordering kiosks.\n\nInsider reported that some restaurant franchises, including a major Burger King franchise, are ordering new digital order kiosks to replace existing staff.\n\nBurger King management recently pointed out that customers tend to order larger meals whenever interacting with digital self-service screens.\n\nIn October, after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the law, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's third-quarter earnings call he expected the policy to \"certainly be a hit in the short term to franchisee cashflow.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet the secondary effects of the new law could even replicate into further trouble for the fast food segment in the Golden State. A Jack in the Box franchise owner speculated on Sunday in an interview with Business Insider that rising prices for fast food chains could mean a loss in market share to casual diners like Chili\u2019s, owned by Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT) or Applebee\u2019s, a subsidiary of Dine Brands Global Inc (NYSE:DIN).\n\nCasual dining restaurants could, in turn, benefit if they're able to keep running without altering prices.\n\nNow Read: Wendy\u2019s Clarifies \u2018Dynamic Pricing\u2019 Comments After Public Outcry, Elizabeth Warren Criticism\n\nImage from MidJourney AI.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Not-So-Happy Meal: $20 Wages Has Burger Joints In This State All Heated originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 72% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in McDonald's implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have been selling lately\n\nA look at the shareholders of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 72% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of McDonald's, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that McDonald's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.2% and 4.8% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of McDonald's\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that McDonald's Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$407m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in McDonald's. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for McDonald's  you should know about.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Q4 Earnings Roundup: Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) And The Rest Of The Traditional Fast Food Segment\n\nThe end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) and the rest of the traditional fast food stocks fared in Q4.\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nThe 15 traditional fast food stocks we track reported a decent Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 0.6%. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, though the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and traditional fast food stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 1.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWendy's (NASDAQ:WEN)\n\nFounded by Dave Thomas in 1969, Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) is a renowned fast-food chain known for its fresh, never-frozen beef burgers, flavorful menu options, and commitment to quality.\n\nWendy's reported revenues of $540.7 million, flat year on year, falling short of analyst expectations by 1.1%. It was a slower quarter for the company, with underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year and a miss of analysts' revenue estimates.\n\n\"The Wendy's\u00ae system delivered strong sales, profit, and cash flow growth in 2023, all supported by progress on our strategic growth pillars,\" President and Chief Executive Officer Kirk Tanner said. Wendy's Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 3.6% since the results and currently trades at $18.59.\n\nRead our full report on Wendy's here, it's free.\n\nBest Q4: Yum China (NYSE:YUMC)\n\nOne of China\u2019s largest restaurant companies, Yum China (NYSE:YUMC) is an independent entity spun off from Yum! Brands in 2016.\n\nYum China reported revenues of $2.49 billion, up 19.4% year on year, outperforming analyst expectations by 7%. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with revenue outperforming Wall Street's estimates, driven by better-than-expected same store sales and a higher number of locations. Profitability was solid, leading to an EPS beat. Looking ahead, the company reiterated that from 2024 to 2026, system sales and profit profit will grow at high-single-to-double-digit CAGRs, leading to a double-digit CAGR for EPS.\n\nStory continues Yum China Total Revenue\n\nYum China achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The stock is down 0.4% since the results and currently trades at $37.31.\n\nIs now the time to buy Yum China? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nWeakest Q4: Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)\n\nStarted by three friends in Seattle\u2019s historic Pike Place Market, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a globally-renowned coffeehouse chain that offers a wide selection of high-quality coffee, beverages, and food items.\n\nStarbucks reported revenues of $9.43 billion, up 8.2% year on year, falling short of analyst expectations by 2.1%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' revenue and EPS\u00a0estimates.\n\nThe stock is down 9.4% since the results and currently trades at $85.27.\n\nRead our full analysis of Starbucks's results here.\n\nMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD)\n\nArguably one of the most iconic brands in the world, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food behemoth known for its convenience, value, and wide assortment of menu items.\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.41 billion, up 8.1% year on year, falling short of analyst expectations by 0.7%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' gross margin estimates and a narrow beat of analysts' earnings estimates. On the other hand,\u00a0revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations, driven by a same-store sales miss.\n\nThe stock is down 9.7% since the results and currently trades at $268.34.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on McDonald's here, it's free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy McDonald's Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Generally speaking, the restaurant business isn't a great one to be in. It's not a cheap business to get into, the failure rate is relatively high, and running the ones that do survive is a stressful, time-consuming endeavor. Simply owning shares of publicly traded restaurant chains isn't always a less risky or more rewarding approach, either.\n\nThere's one noteworthy exception to this norm, however. That's McDonald's(NYSE: MCD). The 68-year-old company has perfected the art and science of managing thousands of fast-food locales. You can plug into this success at a fair price, and have confidence that your investment will produce good returns in the near and distant future.\n\nThere are numerous reasons you should buy McDonald's stock like there's no tomorrow, but four stand out.\n\n4 reasons McDonald's stock is a great pick\n\nYou know the company. McDonald's is of course the world's biggest restaurant chain, operating 41,822 locations around the world. It wouldn't be unfair to say the company is the epitome of how a fast-food chain should operate. It's also consistently profitable, remaining mostly unfazed even by the early, difficult days of the COVID-19 pandemic. MCD Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhat makes McDonald's stock such a great pick right now, however, isn't an arbitrary gut feeling about the future based on its past. The secret to this company's long-lived success isn't a secret at all. Four crystal-clear factors work in the organization's favor that its competitors often try to imitate but rarely actually duplicate.\n\n1. Its brand name is a draw in and of itself\n\nIf simply seeing McDonald's golden arches or hearing one of its musical jingles induces a craving for a Big Mac, that's not a coincidence. McDonald's has invested a lot of time and a lot of money in effective branding, right down to figuring out that the shades of red and yellow you see on its signage inspire happiness at the same time they increase your heart rate. Indeed, the company's been linking up its logo and colors with its television commercials and jingles for so long now that merely seeing or hearing an ad -- or spotting golden arches from a distance -- gets you thinking about those crispy fries!\n\nStory continues\n\nThe result? McDonald's and its golden arches are (literally) one of the world's most-recognized brand names and logos of all time. This makes it much easier to market the company's service, as the audience is already eagerly receptive to these messages.\n\n2. The business model is ridiculously resilient\n\nYou may think McDonald's core business is selling hamburgers. That's not the case, though. The company is mostly a real estate conglomerate these days. It just so happens that its tenants' core business is selling hamburgers.\n\nMost McDonald's franchisees don't own the building where they're doing business. The parent company does, renting this space out to operators at market rates. Unlike mortgage payments, these rent payments go up over time. While the organization doesn't readily disclose these details, roughly one-third of its total revenue comes from rent. That works out to be around two-thirds of the total its franchisees pay the parent company each and every year. Franchisees are, of course, also required to purchase their supplies from the McDonald's corporation.\n\nAs you can imagine, the franchisor's strong-arm model has been a point of contention with franchisees over the years ... and increasingly so! It just doesn't matter. Because the brand name itself is so powerful, operators of the 95% of its restaurants that are franchised continue paying these steep, rising costs.\n\n3. The dividend is solid, and grows consistently\n\nThese reliable rent and royalty payments translate into reliable cash flow. The company just as reliably turns these into dividends for shareholders. As of the latest look, McDonald's stock is yielding an above-average 2.5%.\n\nIt can afford these dividend payments too. The $6.23 worth of dividends it dished out on a per-share basis last year is just a little over half the per-share earnings of $11.56 it produced during the same 12-month stretch.\n\nPerhaps the more poignant point to draw out about the company's dividend, however, is not only how long it's been reliably paid, but reliably raised. With October's increase in its quarterly payout, McDonald's total annual dividend payments have now been raised for 47 consecutive years. That's one of the stock market's very best dividend pedigrees.\n\n4. McDonald's stock is just plain ol' undervalued\n\nLast but not least, McDonald's stock isn't merely cheap right now. It's undervalued.\n\nIt's a somewhat surprising argument given shares' recent performance. Although not by leaps and bounds, McDonald's shares are up for the past two-, three-, and five-year timeframes, and still within easy reach of the record high made in January of this year. Not bad.\n\nExcept, even with that relatively good performance, this stock remains well below analysts' consensus price target. They're saying shares are worth $325.46 apiece, which is 22% better than the stock's present price. Indeed, the stock's current price is well below the lowest of all its current analyst targets ... most of whom, by the way, rate McDonald's shares at a buy or better.\n\nInvestors as a whole may not be big believers in the company right now. However, there's a reason that the analyst community is sticking with its collective bullish opinion.\n\nYou could certainly do worse\n\nAre there more exciting stocks out there to buy? Sure. There's no double-digit growth in the cards here, and while the dividend is rock-solid, you can find higher-yielding names as well.\n\nFrom a risk-versus-reward perspective, though, there's not a lot not to like about this prospect.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, these four primary reasons to buy McDonald's stock have been the stock's top bullish arguments for years now. They're not likely to change at any point in the near or distant future, making McDonald's the kind of holding you can tuck away for years at a time and not worry about constantly watching.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and McDonald's wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) closed at $267.39 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.46% move from the prior day. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.46%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 1.24%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.63%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had lost 4.65% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.17% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.6% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of McDonald's in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on April 30, 2024. In that report, analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings of $2.71 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 3.04%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $6.18 billion, reflecting a 4.79% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $12.35 per share and a revenue of $26.95 billion, indicating changes of +3.43% and +5.72%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.2% downward. Right now, McDonald's possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of valuation, McDonald's is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.75. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 21.23 of its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that MCD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.91. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As the market closed yesterday, the Retail - Restaurants industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.83.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 99, placing it within the top 40% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups.

        "content": "California is forcing fast food chains to get creative to afford the state's new $20 minimum wage.\n\nOne McDonald's franchise owner, Scott Rodrick, is considering higher menu prices and reduced hours, saying that layoffs are the \"last thing\" he is considering.\n\n\"The last 12 days since this unprecedented law impacted franchisees in California has literally been a whirlwind. Frankly, it feels like an eternity,\" Rodrick said during an appearance on \"Varney & Co.\"\n\nMCDONALD'S CEO SAYS FAST FOOD CHAIN WILL FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY AMID OUTRAGE OVER MENU HIKES McDonald's franchisee owner Scott Rodrick revealed that California's new minimum wage law has placed multiple economic hardships on his restaurants.\n\n\"I realize that my customers' appetite for higher prices is not unlimited. So, when I take price to relieve margin pressure, it has to be done thoughtfully and with a plan. Charging $10 for an Egg McMuffin or $20 for a Big Mac, for me, is a nonstarter,\" he continued.\n\nIn anticipation of the new law, Rodrick lifted his prices 5% to 7% between January and March. However, he says that more economic efforts are necessary.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nRodrick, who owns 18 McDonald's franchises in California, warned that the new law is likely to have an \"unprecedented impact\" on California's franchise business model.\n\n\"Price is a lever that an independent business owner like myself can look at to relieve this extraordinary, unprecedented impact on the franchise business model in California. But there are other things, too. I have to somehow grow revenue and reduce costs in my P&L [profit and loss] to survive,\" he said Friday.\n\n\"This is my family's 50th year in the McDonald's business, and I plan on fighting and surviving for another 50 years, so it'll be a combination of price. It will be a combination of looking at capital expenditures, being judicious about labor efficiencies, and trying to grow my market share,\" Rodrick continued.\n\nPIZZA CHAIN RAISES PRICES IN CALIFORNIA TO OFFSET NEW MINIMUM WAGE LAW\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the law, the McDonald's franchisee owner stressed that laying off employees is the \"very last thing\" he is considering.\n\n\"There's a lot of discussion on that subject on restaurants, closing restaurants, laying people off. Frankly, in my organization, that's the very last thing I'm looking at. I have 800 people, 800 human beings that run my restaurants. That's the last lever that I'm looking at,\" Rodrick explained to FOX Business' Stuart Varney. The Gavin Newsom-approved $20 minimum wage bill went into effect on April 1, and has already placed an \"unprecedented\" economic impact on fast-food franchisee owners, according to Scott Rodrick.\n\nA drastic way fast food franchises have combated the state's new minimum wage law is by moving their business elsewhere, something that has admittedly crossed Rodrick's mind a \"few times.\"\n\n\"Right now, the focus is survival. And a third-generation daughter has just joined the business. So, the question I have to ask her is whether she believes her next 50 years should be in a place like California and grinding it out, or is operating a franchise elsewhere something that would be smarter for her to do?\" he concluded.\n\nOriginal article source:California McDonald's franchisee shares struggle with 'unprecedented' impact of new minimum wage",

With this in mind, here are three restaurant stocks that analysts love right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYum China Holdings (YUMC) A banner for Yum China (YUMC) decorates the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nYum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) is the largest of the three restaurant stocks on this list, with a market capitalization of $15.5 billion. Of the 33 analysts covering its stock, 22 rate it a \u201cbuy,\u201d with a median target price of $55.07, 43% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nYUMC is China\u2019s operator of KFC and Pizza Hut. But unfortunately, the Chinese population hasn\u2019t been dining out as often due to higher inflation in 2023 and a sputtering domestic economy. This has severely reduced Yum China\u2019s same-store sales growth.\n\nAs a result, YUMC shares are down nearly 40% over the past year. YUMC stock trades at one of the lowest points since Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) spun it off in November 2016. As recently as March 2023, it traded well over $60.\n\nThe company reported strong 2023 results in February, including a 21% increase in system-wide sales, 7% same-store sales growth, opening nearly 1,700 new stores and an operating profit of $1.1 billion, 79% higher than a year earlier.\n\nDue to the strong year, it plans to buy back $1.25 billion of its stock in 2024 and increase its quarterly dividend to 16 cents. It also plans to open up to 1,700 stores this year to reach 20,000 by the end of 2026. It finished 2023 with 14,644 in over 2,000 cities.\n\nWith a bright future ahead, YUMC is one of the restaurant stocks that has value right now.\n\nArcos Dorados (ARCO) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nArcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO) is the second-largest of the three restaurant stocks, with a market cap of $2.4 billion. All six analysts covering its stock rate it a \u201cbuy,\u201d with a median target price of $14.30, 27% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust as Yum China focuses on KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in China, Arcos focuses on McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nIt is the region\u2019s largest restaurant chain, with 2,361 locations as of Dec. 31, 2023. The company owns 71% of them, and the rest are franchised. Approximately 48% of its locations are in Brazil, with the remainder split between northern and southern Latin America.\n\nIn 2023, it had $4.33 billion in revenue, up 19.6% from 2022. Its net income was $181.3 million, 29.2% higher than a year earlier.\u00a0It trades at a reasonable 13x its 2023 earnings of 86 cents. McDonald\u2019s trades at 23.3x earnings, almost double.\n\nI recommended ARCO stock in January 2023 at $8.70 a share. It\u2019s up 29% since. It\u2019s still a buy in double digits.\n\nPortillo\u2019s (PTLO) The front of a Portillo's (PTLO) hotdog restaurant in Riverside, California.\n\nSource: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.com\n\nPortillo\u2019s (NASDAQ:PTLO) is the smallest of the three restaurant stocks, with a market capital of $967 million. Seven of the 10 analysts covering its stock rate it a \u201cbuy,\u201d with a median target price of $21.11, 59% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nAll three of the restaurant stocks on this list are down in 2024, with Portillo\u2019s doing the worst, down by 15%. The operator of fast-casual restaurants serving Chicago-style food went public in October 2021 at $20 a share. Its shares currently trade 34% below its initial public offering (IPO) pricing.\n\nWhen it went public, it had 67 locations in nine states. Today, 84 are open in 10 states, up from 72 at the end of 2022. In 2023, it opened locations in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Texas. In 2024, it plans to open at least nine locations.\n\nFor its business in 2024, Portillo\u2019s expects 12-15% restaurant unit growth, same-store sales growth in the low single digits revenue growth in the mid-teens and adjusted EBITDA growth in the low teens.\n\nIn late March, Jefferies analysts cut Portillo\u2019s price target by $3 to $21. However, it maintained its \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock, suggesting that the company will continue to be successful with its expansion plans outside the Chicago area. Skeptics have overstated concerns about the restaurant operator\u2019s financials and business, but I think it\u2019s another value buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "McDonald's Insiders Sell US$8.5m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "content": "Over the past year, many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald's\n\nThe President, Christopher Kempczinski, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$280 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$269. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nIn the last year McDonald's insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsiders At McDonald's Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at McDonald's. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes McDonald's Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. McDonald's insiders own about US$410m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About McDonald's Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold McDonald's shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, McDonald's makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of McDonald's.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Defensive Stocks to Buy Before Stuff Hits the Fan",
        "content": "Popular due to their stability and reliability during market turbulence, blue-chip stocks are a top choice for many investors, myself included. These companies have a proven record of yielding success in any economic climate. Their resilience during market fluctuations, and consistent long-term historical growth trends, make them essential portfolio assets.\u00a0When you combine that with defense to get blue-chip defensive stocks, you have a match made in heaven.\n\nAs debates rage on with respect to future rate cuts and inflation, April presents an opportunity to explore top blue-chip stocks. Despite trailing growth stocks in terms of returns, blue chips offer potential relative bargains. Over the long-term, patience is likely to be rewarded as markets stabilize and investors seek safety in uncertain times.\n\nWhile not infallible, blue chips often outperform, presenting a compelling investment opportunity in any market. Here are three I think are worth exploring right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWall Street can\u2019t seem to get enough of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), especially since it announced excellent Q4 earnings results.\n\nGrowth was seen more in Mexico and Germany, including some other markets that compensate for the weak areas of United States demand. However, Coca-Cola surpassed its revenue forecast of $10.7 billion, achieving $10.8 billion in revenue for this quarter.\n\nThe increase was partly due to higher prices driven by inflation in select markets like Argentina. Despite a projected slowdown to 6-7% organic revenue growth this year, the company anticipates moderating inflationary pricing effects.\n\nIn the quarter, sparkling soft drinks and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar drove a 2% increase in unit case volumes, while sports drinks, coffee, and tea saw decreased demand. However, sales in North America slightly declined by 1% despite improvements in dairy, Coca-Cola, and juice.\n\nMoreover, its financial performance was also significantly driven by strong cost management and innovation. Coca-Cola\u2019s recent report reflected a whopping $10.7 billion net income, which shows over a 12% increase from the previous year.\u00a0You can see why this made our list of the top blue-chip defensive stocks.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett, is a top blue-chip stock to own if you want resilient stocks in your portfolio. The investment firm\u2019s market cap is right around $900 billion, and impressively, Berkshire has surpassed the S&P 500\u2019s returns for three years win a row.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past 60 years, the company\u2019s track record is even more impressive. This is a stock that\u2019s delivered investors annualized returns of around 20% per year, far outpacing the overfall market. As a top recession-resistant blue chip stock, the company focuses on continuous growth. This conglomerate has put together some of the world\u2019s best blue-chip assets into one place. In a sense, this is a stock for investors who want to buy and hold a portfolio for decades to own to replicate the overall market. Forget index funds, there\u2019s Berkshire.\n\nWarren Buffet is confident in Berkshire\u2019s potential, and many seasoned investors back this giant. I think Berkshire\u2019s status as a blue-chip giant will remain in Buffett\u2019s presence or after his passing. The team he has compiled is world-class, and retains his long-term vision.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been a great past few months for fast food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), with the stock dipping 7%. The company has been hit by slowing sales growth amid price hikes that have simply turned many consumers away. That said, McDonald\u2019s has remained highly profitable, with a shareholder-friendly business model that allows investors to benefit from continued growth via royalties and franchise fees.\n\nRecently, the company announced a collaboration with popular coffee and donut chain Krispy Kreme (NYSE:DNUT), which included menu expansion. McDonald\u2019s provides investors with plenty of financial stability, evidenced by the company\u2019s 2.4% dividend yield. For the past 48 years, McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t missed a chance to return capital to shareholders in this way, and I don\u2019t see why that would change.\n\nDennis Geiger, an analyst from UBS, said the fast-food chain giant could capture most market share despite the economic climate. However, the company is experiencing some trouble in international markets, and spending from U.S. consumers, specifically those in the low income bracket, is still high. That said, UBS maintains a strong buy rating for the stock with a 25% forecast increase in revenue.

        "title": "Estimating The Fair Value Of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nMcDonald's' estimated fair value is US$266 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$267 suggests McDonald's is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for MCD is US$326, which is 23% above our fair value estimate\n\nHow far off is McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$8.84b US$9.29b US$10.5b US$11.4b US$12.0b US$12.5b US$13.0b US$13.5b US$13.9b US$14.3b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x9 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.53% Est @ 4.56% Est @ 3.88% Est @ 3.40% Est @ 3.07% Est @ 2.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1%  US$8.2k US$8.0k US$8.3k US$8.3k US$8.1k US$7.9k US$7.5k US$7.2k US$6.9k US$6.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$14b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (8.1%\u2013 2.3%) = US$251b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$251b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$115b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$192b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$267, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.266. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for McDonald's\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "title": "Got $5,000? Here Are 2 Undervalued Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever.",
        "content": "One of the biggest advantages as an individual investor is having a longer investing time frame. If you can think in terms of years or even decades, then you have a great chance to outperform the Wall Street pros, who focus on just the next quarter or the following year.\n\nThat long-term approach boosts your odds of beating the market, but it's crucial to pair this thinking with holding many excellent businesses. And ideally, you can snap up these stocks at a discount compared to peers.\n\nThese discounts are harder to find in a market like this, given the huge rally in the S&P 500 since early 2023. But deals are still out there. Let's look at a few of the most attractive ones as of early April.\n\n1. Walmart\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT) is not an expensive stock. Sure, the retailer is valued at a nearly $500 billion market capitalization, making it easily the biggest player in the industry.\n\nBut it books more than $500 billion in annual revenue. In other words, you can buy Walmart for less than 1 times yearly sales, which is a slight discount compared to Target and a huge discount compared to Costco.\n\nYou're not giving up exposure to growth by owning Walmart stock. The chain last reported a 6% sales bump for the holiday quarter thanks to strong customer traffic in the core U.S. market, big gains in its international business, and soaring demand for its e-commerce segment.\n\n\"Our team delivered a great quarter,\" CEO Doug McMillon said in a late-February statement.\n\nIt's true that Walmart won't thrill shareholders with huge stock price gains since it is such a mature business. But the company has proved it can still outperform expectations while delivering higher cash returns through dividends and stock buybacks. Those factors should support excellent returns for patient investors.\n\n2. McDonald's\n\nIt's suddenly not popular to like McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) stock these days. The fast-food chain is barely in positive territory over the past full year, mainly due to worries about slowing growth. But Mickey D's has been here before.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, the chain is seeing falling customer traffic in its core U.S. market. This slump is arriving at the same time that price increases are ending due to slowing inflation.\n\nAs a result, management said in a conference call with analysts that comparable-store sales growth is likely to decelerate back toward its prior normal rate of around 3% to 4%. For context, McDonald's grew comps at a blazing 9% last year and by 10% in 2022.\n\nThe world's leading fast-food company can do a lot with slower growth, though. Earnings are on pace to jump by double digits this year as operating profit margin moves toward 50% of sales. McDonald's generates impressive cash flow on that sales footprint as well, which means investors can expect to see more dividends and more spending on stock buybacks over the next several years even if growth stays muted.\n\nOf course, the chain isn't resigned to allowing sales trends to stall. Executives are investing aggressively in growth initiatives like menu additions and the popular drive-thru and home-delivery sales channels.\n\nYet the beauty of investing in McDonald's stock is that you're likely to see acceptable returns even if the fast-food industry goes through a sluggish sales period. The leading competitor in this space can keep investors feeling full through a wide range of selling conditions, and that makes this stock a great choice for patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and McDonald's wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) is well positioned to gain market share, according to UBS analyst Dennis Geiger. The fast food chain faces tough economic environments in certain international markets as well as weakening spending from lower-income consumers in the U.S. However, Geiger still sees McDonald's as one of the best-positioned restaurant chains to ride out the storm.\n\nUBS maintained its buy rating on McDonald's stock on Friday while slightly lowering its price target to $335 to reflect these challenges. The new price target still suggests an upside of about 25% over the next 12 months or so.\n\nPrice hikes are starting to cause problems\n\nMcDonald's CFO Ian Borden disclosed last month that lower-income Americans are beginning to adjust their behavior in response to rising prices. More people are choosing to eat at home, forgoing McDonald's despite the chain's focus on appealing to cost-conscious consumers.\n\nWhile UBS's Geiger doesn't deny this trend, he still expects McDonald's sales trajectory to improve as the year goes on. Geiger cites strong value scores for McDonald's in a recent Quick Service Restaurant Survey performed by UBS.\n\nSlowing sales growth\n\nMcDonald's grew comparable sales in 2023, but growth slowed sharply from 2022. In the United States, comparable sales growth of 4.3% last year was down from growth of 10.3% in 2022. In international markets where the company doesn't operate restaurants itself, comparable sales growth was an anemic 0.7%.\n\nIt stands to reason that McDonald's will see even slower growth in 2024 as it grapples with issues both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nIs McDonald's stock a buy?\n\nMcDonald's can thrive in most economic environments thanks to its focus on value, but the stock has been steadily rising for years, pushing up the valuation to lofty levels.\n\nMcDonald's stock trades for 24 times trailing earnings. Given the company's sluggish growth, that valuation looks a bit rich. McDonald's will need to find a way to boost its growth rate this year to keep the stock on track.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and McDonald's wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Why Is Krispy Kreme (DNUT) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of doughnut chain Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) jumped 6.1% in the morning session after Piper Sandler analyst upgraded the stock's rating from Neutral (Hold) to Overweight (Buy) and raised the price target from $14 to $20. The new price target represents a potential 30% upside from where shares traded when the upgrade was announced. The analyst weighed in on the recent McDonald's partnership, which was well received by markets, adding, \"What the MCD partnership does for DNUT is gives management the confidence and ability to significantly increase its donut production capacity investments in the U.S., which it will now be able to do on an accelerated basis\u2026MCD is obviously the catalyst but over a longer period of time this should benefit DNUT with other new and incremental DFD locations as well.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy Krispy Kreme? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nKrispy Kreme's shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 8 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago, when the stock gained 36.5% after the company announced in a press release that it would provide fresh doughnuts daily at McDonald's restaurants nationwide (in the United States). According to the report, the Phased rollout will begin in the second half of 2024, with nationwide availability expected by the end of 2026. This is positive news for Krispy Kreme as the move should accelerate its sales velocity and eventually be accretive to revenue growth given the power of the McDonald's brand.\n\nKrispy Kreme is up 2.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $15.06 per share it is still trading 13.2% below its 52-week high of $17.35 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Krispy Kreme's shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $717.56.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "content": "Reduced interest rates make it easier for firms to buy other companies. That\u2019s because acquiring firms can borrow the money needed to finance mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals much more cheaply when rates are low. With the Federal Reserve indicating earlier this year that it\u2019s poised to cut its benchmark interest rate three times in 2024, rates are likely headed lower. As a result, the pace of M&A activity is likely to rise in the second half of 2024. Indeed, already in the fourth quarter, after the central bank strongly indicated that it was done raising rates, the value of M&A deals jumped 19% versus the same period a year earlier. Also importantly, lower interest rates tend to increase the value of firms that are in acquisition. For investors who want to try to benefit from the coming surge of merger activity and merger valuations, here are three potential takeover targets to consider.\n\nPotential Takeover Targets: Quanta Services (PWR) a photo of a city with a digital grid overhead, showing the wide range of connectivity that comes with 5G. communications stocks\n\nQuanta Services (NYSE:PWR) is a huge beneficiary of both the surge of renewable energy projects in America and the upcoming large increases in the demand for electric power.\n\nThat\u2019s because PWR builds \u201cwind, solar, and hydropower generation facilities, as well as battery storage facilities,\u201d while also creating \u201celectric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn December and January alone, the U.S. added a huge combined total of about 7.5 gigawatts of solar capacity, according to the U.S./Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u00a0(FERC). And \u201cBetween February 2024 and January 2027, FERC expects 85 gigawatts and 24 gigawatts of wind will be added.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, fueled by the proliferation of chip plants, electric vehicles (EVs), and data centers, the deman for electricity will jump in many parts of the country. For example, Virginia power provider Dominion (NYSE:D) expects the demand for its electricity to jump \u201cby 85% over the next 15 years,\u201d. Georgia Power reported that it will require the amount of power generated by \u201cfour new nuclear\u201d plants by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuanta will surely benefit from the strong growth of renewable energy and electricity demand. What\u2019s more, its market capitalization, at nearly $38 billion, is low enough for large companies to buy it. Some include Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Shell (NYSE:SHEL), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) or Honeywell (NYSE:HON) to buy it.\n\nDutch Bros (BROS) A Dutch Bros coffee shop representing BROS Stock.\n\nSource: Alexander Oganezov / Shutterstock.com\n\nDutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) is growing rapidly. Its revenue climbed 26% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. The sales of its \u201csystem same shop(s)\u201d rose 5% year-over-year. Moreover, the brand is extremely popular with Generation Z. 62.7% of whom which gave it \u201ca top score\u201d in a recent poll.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the market capitalization of BROS stock is just $6 billion. This makes it an easy target for large companies. A few include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) or Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR).\n\nStarbucks or Dunkin could make the acquisition in order to eliminate a key rising competitor. Any of the four companies could use their considerable cash to take Dutch Bros overseas. This is likely to unlock huge amounts of profits in the process.\n\nAs a result, BROS is one of the best potential takeover targets to buy at this point.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Champhei\n\nViking (NASDAQ:VKTX) has developed an injectable weight-loss drug that appears to be very potent. A \u201cmidstage trial\u201d of its offering indicated that it generated more weight reduction than Eli Lilly\u2019s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound. It is projected to become one of the most lucrative treatments for any condition ever.\n\nAnd Viking is not too large, as it was changing hands at a market capitalization of $8.8 billion as of the end of last quarter. Consequently, a large drug maker could acquire it fairly easily.\n\nAs a result, there has been some speculation that the firm could be bought. Indeed, I think one of many large drug companies that don\u2019t have their own late-stage weight-loss treatment, such as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), could buy VKTX.\n\nAfter all, according to one source, the weight-loss drug market is expected to surge from $1.9 billion in 2022 to $82.8 billion \u201cby 2032.\u201d That would represent a gigantic compound annual growth rate of 45.7%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in VKTX.

        "content": "If you\u2019re searching for cheap blue-chip stocks to buy, look no further. Blue-chip stocks continue to lag the performance of growth stocks. Although it is currently at an all-time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprised of 30 blue-chip names, is up only 4% this year compared to an 11% gain in the technology-laden Nasdaq index. While some blue-chip stocks are performing strongly, many well-known companies are seeing their share price slide lower and badly lagging the market\u2019s overall performance. The declines, while notable, should be seen as a buying opportunity in many instances.\n\nSome of the stocks that are down this year are struggling with short-term issues that are beyond the company\u2019s control. In time, the situation should resolve itself and the share price should move higher. It\u2019s also good to have blue-chip stocks in one\u2019s portfolio as these securities can be defensive in times when the market drops or the economy falters. Plus, stalwart blue-chip stocks are more likely to pay dividends than fast-growing tech stocks and start-up companies. Buying when prices are down and riding them higher should be the goal of every investor.\n\nHere are seven blue-chip stocks to buy at or near their 52-week low in March.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: McDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nThe Golden Arches is as blue-chip as stocks come. The hamburger and restaurant chain has been a reliable performer for decades, trades at a reasonable 24 times future earnings estimates, and pays a quarterly dividend that yields a strong 2.40%. McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has raised its dividend payment every year since 1976. Yet MCD stock has struggled in recent years. Year-to-date (YTD), the share price is down 6%. Over five years, it is up only 45%.\n\nThe softness in MCD stock is curious given that the company is in the midst of an aggressive growth strategy, with plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. McDonald\u2019s also continues to diversify its menu, recently announcing that it will sell Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) doughnuts at its more than 13,500 restaurants across America.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while news of the Krispy Kreme partnership sent DNUT stock up 30% in one day, it barely moved the needle on MCD stock. Time to buy the dip.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nArguably the best deal in the market right now is the stock of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The consumer electronics giant\u2019s share price is down nearly 10% on the year and not far from its 52-week low. Slowing sales in China and an antirust lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Justice Department have pushed AAPL stock down since the start of the year. Smart investors will treat the decline as a buying opportunity.\n\nDespite the headwinds it faces, Apple continues to keep its business chugging along. In recent weeks, the company announced that it plans to start selling its new Vision Pro augmented reality headset in China. Also, Apple is reportedly in talks to license Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) technology from Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and integrate it into future iPhones.\n\nThe addition of AI sets up iPhone for potentially its biggest upgrade in years and could give the smartphone a whole new competitive advantage.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nA huge buy-the-dip opportunity has opened up with the stock of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) after the company\u2019s latest earnings print. LULU stock fell more than 10% after the retailer issued weak forward guidance and said that its North American sales are slowing. The post-earnings decline has dragged the share price 23% lower year to date. However, this popular athletic apparel maker\u2019s stock is not likely to be down for long.\n\nWhile it is true that Lululemon\u2019s North American sales have decelerated, the company is killing it with its international expansion. For the final quarter of 2023, the company\u2019s international sales grew 54% year-over-year, with sales in the key market of China increasing 78%. Lululemon\u2019s total sales, North America included, were up 16% from a year ago. The strong international growth and overall growth are not reflected in LULU stock.\n\nLululemon also continues to expand beyond its traditional focus on women consumers, moving into men\u2019s wear and launching in February a new line of men\u2019s sneakers. Sneakers and casual footwear, both men\u2019s and women\u2019s, represent a huge new market for Lululemon Athletica.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nCan software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) survive an existential threat posed by AI? That\u2019s the question facing the company as its share price has fallen 13% so far in 2024. ADBE stock began to sink after privately held OpenAI launched a new text-to-video generator that competes against its own creative software products that include Photoshop and Illustrator. The situation hasn\u2019t been helped by Adobe\u2019s latest earnings print.\n\nAdobe offered up forward guidance that disappointed analysts on Wall Street. The company also got dinged for canceling its planned $20 billion acquisition of design software start-up Figma and had to pay a $1 billion termination fee. The guidance and Figma fee overshadowed the fact that Adobe reported strong financial results that beat analyst forecasts. The company also announced a $25 billion stock buyback program.\n\nAdobe is not taking the threat from OpenAI and other competitors lying down. Over the last year, the company has added AI features to many of its software products, including an image editing tool called Firefly.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Hershey (HSY) The entrance to the Hershey factory in downtown Hershey, Pennsylvania. HSY stock.\n\nSource: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe\u2019re heading into the Easter long weekend, and one would assume that this would be a great time to be a shareholder of Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY). After all, Americans spent $3.3 billion on Easter chocolate and candy in 2023, up 8.2% from the previous year. Sadly though, there is not much reason to celebrate the Easter Bunny\u2019s arrival this year. Not with cocoa prices trading at an all-time high and above $10,000 per metric ton for the first time ever.\n\nRecord prices for cocoa is a huge problem for Hershey, which spends more than $1 billion a year on the active ingredient in chocolate. Cocoa prices have risen 40% this year due to global supply constraints. The problem lies in the Ivory Coast of Africa, which is the biggest cocoa producer in the world. The region has been hit by both flooding and hotter-than-usual temperatures that are causing drought conditions and diminishing crop yields.\n\nThe flooding and excessive heat has also led to an outbreak of cacao swollen shoot virus that is harming the cocoa crop. The world\u2019s supply of cocoa is now on course for a third straight annual supply deficit. The worsening problem has HSY stock down 24% over the last 12 months and not far from its 52-week low. But long-term, Hershey remains a solid investment. Here\u2019s hoping cocoa prices move lower before Halloween.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe\u2019re barely through one quarter of the year, and already 2024 has been tough on pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). In early January, the company cut its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by nearly 50%, sending WBA stock plunging. Then, the company was kicked out of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), further hurting its share price.\n\nThe net effect is that WBA stock is down 23% on the year. That brings its 12-month decline to nearly 40%. While things look dark for Walgreens, there are some faint glimmers of light starting to shine on the company and its stock. The company has a new CEO named Tim Wentworth who took the helm in October of last year. He has already undertaken a turnaround plan that included cutting the dividend to strengthen the company\u2019s balance sheet and preserve cash.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens\u2019 most recent earnings beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The strong print was a reversal for Walgreens, which had missed earnings estimates in the two previous quarters. It will take time, but WBA stock could come back.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHow low can Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock go? A lot lower according to analysts who cover the company. Down nearly 30% on the year, TSLA stock is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 index. However, each day seems to bring a new analyst downgrade for the stock. Most recently, analysts at Bernstein lowered their price target on Tesla\u2019s shares to $120 from $150 and reiterated a \u201csell\u201d equivalent rating.\n\nBernstein, and others, are worried about slumping global demand for Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles, especially in China. They\u2019re also seeing weak demand for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 electric vehicle stateside. The piling on has hurt investor sentiment related to TSLA stock and pushed the share price lower. Approaching a 52-week low, and with its market capitalization sliding to $500 billion, its fair to wonder, what\u2019s next for Tesla?\n\nDespite the glum situation, there\u2019s every reason for investors to buy-the-dip in TSLA stock. The company is taking steps to right the ship, including raising prices and offering a free trial of its full self-driving feature. Also, the stock has fallen sharply in the past and always comes roaring back. This time is likely to be no different.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "2 Dividend Stocks to Double Up on Right Now",
        "content": "Dividends can be a tremendously powerful part of your investing strategy. Not only can they give you a continuing source of cash to reinvest, but they also serve as powerful tools to align a company's management's priorities with its shareholders'.\n\nThis alignment comes because many companies offer their leadership some form of stock-based compensation. Thanks to a solid, supported, and generally rising dividend, that leadership has an incentive to hold on to the company's stock for the long haul. After all, the dividend can continue to reward them for their efforts long after they're done directly working for the company.\n\nWith that in mind, smart investors looking for dividends don't just focus on the company's current yield, but also on factors that show a commitment to maintaining and boosting that dividend over time. These two dividend stocks look like they fit that bill well enough to be worth considering as potential investments to double up on right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA business that can do well in tough times\n\nGenuine Parts (NYSE: GPC) is perhaps best known as the company behind the NAPA Auto Parts chain. That's a particularly useful economic niche to be a part of, as auto parts tend to remain in demand during weak economies.\n\nWhen you think about it, that makes a ton of sense. Cars are an expensive purchase. Often, people face a choice between repairing their old car or purchasing a newer-to-them car. When times are tough, folks are more likely to shell out a bit of money to fix their existing car, rather than shell out a whole bunch more money to buy a newer one.\n\nThe ability to do well in tough times is key to Genuine Parts' impressive 68-year streak of consecutive annual dividend increases. The company's 5% dividend hike puts its payment at $1 per share per quarter, giving it a solid yield around 2.6%.\n\nIts dividend consumes only around 41% of the company's earnings. That gives it room to continue its streak of increases, particularly if its operations continue to grow. With analysts expecting its earnings to rise by around 7% annualized over the next five years, Genuine Parts could very well soon find itself in rarefied company with a 70+ year streak of dividend increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nA not-so-secret real estate titan\n\nMcDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is perhaps best known as a fast food burger flipper. Despite that reputation, savvy investors often think of it as a real estate mogul that happens to sell hamburgers.\n\nFrom an investor's perspective, a key feature about real estate is that it often generates steady and predictable cash flows. That is a wonderful trait for a business to have if that company plans to pay its shareholders dividends.\n\nSure enough, McDonald's has been able to increase its dividend for 47 consecutive years, with its most recent increase clocking in at a substantial 10%. Often, when companies prioritize their dividend growth streak, their rate of increases will drop to help protect them against losing the streak due to a bad year.\n\nThat McDonald's is still able to deliver a double-digit increase after nearly a half-century of raises speaks volumes for its strategy. In addition to that potential for continued dividend growth, investors get a solid current yield of around 2.4%. Plus, with its dividend consuming a little more than half of its earnings, McDonald's has room to continue boosting its payout in line with its earnings growth over time.\n\nAnalysts expect McDonald's to be able to increase its earnings by almost 7% annualized over the next five years. That potential growth, combined with McDonald's long-term history of dividend increases and reasonable current payout ratio, gives good reason to believe it will keep its streak of hikes alive.\n\nGet started now\n\nAs awesome as both McDonald's and Genuine Parts' dividend histories and prospects may be, you'll only benefit from them if you own their shares over time. To get a dividend, you need to own a company's stock before its ex-dividend date and hold at least through that date. To really benefit from a rising dividend, you'll need to hold its shares throughout multiple annual increase cycles.\n\nThat long-term reality makes today a great day to consider an investment in one of these two dividend dynamos. While nothing is ever guaranteed in the market, their great combination of strong operations, long-term dividend growth trends, and solid prospects for the future make them certainly worth a second look.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Genuine Parts right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Genuine Parts, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Genuine Parts wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw McDonald's (MCD) ending at $282.02, denoting a +1.22% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.86%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 1.22%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.51%.\n\nThe world's biggest hamburger chain's stock has dropped by 5.15% in the past month, falling short of the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.86% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.84%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of McDonald's will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.71, indicating a 3.04% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $6.18 billion, indicating a 4.79% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.38 per share and revenue of $26.95 billion, which would represent changes of +3.69% and +5.72%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.03% upward. McDonald's currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at its valuation, McDonald's is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 22.5. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 20.05 for its industry.\n\nOne should further note that MCD currently holds a PEG ratio of 3.01. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Retail - Restaurants was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.8 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 86, which puts it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "content": "Starbucks (SBUX) is looking to find its footing amid a sea of rising global competition.\n\nShares of the coffee chain are struggling as the company is being hit on multiple fronts, including a pullback in occasional visits in the US, cautious consumers in China, and increasing investments in coffee from players big and small.\n\nThe ongoing Middle East conflict presents another headwind, which prompted CEO Laxman Narasimhan to share his concerns about misinformation being spread about the company in an internal memo.\n\nYear to date, shares of Starbucks are 3%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 10% gain.\n\nThough the company is facing an uphill climb, Deutsche Bank analyst Lauren Silberman tells Yahoo Finance that the worst is over for the stock. \"We see limited downside and believe the risk and reward is skewed to the upside\" moving forward, said Silberman.\n\nIt'll take time to bring customers back in, but Starbucks can turn things around with product innovation, particularly those geared towards Gen Z and millennial customers, added Silberman.\n\nThat includes the launch of three new beverage flavors this fiscal year, including its first, lavender, on March 7.\n\n\"Some of their early Instagram posts...introducing lavender...was some of the best engagement that I've seen on Starbucks posts in a very long time,\" Silberman said. \"Lavender in itself seems to be a growing trend popular with the younger consumer, \"\n\nIn the US, Starbucks is shifting more of its marketing budget to social media to reach Gen Zs and millennials, which make up approximately 51% of its customer base, per a client note from TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles. Last year, its advertising expenses came in at $508 million globally.\n\nThe company is exploring energy beverages, which can help attract younger drinkers and afternoon visitors, according to Charles. It's working to improve US and China same store sales, but management has projected fiscal Q2 to have soft revenue growth.\n\nStory continues HANGZHOU, CHINA - FEBRUARY 25, 2024 - Photo taken on Feb 25, 2024 shows a nearby Luckin Coffee and Starbucks store in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, gaining share won't be easy in a competitive US market. Upstart drive-thru coffee chain Dutch Bros is already offering energy drinks, which make up roughly 20% to 25% of its total sales, according to Charles' note.\n\nIn February, Dunkin' also launched a new line of iced energy drinks, SPARKD'.\n\nSo far Dutch Bros and Starbucks are not hurting one another, William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia told Yahoo Finance back in January, adding that the overall coffee business typically has \"exceptional\" margins.\n\nThose margins are drawing fast food giants like McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN,) Burger King (QSR), and Taco Bell (YUM), into the breakfast game.\n\nMcDonald's, which launched its first drive-thru beverage and breakfast restaurant CosMc's last December, announced on Tuesday that it's partnering with Krispy Kreme (DNUT) to sell its donuts at all restaurants nationwide by 2026.\n\nSilberman said Starbucks isn't \"meaningfully losing share\" in the growing coffee and beverages category, and there can be room for everyone as the industry continues to expand.\n\nBut the coffee chain is also facing increasing competition in China, where it has announced major growth ambitions.\n\nStarbucks has built up its presence in the country over the past 25 years, opening its first store in Beijing in 1999. Last September, Starbucks announced its 20,000th location outside of North America, and plans to expand to 9,000 stores in China in the next two years.\n\nThe company has also invested in building an ecosystem, announcing the opening of its $220 million China Coffee Innovation Park manufacturing facility last fall.\n\nExecutives at the helm are making the case that the Asian market is a long-term play.\n\n\"China's coffee market is still in its early stages, with huge potential to expand the addressable market,\" Starbucks China CEO Belinda Wong said during Starbucks' 2022 Investor Day. \"Per capita demand for coffee in China will grow further from 12 cups per year to 14 cups by 2025.\"\n\nHowever, local independent coffee shops and discount chains like Beijing-based Luckin' Coffee (LKNCY) present a challenge to Starbucks' plans, particularly as the Chinese economy slows down.\n\n\"The China environment remains promotional, which Starbucks is trying to balance with targeted offers ... while trying to maintain the brand's premium positioning,\" wrote Charles. \"We anticipate intense market share competition to linger in China for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Waylon Cunningham\n\nSAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - Runaway prices at U.S. fast-food joints and restaurants have made people skittish down the income ladder and executives at chains including McDonald's and Wendy\u2019s recently said they worry about losing business from those on the tightest budgets.\n\nRoughly a quarter of low-income consumers, defined as those making less than $50,000 a year, said they were eating less fast food and about half said they were making fewer trips to fast-casual and full-service dining establishments, according to polling in February by Revenue Management Solutions, a consulting firm.\n\nThe rising price of food is contributing to budget-conscious diners cutting back.\n\nWhether consumed at home or in a restaurant, food prices rose 20% from Jan. 2021 to Jan. 2024, the fastest jump on record. A recent census Household Pulse Survey showed half of people earning less than $35,000 a year had difficulty paying everyday expenses, and nearly 80% were moderately or \u201cvery\u201d stressed by recent price increases.\n\nLauren Oxford, a musician who works part time at a bed-and-breakfast in Tennessee, said she used to stop by McDonald's after running errands, treating herself to two double hamburgers, fries and a drink, for less than $5. As prices rose, she switched to smaller hamburgers and stopped getting the drink.\n\nBut after a year in which McDonald's franchisees drove prices up about 10% according to the company's executives, she\u2019s going to McDonald's less in general. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know if I can justify that.\u201d\n\nIn the Fed\u2019s most recent Beige Book compendium of anecdotal reports gathered from business and community contacts around the country, 7 of 12 regional Fed districts reported low-income consumers were changing spending habits in search of bargains, seeking more help from community groups, or struggling to access credit.\n\nAbout one-third of Black American households, and 21% of white American households, earned less than $35,000 in 2022, according to the latest available U.S. census data.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fast-food companies that often promote an image of affordability, low-income consumers are a significant portion of the customer base and a bellwether for longer-term trends. But they are typically the first to cut back spending and the last to come back.\n\nBut now, chains may be less likely to chase customers as hard as they have in the past because even with a drop in traffic, sales have remained consistent supported by increased prices.\n\nFast food companies aren't \"in a hurry to take traffic over profit the way they were a decade ago,\u201d said Mike Lukianoff, CEO of SignalFlare.ai and a veteran consultant in the fast food industry.\n\nFor example back in 2008, Subway introduced its nationwide $5 footlong, which became the poster sandwich for the Great Recession. That spurred rivals to introduce extreme value deals for budget-conscious customers, such as \u201c$5 Fill-Up Boxes\" at Yum! Brands KFC.\n\nIn 2016, McDonald\u2019s, after a prolonged slump in sales, introduced a bundle deal it called \u201cMcPick 2\u201d, allowing customers to choose 2 items, like a McDouble, for $2. Within months, Wendy\u2019s offered a four for $4 deal. Burger King offered five for $4. Pizza Hut had a $5 \u201cflavor menu.\u201d\n\nAPP-DRIVEN DISCOUNTS\n\nNow, instead of across-the-board menu slashes and broad discounts, industry analysts say chains are being more selective, aiming them at specific demographics or limiting them to specific meal times or channels, such as its app or only through delivery.\n\nMcDonald's executives told investors in February that it would rely on its existing \"value menu\" to appeal to low-income consumers who might be tempted to eat packaged food at home instead. CFO Ian Borden said affordability is core to the brand, and the company would continue \"evolving\" its value offerings.\n\n\u201cThe battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors, referring to people making less than $45,000.\n\nWendy\u2019s recently introduced a limited-time $1 burger \u2014 available only through its app. Its CFO Gunther Plosch told investors in February that among lower-income customers, their traffic is down but their share with the general market is unchanged.\n\nFor major fast-food companies, loyalty apps are the go-to strategy among major brands to increase retention and the average amount of money spent. The upside for chains, David Henkes, senior principal with Technomic said, is that they capture more transaction data and demographic data for the consumer, \u201cwhich is a trade-off many are happy to do.\u201d\n\nFor example, McDonald's frequently offers in-app discounts, such as 20% off an order or free delivery with a large enough order.\n\nDomino\u2019s halved the minimum purchase price to get points in its loyalty program, to $5 from $10, its CEO told investors at a conference in January. It also reduced the number of purchases needed to get a free pizza to as few as two from six. \u201cAnd so essentially, for this lower-income consumer, we\u2019ve made the brand more accessible,\u201d CEO Russell Weiner said.\n\nTo be sure, not every chain is seeing weakness among low-income customers. At Taco Bell, which sells a single taco for $1.40 at many of its stores in San Antonio, locations in low-income markets did better than other locations, Yum! CEO David Gibbs told investors in February.\n\nMcDonald's still holds its appeal for Andreas Garay, a retail worker eating at a McDonald's in westside San Antonio. He said he plans to keep his coffee-and-Big-Mac habit-- even if prices continue going up.\n\n(Reporting by Waylon Cunningham in San Antonio and Howard Schneider in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Anna Driver)",

The upside for chains, David Henkes, senior principal with Technomic said, is that they capture more transaction data and demographic data for the consumer, \u201cwhich is a trade-off many are happy to do.\u201d\n\nFor example, McDonald's frequently offers in-app discounts, such as 20% off an order or free delivery with a large enough order.\n\nDomino\u2019s halved the minimum purchase price to get points in its loyalty program, to $5 from $10, its CEO told investors at a conference in January. It also reduced the number of purchases needed to get a free pizza to as few as two from six. \u201cAnd so essentially, for this lower-income consumer, we\u2019ve made the brand more accessible,\u201d CEO Russell Weiner said.\n\nTo be sure, not every chain is seeing weakness among low-income customers. At Taco Bell, which sells a single taco for $1.40 at many of its stores in San Antonio, locations in low-income markets did better than other locations, Yum! CEO David Gibbs told investors in February.\n\nMcDonald's still holds its appeal for Andreas Garay, a retail worker eating at a McDonald's in westside San Antonio. He said he plans to keep his coffee-and-Big-Mac habit-- even if prices continue going up.\n\n(Reporting by Waylon Cunningham in San Antonio and Howard Schneider in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Anna Driver)",

        "content": "The collaboration between Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has sparked a significant rally in DNUT's stock, reversing its year-long downtrend and marking a positive shift in its yearly performance. This partnership will introduce Krispy Kreme donuts to McDonald's U.S. outlets in a phased rollout, aiming for nationwide availability by the end of 2026.\n\nDespite today's surge, DNUT's stock has struggled since its IPO in summer 2021, trading below its initial $17.00 offering price. The company faced challenges from an inflationary economy that increased its costs and pressured consumers to cut back on discretionary spending. However, recent signs of disinflation and the expansion of its McDonald's partnership have reignited investor interest.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with DNUT.\n\nDNUT's strategic move to partner with McDonald's, expanding its reach from about 350 to over 13,000 locations, addresses its primary challenge of accessibility. This expansion not only boosts its U.S. presence but also sets the stage for potential international growth, with plans to enter new markets in Europe and Brazil.\n\nThe partnership leverages DNUT's extensive experience in collaborations, enhancing its distribution network through various outlets. This experience, coupled with the competitive edge it could provide to fast food chains, positions DNUT favorably for future growth opportunities.\n\nThis strategic alliance with McDonald's represents a pivotal turnaround opportunity for DNUT, offering a solution to its accessibility concerns and setting a foundation for sustainable growth amidst ongoing inflationary challenges.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Krispy Kreme and McDonald's are getting together over breakfast.\n\nThe doughnut chain and the fast food giant unveiled plans Tuesday to offer Krispy Kreme products at McDonald's locations across the United States. A phased rollout is expected to start later this year, the companies said, with availability at participating restaurants nationwide expected by the end of 2026.\n\nMcDonald's didn't specify how many of its 13,500 U.S. locations \u2014 95% of which are franchised \u2014 would be participating in the deal. But in a prepared statement, Krispy Kreme President and CEO Josh Charlesworth said the partnership would give customers \u201cunprecedented daily access\u201d to the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company's glazed, filled and frosted treats.\n\n\u201cBy making Kreme Krispy accessible to fans nationwide through this partnership, we expect to more than double our points of access by the end of 2026,\" Charlesworth said.\n\nTariq Hassan, chief marketing and customer experience officer for McDonald\u2019s USA, said the deal marked a chance to \u201cunlock new business opportunities\u201d in the Chicago-based chain's breakfast category and the sweet items it sells throughout the day.\n\nMcDonald's plans to make three Krispy Kreme doughnut varieties \u2014 original glazed, chocolate iced with sprinkles and a filled chocolate iced \u2014 available individually and in boxes of six until daily supplies last.\n\nThe partnership is hardly the first bringing major restaurant chains and popular food brands together. Taco Bell, for example, has long boasted Doritos-flavored tacos while Wendy's brought a Cinnabon \u201cpull-apart\u201d treat to its menu last month.\n\nKrispy Kreme has teamed up with other businesses before. Krispy Kreme doughnuts are sold at Walmart, Kroger and other grocery chains along with the chain\u2019s own stores. In total, the company says it operates in 35 countries with more than 14,000 \u201cfresh points of access\u201d through its own shops, retail partnerships and e-commerce business.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the McDonald's deal, shares of Krispy Kreme soared nearly 30% by late morning Tuesday. McDonald's stock was up about 0.08%.\n\nIn an email to The Associated Press, a Krispy Kreme spokesperson said the company would not be disclosing any financial details about the deal, which is exclusive to the U.S. through 2026. McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) captured the spotlight recently with its announcement that it will issue a 50-for-1 stock split. The makes sense given that the stock recently achieved a new all-time high of over $3,000 a share (before slipping back slightly).\n\nHere's why Chipotle and two other leading restaurant, food, and beverage dividend stocks are all worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChipotle is an excellent story with room to run\n\nChipotle has growth -- plain and simple. Its top line continues to grow at a breakneck pace, but it's the company's margins that have really improved in recent years. Chipotle now has roughly the same operating margin as Starbucks but is growing at a far faster rate.\n\nHowever, unlike other restaurant chains, Chipotle doesn't pay a dividend because it prefers to pour profits back into the business. This bold strategy can amplify gains, but it also puts pressure on the investment thesis when there's a slowdown. CMG Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhat's more, Chipotle is a very expensive stock -- especially for its size and industry. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 66. Granted, the forward P/E is a bit lower at about 55.\n\nAnalysts' consensus estimates call for $64.78 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share (pre-split) -- which would imply 21% growth compared to fiscal 2024 expectations of $53.45 per share.\n\nIf Chipotle keeps growing its bottom line by 15% to 20% per year, then its expensive valuation could start to look much more reasonable over time. But there's no denying the stock is priced to perfection and should only be considered by investors who believe in the company's sustained growth and have a multi-year outlook.\n\nMcDonald's has a near-perfect business model\n\nChipotle isn't a terrible buy, but McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) could be even better. For one, investors are getting the chance to buy McDonald's at a 24.5 P/E, a discount to its five-year median P/E of 27.1.\n\nMcDonald's has been raising its dividend at a fairly rapid rate. The current quarterly dividend is $1.67 --\u00a0 roughly double what it was 10 years ago. In October, McDonald's raised its dividend by 10%, which is a sizable increase for a company of its size. The raise puts McDonald's on track to become a Dividend King by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's has an underrated business model. Unlike Chipotle, which owns and operates all its U.S. locations, 95% of McDonald's locations worldwide are franchised. McDonald's owns the real estate and collects rent revenue, royalties, franchise fees, and more. The company's structure makes its brand and the perceived revenue that franchisees can generate over time more important than its short-term performance or even the business cycle. MCD Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nMcDonald's may not have Chipotle's growth, but it's a better investment if you're looking for consistency. The company has an extensive track record of rewarding its shareholders. As mentioned, the dividend has roughly doubled over the last decade, but it's the entire capital return program that really stands out.\n\nOver the last decade, McDonald's has bought back over a quarter of its outstanding shares, which illustrates the effectiveness of its business model and how it rewards shareholders using dividends and buybacks on top of potential capital gains.\n\nIn sum, McDonald's has it all, and is worth buying now.\n\nCoke offers a compelling, reliable yield\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) hasn't bought back shares at nearly the rate as McDonald's. And it doesn't have as good growth prospects as Chipotle or McDonald's. However, what Coke has is stability and the ever-important quality of not overextending itself.\n\nCoke was instrumental in globalizing soda. But today, the company is mature. There's only so much it can do to grow without overspending. To its credit, it has made measured and mostly effective acquisitions. It has also stayed almost entirely within its core competency of nonalcoholic beverages, which is far different from a company like PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, and plenty of other brands across product categories.\n\nWhen the market has a bad year, Coke tends to outperform. But when the market has a great year, Coke usually underperforms. Unsurprisingly, Coke has underperformed because the market has done very well in recent years.\n\nThe ideal way to invest in Coke isn't because you're trying to beat the market, but because you want to limit downside risk and collect passive income. Nothing is guaranteed in the stock market, but Coke is about as close as it gets to predictability. The company has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years.\n\nThe stock yields 3.2% -- which is quite a bit higher than other reliable Dividend Kings. Coke's reliability is one of the reasons why Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway has owned the stock for over 30 years.\n\nSomething for everyone\n\nIt's easy to get enamored with a growth story like Chipotle, especially when the entry point (without fractional shares) becomes lower, thanks to a stock split. However, to have the conviction to hold a stock over time, it's essential to invest in companies you understand and that align with your investment objectives.\n\nChipotle's lack of a dividend and its lofty valuation won't appeal to everyone. If you're more income and value oriented, McDonald's and Coke could be better choices.\n\nBut if you're a balanced investor, then picking up shares of all three stocks is a great way to get a bit of growth, value, and income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "7 Dividend Darlings to Scoop Up Every Time the Market Dips",
        "content": "Dividend investing is one of the prominent ways to build wealth. Whether you are building a retirement portfolio, want to leave a legacy, or are looking to use the dividend income to cover your expenses, the right dividend stocks can make it possible. However, not all dividend stocks are the same. They can provide regular income but you need to ensure this income is consistent. This is why it makes sense to invest in companies that have a record of paying steady dividends. Consistency and stability are the two things you need to watch out for. Let\u2019s take a look at the seven dividend stocks you should buy with every dip.\u00a0With an improvement in the economy, we can expect these companies to offer dividend hikes throughout 2024.\n\nDividend Stocks: Rio Tinto (RIO) Mining cart in a silver, copper, and gold mine representing VOXR Stock.\n\nSource: TTstudio / Shutterstock\n\nIf you are hungry for a high dividend yield, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a great stock to own. With a dividend yield of 5.42%, the company could benefit from the rate cuts. One big reason to own the stock is the solid fundamentals.\u00a0It reported a free cash flow of $ 7.7 billion in 2023.\n\nRio Tinto has a dividend payout ratio of 80%, which is better than several companies today. It has recently announced an investment in the lithium industry. The company will invest\u00a0$350 million in Argentina for a lithium project and this could be a massive opportunity for it to cash in on the hot asset.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt has committed to an annual capital investment of $7 billion between 2024 and 2026 and this will pay off in the long-term. With inflation receding, Rio Tinto will see a drop in operating costs and we could see another dividend hike.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a dividend yield of 1.24%, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) enjoys a strong presence in the tech industry. The company reported impressive financials and beat estimates. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Oracle is set to see higher growth in the coming years. It has a dividend payout ratio of 35% and considering the earnings potential, it can easily increase the payouts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fourth quarter, its cloud services saw a 45% increase in sales to hit $4.1 billion and it has robust guidance for the year. Trading at $129, the stock is up 23% year-to-date (YTD) and increased 46% in the year.\n\nThe company has been around for a long time and is rapidly building new data centers to meet the growing demand. For the current quarter, it is expecting earnings in the range of $1.62 to $1.66 per share. The management is aiming for sales of $65 billion by 2026.\n\nThere is an AI backlog and Oracle is making the most of the momentum. This is one stock that will not only generate passive income but also show capital gains in the next two years. It is a pure-play tech stock with the ability to reward investors significantly.\n\nDividend Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\nA dividend aristocrat, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has raised its dividend payouts for 41 consecutive years. The oil and gas company is a key player in the industry and it will make significant cash flow driven by the oil prices at over $80 a barrel.\n\nThe company did not cut dividends even during the pandemic and enjoys a yield of 3.35%. It has a dividend payout ratio of 41% which shows that the dividend is sustainable and there is scope for an increase. The oil company generated\u00a0$55.4 billion of cash flow in 2023 and distributed $32.4 billion to the shareholders.\n\nIt declared a quarterly dividend of 95 cents per share which looks attractive for XOM stock trading at $113. The stock is up 10% YTD but any dip is worth buying. The elections and electric vehicle adoption could have an impact on the stock but I believe Exxon Mobil is relevant right now and has a long way to go.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the biggest industry players, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) enjoys a strong global presence, pricing power and brand loyalty. The demand for caffeinated beverages is expected to increase as summer approaches and I believe this will help the stock.\n\nMultiple price hikes have impacted the sales but I think the company is done with the hikes and the slowdown in sales could be temporary. PepsiCo has a dividend yield of 2.93% and the stock is trading at $172. The company has increased dividend payouts for 52 consecutive years and this speaks about its commitment to reward shareholders.\n\nThe stock has also grown 42% over the past five years. The management expects to see a\u00a04% rise in organic revenue this year. PepsiCo has a diversified business which shields it from the market movement and is highly relevant in the current environment.\n\nPepsiCo is growing in international markets and is one passive income stock that wouldn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nDividend Stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top healthcare stock, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a dividend yield of 3.06% and has been increasing dividend payouts for more than 50 years. Having spun off the consumer products division, Johnson & Johnson is in a good position to see revenue growth driven by medical devices and innovative medicine.\n\nThe company saw a 7.3% rise in sales in the recent quarter where the pharmaceutical division surged 4.2% while the medical devices segment grew 13.3%. It enjoys stellar cash flow and has enough liquidity to keep rewarding shareholders.\n\nIt is one of the fastest-growing biotech companies with a strong pipeline of drugs and management expects to see annual growth between 5% to 7% between 2025 to 2030. Trading at $155 today, the stock is moving in the range of $145 to $162 and is at a discount right now. This is one stock to load up on whenever the market dips.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nYour favorite burger joint is a dividend-paying company. A dividend aristocrat, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD)\u00a0has hiked dividends consecutively for 49 years and enjoys a yield of 2.36%. Trading at $283 today, the stock is down 4% YTD. It hit $300 in January but has dropped since then.\n\nThe food giant has a global presence and enjoys a competitive advantage in the industry. The company has a franchise business model which helps keep operating costs down and generates steady cash flow. It offers affordable meals which helped it thrive during the inflationary period. Lower prices, implementation of AI and menu innovation can help attract customers and we could see an improvement in sales.\n\nIt saw an\u00a08% YOY rise in net sales and a 3.4% rise in the same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Fundamentally, MCD is a strong company with the ability to rebound from the recent slip. Looking at the company\u2019s history and global presence, the stock looks highly undervalued to me.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) An image of three square ice cubes stacked up, a red Coco-Cola can, and a glass with ice and soda (from left to right) on a teal painted wood table.\n\nSource: FoodAndPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrading at $60 today, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoys a dividend yield of 3.21% and is one of the top companies globally. It has a strong presence in the beverages industry and is diversifying into healthy drinks to meet the changing needs of consumers. A dividend aristocrat, Coca-Cola believes in rewarding shareholders and has increased dividends for over 60 years.\n\nWith Coca-Cola, do not expect any immediate upside because the stock has been moving sideways over the past few months. However, it will bring stability to any portfolio and generate passive income for you. In the recent quarter, it announced a dividend of 49 cents per share. A cultural phenomenon, Coca-Cola has over 200 drink options and caters to every age group.\n\nIt saw a 6% YOY rise in revenue in 2023 and the operating cash flow hit $11.6 billion. The company is well-positioned for growth and could see an improvement in sales during the months of summer. With a dividend payout ratio of 76%, KO stock is one of the best dividend stocks out there.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Q&amp;A: Chipotle CEO dishes on big portion sizes, AI, and top leadership advice",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nJust passing the six-year mark in his run as Chipotle's (CMG) CEO, Brian Niccol is still juggling full plates.\n\nOn his mind: robots that cut, core, and peel avocados; a coming commencement speech at his alma mater; and how many restaurants he's opening in the years ahead.\n\nAll in the day of a CEO who has flown a little under the radar in the press, but not with his investor base. This week, the company announced a 50-for-one stock split, making its shares more accessible as the stock trades around all-time highs.\n\n\"I think Chipotle is going to achieve things that we set out in vision statements and now we're making reality \u2014 so the next few years are going to be a lot of fun,\" Niccol tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nIt's been a fun few decades for Niccol, who got his feet wet at Procter & Gamble (PG)'s branding department in the mid-1990s. Then a recent college graduate, one of his first assignments was working on P&G's Scope Mouthwash account and reportedly breaking new ground by sending an animated kiss via email.\n\nFast-forward, and Niccol was leading marketing at Yum! Brands (YUM) owned Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, where he created Taco Bell's famed \"Live M\u00e1s\" branding. He went on to become its CEO, his last role before accepting the Chipotle gig. Brian Niccol speaks during an interview at the Associated Press in New York. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe soft-spoken fast food veteran started as Chipotle's CEO on March 5, 2018, with two strategic imperatives. First, stabilize a business financially rocked by an E.Coli outbreak. Second, relaunch the brand amid a shift to digital ordering.\n\nThen, another priority as the COVID-19 pandemic hit: Retrain workers and continue to promote from within, long the hallmark of Chipotle.\n\nSince then, Niccol has checked every box and more. He ushered in new menu items such as cauliflower rice and quesadillas, and tested robots that make tortilla chips. He boosted Chipotle's presence to 3,400 locations (including an entry into Canada), up from 2,400 around the time he was hired.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chain could hit 7,000 restaurants or more in the US over the next decade, says Niccol, who's aiming for a record of 285 to 315 new openings in 2024.\n\nChipotle shares have skyrocketed 556% since Niccol was announced as CEO, per Yahoo Finance data, compared to 89% for the S&P 500 and 79% for McDonald's (MCD).\n\nTo further put this into perspective, Apple's (AAPL) stock price is up 275% during that time span, while Amazon (AMZN) has gained about 119%.\n\n\"Chipotle remains a premium brand with strong value and digital capabilities that have positioned Co better than most as evidenced in recent traffic trends,\" Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said in a recent client note.\n\nThe below conversation with Niccol has been condensed for length and clarity.\n\nBrian Sozzi: Through the inflationary period seen in recent years for fast food, people have still seemed to have a love affair with Chipotle the brand. Why?\n\nBrian Niccol: The mission that we have is \"Food with Integrity.\" And what does that mean? Well, it means clean food. It means food that's raised the right way. It means it's food that's cooked and prepared the right way.\n\n[Customers will] talk about how big the portions are with the burritos or the bowls that they build, but when you really boil it down, it is this commitment to Food with Integrity and the [cooking] that actually happens in our restaurants. It's all fresh food done right in front of you, and people are turned on by that, and the fact that we can get it done highly customized and highly fast, it's just meaningful bonus points.\n\nSozzi: It's really just the large portion size, come on.\n\nNiccol: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head, Brian. The customization so that you can get the bowl or the burrito the way you want \u2014 it is hugely valuable. If you want double meat, we'll do that for you. If you want a little extra rice, we'll do that for you. At the end of the day, however you want to eat, you ultimately feel good about what you're putting in your body. And I think that matters a lot to every generation and every income cohort out there.\n\nSozzi: How is AI and new automation technology going to change Chipotle's future? A new JP Morgan report said you were testing cameras that will help measure portion sizes so they are accurate; tell us more.\n\nNiccol: I think there's definitely a future where we can be a lot more accurate in giving people consistent portion sizes, whether it's double guac on the side or in your bowl. And the reality is between vision, technology, and AI, I think we're going to be able to become a lot more accurate, without having to give up any speed in doing it. That's what I'm most excited about.\n\nSozzi: Is this the year where you test new vision technology in restaurants to improve order accuracy?\n\nNiccol: We have not yet, but I'm optimistic that this is the year where we're going to do one or two of these things at least in a restaurant. And the thing that I'm really excited about is even the next generation [of this technology] that we're already working on.\n\nAnd then when you get your crew members involved, you put it under the pressure of hundreds of transactions, you just learn so much. I think even on our Autocado [avocado peeling robots], we're already on like our third or fourth prototype, and now we're like okay, this is ready to go into a restaurant. I'm sure when we put it in the restaurant, we'll learn something that might cause us to iterate one more time.\n\nPart of the process of this too is you've got to be comfortable with failing. Chippy [tortilla chip-making robot] didn't pan out the way we thought it would. Because of Chippy we ended up a lot better on Autocado. I'm committed to being a learning organization.\n\nSozzi: What went wrong with the Chippy robot testing?\n\nNiccol: The biggest challenge was the cleaning of it. It just became way too cumbersome for the team to clean it. We took that learning for Autocado. Much earlier in the design we have to take into account what's going to take for the crew member to clean this thing. The time is nearing where a machine could cut, core and peel avocados at Chipotle restaurants. (Chipotle)\n\nSozzi: The Chipotle lines in the restaurant feel like they are moving faster at long last. Why?\n\nNiccol: [It] is just from getting back to executing on Chipotle standards. We had to really shake off some of the behaviors that were created during the labor shortage in COVID. Where we were dealt really difficult situations that caused them to close the restaurant early or be out of ingredients or be understaffed.\n\nAnd all that stuff now is behind us. We're staffed now and trained for deploying, and the teams have more stability than they've had in the last couple of years.\n\nSozzi: Not many restaurant chains are opening 300 locations this year as you all are. In 10 years, how many Chipotles are open worldwide?\n\nNiccol: Well, we've publicly said we want at least to get to 7,000. I think the good news is as we continue to open restaurants we see no slowing down in new unit economics, which will give us more and more confidence that 7,000 might be too conservative of a number.\n\nAnd I'm just talking about the US. So, Canada is performing well, every region in the United States is performing well, and we're early days in Europe, and we're going to start exploring how this brand can work and travel outside the United States. But it's early days there.\n\nSozzi: Can Chipotle work in China?\n\nNiccol: That's a great question. I don't know the answer to that yet. My instincts tell me yes. But we have a long way to go to prove that out ... The good news is, we've got the US business growing in a really special way that affords us the opportunity to go learn in a lot of different parts of the world.\n\nSozzi: Chipotle continues to place a lot of emphasis on promoting people from within to higher-level positions and offering perks like college assistance to strengthen the culture. How much do you think about culture each day?\n\nNiccol: It's hugely important. People want to be a part of a winning culture, a caring culture, a growing culture. And one of my key jobs is how do I make sure I've got the right leaders that cascade that type of culture.\n\nSozzi: How do you stay sharp as a leader?\n\nNiccol: I'm always trying to figure out what I could learn next. I'm still really curious. I like what I do. So that gets me energized. And it's fun when you're a part of growing something. The idea that we have so much opportunity to grow, and the fact that I still consider myself young, I still have so much I personally think I could impact and grow myself.\n\nSozzi: So where do you see yourself in 10 years? You are still a young guy as you mentioned.\n\nNiccol: It's funny, I've got three kids and my youngest, she's still in middle school. I want obviously Chipotle to achieve everything that we've set out to do. But I also know it's important for me and my wife Jen to see our kids turn into good folks. And, hopefully over the next 10 years, that's what we see happen with our kids. I want to see them turn into brave young adults. And at the same time, I think Chipotle is going to achieve things that we set out in vision statements and now we're making [them] reality. Brian Niccol quote\n\nSozzi: I hear you are giving a commencement speech in May to your alma mater Miami University. What's your message going to be to those graduating?\n\nNiccol: It's funny, I'm working on that right now. People that are committed to getting things done, guess what, they get things done. And then unexpected things happen. Unexpected doors open, unexpected opportunities open. And when you walk through those things with an attitude of I'm going to get it done, things happen.\n\nYou've got to do it with high integrity, you've got to do it with high resilience, because not everything's going to go the way you think. I think we live in one of the best places in the world to take advantage of that. So, I think that's the biggest thing that people need to remember is don't be afraid to be a doer.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Call Me Crazy: I'd Invest in McDonald's Over Nvidia",
        "content": "Graphics-chip maker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) seems like it can do no wrong these days. With its shares soaring past $900 recently, it wouldn't be surprising to see them reach $1,000 soon. This is extraordinary considering shares were trading at less than $50 just five years ago. The semiconductor specialist, which has been benefiting from the boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) as companies race to buy up its advanced AI chips, has become the ultimate Wall Street darling.\n\nNvidia shares undoubtedly deserved a big run-up given the chip-maker's stellar business performance. The tech company's revenue soared 126% year over year in fiscal 2024, fueled by a 217% increase in its data center revenue. But the degree of the stock's astronomical gains merits some skepticism.\n\nTo help illustrate the risks inherent in Nvidia shares today, I'd go as far as to say that even McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) may be a more attractive long-term investment from here. The boring and mature fast-food burger chain's more conservative valuation and predictable business arguably combine to make a superior value proposition for investors compared to Nvidia. While I recognize this may shock or even aggravate some Nvidia bulls, please hear me out. This isn't a pitch for Nvidia shareholders to sell but rather a reminder that not every stock is right for everyone.\n\nValuation risk\n\nOn the surface, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio of 77 seems more than justified by the company's fundamentals. Not only did revenue more than double in fiscal 2024 but earnings per share soared 586%. With growth like this, investors may conclude that the company can easily grow into its stock's valuation.\n\nBut investors have to give some weight to the possibility of AI chip demand slowing in the future and Nvidia's operating profit margin taking a big hit. One main reason for the outsize gains in Nvidia's earnings compared to its revenue was a huge improvement in operating margin. Surging sales led to Nvidia's operating margin increasing from about 34% in fiscal 2023 to approximately 61% in fiscal 2024. While it's encouraging to see the company's operating margin increase, such a large boost in margin means there's a risk of some moderate or even significant reversion for the key profitability metric at some point in the future. If supply and demand for Nvidia's data center products become more balanced over time, for instance, unit sales growth could slow, chip prices could come down, and operating margin could compress all at the same time. There's a risk, therefore, that future circumstances could lead investors to be more hesitant about paying 77 times earnings for the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompare this to McDonald's, with its far more conservative price-to-earnings ratio of 24 and its more consistent operating margins. To its credit, the operating margin at McDonald's has expanded from 42% before COVID to 46% today. But given how much slower and smaller its operating margin expansion has been than Nvidia's, any reversion to the burger chain's pre-COVID operating margin levels would likely occur at a slow and manageable pace (manageable for both management and investors) and would have a much smaller negative impact on profits. McDonald's investors, therefore, would likely have plenty of time to react to the changing environment and they'd probably be compensated by the fast food king's long-standing dividend (currently yielding 2.3%) while they re-evaluate the stock's long-term prospects.\n\nVisibility risk\n\nFurther, most people would likely agree that the pace of disruption and change is much faster in semiconductors than it is in fast food -- particularly when comparing market leaders of both industries. To illustrate, look at the rise and fall of Intel stock, which reflects how the company's once-dominant industry leadership has been easily eroded away by competitors like Nvidia, Broadcom, and others. Long gone are the days of Intel's leadership. Over the last five years, Intel stock has declined 20% and Nvidia shares have risen more than 2,000%.\n\nMeanwhile, McDonald's has easily sustained a leadership position as a global restaurant chain for decades. Not only has its stock increased more than 50% over the past five years while paying meaningful (and growing) quarterly dividends to shareholders the whole time, but the underlying business continues to grow rapidly. Today, its strong growth persists. Gobal comparable restaurant sales rose 9% year over year in 2023 and increased 30% since 2019. The company's scale, customer loyalty, and consistent service across its stores have created a wide and highly predictable \"moat\" for the business that keeps customers coming back and competitors at bay.\n\nIt's safe to say that McDonald's has an easier-to-predict business than Nvidia. The likelihood of a new competitor disrupting the burger chain is much lower than it is for a competition to make inroads on Nvidia's semiconductor leadership. Further, the ramifications of potential negative outcomes, like Nvidia giving up its big lead over competition or slowing sales, could be disastrous for the stock given the risk of significant margin compression and the growth stock's high valuation.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I could be drastically underestimating Nvidia. Indeed, there's probably a high chance I am. However, history in the tech sector (particularly in the semiconductor industry) shows that there is a high level of unpredictability regarding how competitive dynamics can play out over time. For this reason, I firmly believe there's greater visibility into the business at McDonald's than Nvidia -- enough difference that I'd rather bet on McDonald's stock.\n\nSure, I would consider investing in Nvidia at the right price. But that price would have to be very attractive, leaving a meaningful margin of safety in my calculations about the company's potential future. In other words, I'd consider buying Nvidia stock if I believed it traded at a significant discount to my estimate of its fair value. But its current price is far above the levels I'd need to see it trade at before shares seemed to trade with a sufficient margin of safety.\n\nRisk and reward go hand in hand\n\nThis isn't to say that McDonald's stock will outperform Nvidia stock over the long haul. Instead, the point is that risk and reward go hand in hand. I'd argue that the potential reward investors can achieve from McDonald's stock relative to the underlying risk of owning it makes for an overall better value proposition than Nvidia stock's current risk-reward profile.\r\n\r\nOne final point: investors should remember that they don't need to invest in every hot stock. It's OK to sit on the sidelines and not participate in an investment if it seems too risky to them. Every investor is different. I, for example, would rather choose a stock with less valuation risk and more visibility than Nvidia -- even if this means missing out on big potential gains. In the meantime, I'll sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show without judging those who have chosen to invest in Nvidia stock. Many people have higher risk tolerances than me and that's OK.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of French soccer will become sponsored by fast-food big cheese.\n\nMcDonald's signed on to be the title sponsor of the French top-flight from July for the next three seasons.\n\n\u201cThis partnership marks the coming together of two major institutions that are deeply rooted in the daily lives and collective imagination of the French people,\u201d the league said on Thursday.\n\nMcDonald's will be succeeding Uber Eats as the title sponsor of Ligue 1. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nAccording to L\u2019Equipe newspaper, which did not specify its sources, McDonald\u2019s will pay 30 million euros per season ($33 million). The sports outlet said the food delivery service Uber Eats pays about 16 million euros ($17.5 million) per season.\n\n\u201cAt a time when interest in Ligue 1 has never been as strong, with record crowds in the stadiums in particular, welcoming an international brand like McDonald\u2019s to the home of French professional football sends out a very strong signal about the appeal of Ligue 1,\" French league president Vincent Labrune said.\n\nThe new sponsorship is a welcomed boost for the league, which is expected to financially suffer from the departure of its biggest star \u2014 Kylian Mbappe \u2014 at the end of the season. The Paris Saint-Germain forward has announced he will leave PSG, with Real Madrid in pole position to recruit him.\n\nThe French league is in negotiations for the sale of television rights for 2024-29 and Mbappe's moving away is likely to have negative consequences on the outcome of the financial talks.\n\nContrary to popular belief, McDonald\u2019s is a people\u2019s favorite in a nation whose gastronomic meals and table rituals have been inscribed in UNESCO\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nThe American fast-food chain, which started in France in 1979, has more than 1,500 restaurants across the country. It says 78,000 people work for the company in France.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s CEO will become chairman of the company\u2019s board later this spring, the burger chain said Tuesday.\n\nChris Kempczinksi, who was named McDonald\u2019s president and CEO in late 2019, will succeed McDonald\u2019s Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr., who is retiring after 28 years on the Chicago company's board. The transition will happen at the company\u2019s annual meeting, which is expected to be held in May.\n\nHistorically, McDonald\u2019s CEOs have also held the position of chairman. Jim Skinner was McDonald\u2019s vice chairman and CEO from 2004-2012, for example.\n\nBut the company\u2019s subsequent CEOs broke that pattern. Don Thompson served as president and CEO from 2012-2015, while Steve Easterbrook was president and CEO from 2015-2019. Kempczinski took over as president and CEO after Easterbrook was fired for having a non-physical, consensual relationship with an employee.\n\nKempczinski joined McDonald's in 2015 as executive vice president of strategy, business development and innovation. Prior to that, he spent more than 25 years in senior positions at Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and Kraft.\n\n\u201cHaving served alongside Chris, who is now in his fifth year as CEO, I know he is uniquely placed to unify the two roles of CEO and chairman to ensure McDonald\u2019s advances in lockstep with today\u2019s ever-changing business and social landscape,\u201d Hernandez said in a statement.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also announced the nomination of Mike Hsu, the chairman and CEO of Kimberly-Clark Corp., as an independent director on the board.\n\nKempczinski said Hsu is a veteran of the consumer products industry with a global perspective, which will help McDonald\u2019s as it embarks on a period of unprecedented growth. In December, the company announced a plan to open nearly 10,000 McDonald\u2019s restaurants worldwide over the next four years.\n\nMcDonald's also noted that Hsu would help maintain a corporate goal of having 50% or more of its board members represent diverse backgrounds.",

        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) closed at $278.58 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.2% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.63%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.2%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.82%.\n\nThe world's biggest hamburger chain's shares have seen a decrease of 4.41% over the last month, not keeping up with the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.76%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of McDonald's will be of great interest to investors. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.72, showcasing a 3.42% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $6.18 billion, up 4.86% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.38 per share and revenue of $26.96 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.69% and +5.75%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for McDonald's. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.06% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. McDonald's currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of valuation, McDonald's is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 22.55. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 20.9.\n\nInvestors should also note that MCD has a PEG ratio of 3.01 right now. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As the market closed yesterday, the Retail - Restaurants industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.01.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 158, positioning it in the bottom 38% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "title": "Hot Dividend Stocks: The 3 Best Opportunities for Passive Income Investing",
        "content": "As the broader stock rally broadens to some of the more \u201cboring\u201d corners of the market, it\u2019s the higher-yielding dividend plays that could stand to move higher from current levels. Undoubtedly, a broadening out of the rally would benefit some of the investors who\u2019ve rotated (away from the hottest technology companies into less-loved \u201cvalue\u201d stocks) accordingly. Though I\u2019m no fan of rotating from one \u201cflavor\u201d of stock to another based on traits such as share price momentum, I completely understand why value investors would want to do this, especially after last year\u2019s impressive action.\n\nOf course, not all dividend stocks stand to benefit as the American economy looks to head face-first into a soft landing at the hands of the Federal Reserve. Some of the dividend players just seem better equipped to navigate remaining macro headwinds. And in this piece, we\u2019ll look at three such names.\n\nAT&T (T) Image of a person holding their smartphone\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) stock is a prime example of why catching a falling knife is a bad idea. Until now, AT&T has had trouble making money as it has struggled to break out of its multi-year bearish decline.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough the hot rally off last year\u2019s summer lows is encouraging, I wouldn\u2019t treat it as the turning point \u2014 at least not yet. The stock\u2019s long-term trend is still lower. And until it can sustain an upward spike over the coming year, investors could find themselves waiting a long time for the turnaround plan to reflect in the share price.\n\nAt 8.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), the stock is getting absurdly cheap. Then again, when hasn\u2019t AT&T looked cheap in the past few years? Shares of T have still found a way to gravitate lower. As the cost cuts and operational improvement efforts continue, though, T stock\u2019s next move may very well be higher.\n\nWolfe Research\u2019s Peter Supino is a notable bull on AT&T stock, with a $21.00 per-share price target and a newly upgraded Outperform rating. It may not be the best telecom company, noted Supino, but it may \u201cjust might make for the best stock.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nI think he\u2019s right. AT&T looks like a deep-value stock right now. The long-term chart looks nasty, but what\u2019s in front of the firm really matters. For now, there\u2019s a nice 6.51% dividend yield to look forward to.\n\nCVS (CVS) the exterior of a CVS pharmacy store\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nCVS (NYSE:CVS) stock is another company that doesn\u2019t have the prettiest long-term chart. Not after losing around 40% of its value from its 2022 peak to its 2023 trough. With shares inching higher in recent quarters, there is hope for investors seeking deep value (shares of CVS go for 11.9 times trailing price-to-earnings) and a rich dividend yield (3.44% at writing).\n\nThe healthcare services and pharmacy firm is currently in the process of recovering after a brutal year for managed care companies. Undoubtedly, medical care costs have been quite elevated of late. Looking ahead, though, things seem somewhat brighter, with management recently reaffirming its guidance, calling for $12 billion in operating cash flows for 2024.\n\nOnly time will tell if CVS enjoys a U-shaped recovery over the coming year. Regardless, the dividend, low beta (0.5 at writing), and low valuation are enough reasons to hold the name.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock has been retreating again after briefly hitting the $300 per-share milestone. Shares are now down around 7% from their all-time high, with a double top (it kind of looks like the golden arches) technical pattern that may be in the cards.\n\nAs the fast-food firm moves on from a rough quarter that saw sales from certain customers dry up, it will be interesting to see what big changes and surprises it has up its sleeves in the second half. Loyalty, lower prices, higher-quality food and continued menu innovation could be key factors in attracting crowds.\n\nIndeed, McDonald\u2019s pricing has gotten a tad out of hand these days. Some consumers have had enough. While home cooking will always be cheaper than going out to eat or ordering in, it\u2019s evident that McDonald\u2019s needs to reduce prices if it\u2019s to continue to be perceived as a defensive company that can fare well in unfavorable economic times.\n\nAs the company improves its burger buns and takes steps to offer more attractive prices, I think MCD stock has the means to rebound from its latest slip, perhaps in the second half of the year. Until then, the stock\u2019s modest 24.1 times trailing price-to-earnings multiple seems to offer a great value proposition for passive income investors hungry for its 2.39% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of McDonald\u2019s.

        "content": "By Waylon Cunningham\n\nSAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - When McDonald\u2019s first opened for business in the 1940s, its workers stood at physical counters, its burgers and fries were listed on paper menus, and its customers paid cash to its human cashiers.\n\nHow quaint.\n\nToday technology so infuses every aspect of McDonald's business that it would only be a slight exaggeration to call it a tech company that happens to sell burgers.\n\nMcDonald's mobile app; its human-less, order-taking kiosks; its digitized menus that change based on trends, the weather and more; and even its generative AI - together, these enable McDonald\u2019s to eke out additional sales and efficiencies worth billions of dollars to the company, which has 40,000 locations in roughly 100 countries.\n\nYet that same tech can also bring McDonald's to its knees.\n\nOn Friday, system outages plagued McDonald's locations across some of its biggest global markets, including Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom, forcing many stores to temporarily take only cash or shut down entirely. McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t disclosed how widespread the outages were, but on Friday afternoon, 12 hours after the outages were first reported, a franchise in San Antonio, Texas wouldn't accept orders in its app and couldn't accept cash.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said in a statement the outage was caused by an unnamed third-party provider during a \"configuration change\". Asked for comment, McDonald's referred to that statement. McDonald's Japan on Saturday apologized for the inconvenience, saying all its restaurants and its delivery service were operating normally.\n\nThe burger giant did flag that something like this could happen, at least to Wall Street.\n\n\u201cWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems,\u201d company lawyers wrote in its annual Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Feb. 22. \u201cAny failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees\u2019 operations, or our customers\u2019 experiences and perceptions.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEven AI gets a warning in the filing, which states that \"the artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our restaurant operations may not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results.\"\n\nYet Friday's widespread outage is unlikely to bump McDonald\u2019s out of its long-term strategy to deepen its reliance on tech.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s wants more customers to order through digital avenues like its app and kiosks, which already made up a third of its sales in top markets in 2022.\n\nIn December McDonald\u2019s announced a partnership with Google to move restaurant computer systems into the cloud, where the global scale of data will allow McDonald\u2019s generative AI system to \u201cbetter understand the broadest range of patterns and nuances,\u201d resulting in what McDonald's at the time said would be \"hotter, fresher food.\" Generative AI already powers much of the restaurant operations and personalized pitches made from internal profiles of customers.\n\nIt's not just McDonald's. Tech is the strategy du jour of virtually every major fast food chain.\n\nStarbucks in 2019 announced its own internal AI platform, called \u201cDeep Brew,\" which then-CEO Kevin Johnson said would increasingly power its personalized offers, store staffing and inventory management.\n\n\u201cOver the next 10 years, we want to be as good at AI as the tech giants,\u201d Johnson told a retail conference in 2020, according to Retail Dive, a trade publication. Starbucks in 2022 hired a former McDonald's executive to oversee its use of technology.\n\nRisks from this new technology don't just come from system outages.\n\nWendy\u2019s got public backlash after its CEO said during an earnings call in mid-February that the chain would soon use \"dynamic pricing\" on its digital signs - yet another technology that would not have been possible before the age of information.\n\nThe chain later clarified that it did not intend to use digital signs to implement \"surge pricing\" that could let it charge higher prices during busy times. Rather, Wendy's said, its CEO's remarks referred to its plan to offer discounts to patrons during slow parts of the day.\n\n(Reporting by Waylon Cunningham in San Antonio; Additional reporting by Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo; Editing by William Mallard)",

        "title": "Baby formula lawsuit wipes \u00a37bn off FTSE 100 giant",
        "content": "A selection of Enfa products on sale in Manhattan - Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nConsumer goods giant Reckitt has suffered a \u00a37bn share price slump after it lost a US legal case claiming its baby formula contributed to the death of a premature child.\n\nLondon-listed Reckitt\u2019s share price plunged by the most in two decades and to its lowest point in more than a decade after an Illinois jury ruled Reckitt had failed to warn about the risks of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) from its milk-based Enfamil brand products.\n\nNEC is an illness that damages the stomach and tends to affect premature babies. Reckitt\u2019s US subsidiary Mead Johnson Nutrition had been sued by Jasmine Watson, who claimed the baby formula caused the death of her premature baby.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFTSE 100-constituent Reckitt has now been ordered to pay Ms Watson $60m (\u00a347m) after losing the case.\n\nAshley Keller, a lawyer for Ms Watson, said: \u201cThe jury\u2019s finding confirms what Mead Johnson folks already knew \u2013 that its formula dramatically increases the NEC risk \u00a0 \u201cThis is the first verdict in the US, but won\u2019t be the last, unless baby formula makers accept responsibility for their misdeeds.\u201d\n\nNews of the decision sparked a near 20pc plunge in Reckitt\u2019s share price, wiping around \u00a37.3bn ($9.3bn) from its market value.\n\nIt comes amid hundreds of US lawsuits against formula makers over NEC. The Illinois case was the first to go to a jury trial.\n\nShares in Abbott Laboratories, another formula maker facing legal claims, fell almost 5pc. Jurors took less than two hours to decide that Mead Johnson should pay $60m in compensatory damages. Mr Keller said: \u201cWe only asked for $25m, but the jury came back with more than double that.\u201d\n\nMore than 400 suits targeting Mead Johnson and Abbott are consolidated before a federal judge in Chicago for pre-trial information exchanges. The judge hasn\u2019t yet scheduled a trial. Thousands of other suits are pending in state courts, Mr Keller said. \u00a0 Reckitt continues to insist its products are safe and not linked to NEC. It has vowed to appeal the Illinois case.\n\nStory continues\n\nNEC has a fatality rate of as much as 40pc. It is a major cause of death among premature babies, though rarely occurs in full-term babies.\n\nThe disease, which affects intestinal tissues, can be hard to diagnose. According to the NHS, symptoms can include general signs of illness, problems feeding or vomiting, and a swollen and tender abdomen.\n\nWhile it has a high fatality rate, it can be treated with intravenous feeding and antibiotics. In some cases it can require surgery.\n\nReckitt said in a stock market update that it stands by the safety of its products and \u201cstrongly rejects any assertion that any of our products cause NEC\u201d.\n\nThe company added: \u201cIt is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.\n\n\u201cThis case, and others like it, exclusively involve products used under the strict supervision of neonatologists in neonatal intensive care units and provide lifesaving nutrition options for vulnerable premature infants.\n\n\u201cWe are, of course, surprised and deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned.\u201d\n\nReckitt is one of the world\u2019s largest consumer goods companies, pulling in revenues of \u00a314.6bn in 2023. As well as Enfamil, it makes products such as Durex condoms, Cillit Bang cleaning fluid and Gaviscon.\n\nNutrition brands account for about 16pc of its sales, contributing \u00a32.4bn to its turnover last year.\n\nNews of the Illinois jury\u2019s decision marks the latest in a series of blows for the company, which last month revealed a \u00a355m hit to revenues caused by an accounting controversy in the Middle East.\n\nKris Licht, chief executive at Reckitt, said the company had unearthed \u201csome commercial practices that we weren\u2019t particularly pleased with\u201d, leading to the dismissal of a number of employees.\n\nReckitt in January recalled two baby formula products from sale in the UK amid concerns they could contain dangerous bacteria, in an event unrelated to the case in the US.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:06 PM GMT\n\nThat\u2019s all for today...\n\nThanks for joining us on the blog today. We\u2019ll be back on Monday but in the meantime here are a coupe of our latest business and money articles from elsewhere on The Telegraph site:\n\nCity law firm seeks burnout advice following partner\u2019s death Modest earners are now being taxed \u2018as if they are rich\u2019, figures show\n\n05:42 PM GMT\n\nAdobe drops 14pc amid fears of competition from AI rivals\n\nAdobe has dropped 14pc in trading today after it forecast revenue for the current quarter below analysts\u2019 estimates, amid concerns of rising competition from AI-focused startups for its photography, illustration and video software.\n\n\u201cExpectations were perhaps a little higher in terms of what we would guide,\u201d chief executive Shantanu Narayen said during a conference call after the results, according to a Bloomberg report. \u201cBut you know I\u2019m really optimistic about what we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said of the software giant\u2019s AI initiatives.\n\nRevenue will be $5.25bn to $5.3bn (\u00a34.12 to \u00a34.16bn) in the quarter, below the $5.1bn that analysts had forecast.\n\n05:10 PM GMT\n\nStuttering growth could cause Europe to cut rates before America\n\nWall Street\u2019s main stock indexes are down today after a slew of data this week dampened hopes for several rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year.\n\nShares in Paris and Frankfurt ended little changed Friday but rose during the course of the week.\n\nThe shares gained on expectations that Europe\u2019s stuttering growth might enable the ECB to start cutting interest rates this summer, even if the Fed doesn\u2019t.\n\nJack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics, said \u201cthe ECB doesn\u2019t need to wait for the Fed,\u201d and added that the Norwegian and Swiss central banks could cut rates in the coming weeks.\n\nEven though neither country uses the euro, their moves would underscore that European monetary policy doesn\u2019t have to take its cue from the Fed.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, a sharper-than-expected jump in US wholesale prices sent US shares lower on Thursday and those inflation concerns carried over into Friday.\n\n05:01 PM GMT\n\nFTSE 100 closes down\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed down 0.20pc today. The biggest riser was British Airways owner IAG, up 6.18pc, followed by Vodafone, up 5.69pc. The biggest faller was Reckitt Benckiser, down 14.58pc, followed by tobacco giant Imperial Brands, down 2.56pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.14pc. The biggest riser was bus and train company Firstgroup, up 13.41pc, followed by supplier to the oil and gas industry Hunting, up 7.02pc. The biggest faller was Bank of Georgia, down 6.57pc, followed by telecom infrastructure company Helios Towers, down 6.28pc.\n\n04:57 PM GMT\n\nRolls-Royce to add 200 jobs in Derby as engines prove a hit\n\nRolls-Royce is to expand its engine manufacturing capacity in the UK and Germany amid booming demand for overseas\u00a0travel. Matt Oliver reports:\n\nThe British engineering giant on Friday said it would increase its assembly, testing and shop capacity, to meet demand for its large engines and improve maintenance for those already in service.\n\nOver the rest of this decade, the company predicts the number of aircraft using its Trent family of turbofan engines to grow by as much as 9pc annually.\n\nAs a result,\u00a0Rolls\u00a0is investing \u00a355m and hiring 300 frontline workers to boost its operations in Derby and Dahlewitz, in Germany.\n\nAbout half of the investment and two thirds of the jobs will go to Derby, the company said.\n\nIt will be used to expand the number of engines the company\u2019s factory there can deliver per year by 40pc from 2025, while also increasing the number of engines that can undergo maintenance.\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Rolls\u00a0will take advantage of existing engine testing capabilities in Dahlewitz to temporarily meet extra maintenance demands before switching to assemble and test new Trent XWB-84 engines from 2026.\n\nIt comes after the company vowed to invest \u00a31bn in improvements to the Trent engine family.\n\nLast month\u00a0Rolls\u00a0revealed sales of its large aeroplane engines had surged to their highest level in 15 years. A Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine, designed for the Airbus A350, on the assembly line at the factory in Derby, 2016 - Paul Ellis/Reuters\n\n04:45 PM GMT\n\nBP among winners in North East gas-fired power station push\n\nMajor plans for gas-fired power stations that capture carbon took a key step forward today with the award of building contracts worth \u00a34bn.\n\nThe joint-venture scheme, led by British energy giant BP plus France\u2019s TotalEnergies and Norway\u2019s Equinor, forms part of the Government plans for a net zero carbon economy by 2050.\n\nThe facilities, to be built in northern England by a date yet to be specified, come under the Net Zero Teesside Power and Northern Endurance Partnership banners.\n\nThe pair on Friday said they had \u201cselected contractors for engineering, procurement, and construction contracts with a combined value of around \u00a34bn\u201d. They added:\n\nThe selection of nine leading specialist contractors ... is a major milestone for the Teesside-based projects, which would contribute to the UK\u2019s journey towards net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nUp to two million tonnes of CO2 would be captured annually before being transported and securely stored in subsea sites beneath the North Sea.\n\nCompanies awarded contracts included energy group Shell and infrastructure specialists Balfour Beatty.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement comes after Rishi Sunak\u2019s administration this week pledged to build new gas-fired power stations to boost energy security.\n\nAt the same time, the UK is rolling out low-carbon energies such as nuclear, solar and wind power in a strategy to combat sky-high domestic electricity and gas bills, which rocketed after key producer Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.\n\n04:22 PM GMT\n\nReckitt Benckiser plunges after infant formula verdict\n\nDettol maker Reckitt Benckiser has fallen 17pc this afternoon. It followed an Illinois jury ordering the company\u2019s Mead Johnson division to pay $60m (\u00a347m) to the mother of a premature baby who died of an intestinal disease after being fed the company\u2019s Enfamil baby formula.\n\nShares plunged on fears that the consumer goods company would face more financial liabilities from lawsuits related to the baby formula.\n\nReckitt told investors that it strongly disagreed with the jury\u2019s decision.\n\nIt said:\n\nWe continue to believe that the allegations from the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers in this case were not supported by the science or experts in the medical community \u2026 It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.\n\nReckitt added that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned\u201d.\n\nSusannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\n\nIt\u2019s not simply the size of this payout which has caused nervousness, but the fact a long line of other lawsuits are pending, which could mount up to be a huge sum for the company.\n\n04:19 PM GMT\n\nActivist investor Oasis builds stake in Britain\u2019s biggest sandwich maker\n\nA Hong Kong-based activist investor has built up shares in Britain\u2019s biggest sandwich maker after its share price fell by almost 50pc in the last five years. Daniel Woolfson reports:\n\nOasis Management has acquired almost 5pc of the shares in Greencore, a major supplier of sandwiches and ready meals to the UK\u2019s major supermarkets.\n\nGreencore produces 779m sandwiches a year and supplies Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.\n\nAs well as sandwiches, it makes sushi, soups, packaged ready-meals and other chilled supermarket products. It employs around 13,600 people across the UK.\n\nIts shares have been languishing since the pandemic, falling more than 45pc over the last five years.\n\nOasis has waged shareholder campaigns at a number of prominent consumer companies over recent years.\n\nA stake of almost 5pc of the company would make Oasis one of Greencore\u2019s largest shareholders. It is understood that Oasis plans to continue buying shares. Once its stake rises above 5pc, it will be required to make a formal disclosure.\n\nOasis\u2019s European boss, Daniel Wosner, is understood to have met with executives at Greencore, the Financial Times, which first reported the news, said.\n\n04:09 PM GMT\n\nThames Water\u2019s lenders hire advisors before \u00a3190m debt deadline\n\nLenders to Thames Water\u2019s parent company have reportedly hired advisers weeks before a \u00a3190m debt becomes due.\n\nSky News says a syndicate of financiers have hired accountancy firm EY, amid concerns from regulators and politicians about the water company\u2019s ability to survive.\n\nIn December, Thames Water admitted to MPs that the holding company did not \u201ccurrently\u201d have the money to make the repayment due in April.\n\nChris Weston, the newly appointed boss of Thames Water, has vowed to \u201crestore confidence\u201d in the business.\n\nHe said:\n\nI recognise that this business is critical to both society and the UK and how important it is that we restore confidence in our operations and financial position.\n\nThames Water declined to comment.

Americans\u2019 outlook has essentially remained fixed since January, when it leapt higher.\n\nThe consumer sentiment figure follows inflation reports this week that showed that, for a second straight month, prices rose at a pace faster than is consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2pc target.\n\nThe consumer price index rose 3.2pc in February compared with a year ago, up from 3.1pc in January.\n\nYet the University of Michigan report showed that Americans\u2019 outlook for inflation hasn\u2019t changed this month compared with February. Consumers expect inflation over the next year to be 3pc, the same as in the previous month.\n\n03:31 PM GMT\n\nHanding over\n\nAlex Singleton is taking over now and will keep posting live updates into the evening.

The output of manufacturing rose 0.8% and mining rose 2.2%. Both reflect a rebound from the weather-induced declines in January. Output of utilities fell in February due to warmer temperatures. pic.twitter.com/In4GdCsVSj\n\n\u2014 Dr Thomas Kevin Swift (@DrTKSwift) March 15, 2024\n\n02:59 PM GMT\n\nRail workers prepare to go on

Nissan president and chief executive Makoto Uchida announced the agreement alongside Honda president and director Toshihiro Mibe - PHILIP FONG/AFP via Getty Images\n\n07:18 AM GMT\n\nBarratt\u2019s \u00a32.5bn deal to buy Redrow faces investigation from competition watchdog\n\nThe competition watchdog has launched an investigation into a \u00a32.5bn merger between two of Britain\u2019s biggest house builders.\n\nBarratt Developments, the country\u2019s largest housebuilder, announced plans last month to buy competitor Redrow in a deal that will allow the combined company to build around 22,000 homes each year.\n\nHowever, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has revealed it is investigating whether the deal may \u201cresult in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services\u201d.\n\nBoth housebuilders are now facing two separate inquiries by the regulator after the CMA last month opened an investigation looking at suspected illegal information sharing between Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders amid fears that collusion in the industry has pushed up prices.\n\nThe watchdog will investigate the practices of Barratt Developments, Bellway, Berkeley, Bloor Homes, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey, and Vistry.\n\nThe CMA today issued an invitation for comments on Barratt Developments\u2019 proposed \u00a32.5bn takeover of Redrow.\n\nInterested parties have until April 2 to submit their views before the regulator begins the next phase of its inquiry. Barratt's \u00a32.5bn takeover of Redrow will be investigated by the competition regulator - REUTERS/Paul Childs\n\n07:12 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me. A \u00a32.5bn merger between housebuilders Barratt and Redrow will be investigated by the competition regulator.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority\u00a0has announced it will examine the tie up, which will build create a company that builds around 22,000 homes each year.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Ageing Whitehall computer systems threaten to wreck hopes of AI revolution, says watchdog | Inefficient and risky Government IT systems could derail attempts to use artificial intelligence\n\n2) Why John Lewis went back to basics in the battle to recover its mojo | The partnership is injecting new life into its tired stores as it finally returns to profit\n\n3) Two-thirds of sickness benefit claimants never have to find a job | 1.5m applying for Universal Credit-linked benefits granted most generous welfare payments\n\n4) Ministers push back on new telegraph poles after broadband roll-out sparks anger | Rapid deployment of infrastructure for new networks leading to \u2018blot on the landscape\u2019\n\n5) Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: Labour economists see rising recession danger in the US | Climbing unemployment is pushing America\u2019s economy perilously close to the edge\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nAsian markets retreated, with Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark falling nearly 2pc, after a mixed batch of data on the US economy dashed hopes that easier interest rates are coming soon.\n\nTokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 declined 0.3pc to 38,707.64, while the Kospi in South Korea sank 1.9pc to 2,666.84.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down 1.7pc at 16,676.70 after reports said housing prices have continued to fall since February.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index gained 0.3pc to 3,055.16, while the S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.9pc to 7,670.30.\n\nUS stocks slipped yesterday after a mixed batch of economic data seemed dampened hopes that easier interest rates will arrive quickly.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.3pc, to 5,150.48, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set on Tuesday.

The issue has now been resolved in the UK and Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe thank customers for their patience and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers,\u201d it posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nPeople in Australia posted pictures on social media of closed restaurants and signs alerting diners that McDonald\u2019s could not accept orders.\n\nSome stores were reported to be only accepting cash.\n\nThe disruption comes after a difficult year for McDonald\u2019s. McDonald's chief Chris Kempczinski said the boycott of the fast food chain in certain locations was having a material impact on sales - ean Marc-Giboux/AP\n\nThe chain\u2019s chief executive Chris Kempczinski, said in January that sales were being hurt by \u201cmisinformation\u201d about McDonald\u2019s alleged support for Israel in the wake of the Gaza conflict.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups have called for boycotts and staged protests after photos and videos on social media showed franchised stores in Israel giving out free meals to soldiers following Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has also been at the centre of a sexual harassment scandal in the UK, after a BBC investigation unearthed multiple claims of abuse, harassment and bullying of staff at its restaurants.\n\nAlistair Macrow, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK & Ireland, has called the reports \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d.\n\nHe told MPs on the Commons business and trade committee in November that McDonald\u2019s would \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to address the issue.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, McDonald's Corp. MCD, RTX Corp. RTX, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Southern Copper Corp. SCCO.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Alphabet, McDonald's and RTX\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., McDonald's Corp. and RTX Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have gained +51.2% over the past year, in-line with the Zacks Tech sector\u2019s gain of +51.5%, but significantly better than the S&P 500 index's +31.9% gain. The company\u2019s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Google\u2019s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. Additionally, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the near term. Alphabet\u2019s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s strong efforts to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Also, its expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. However, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nMcDonald's shares have gained +8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry\u2019s gain of +11.6%. The company is likely to benefit from strong comps performance, marketing campaigns and a loyalty program. During fourth-quarter 2023, McDonald's U.K. solidified its position as a go-to destination for quality food at exceptional value, thus, boosting customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nMcDonald's is also increasing its focus on menu innovation, as it believes that the strengthening of the core menu and solid marketing are likely to pave the way for additional growth in the upcoming periods. Also, the focus on Accelerating the Arches strategy bodes well.\r\n\r\nEarnings estimates for 2024 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism about the stock\u2019s growth potential. Yet, macroeconomic challenges and commodity and wage inflation are primary headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on McDonald\u2019s here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past six months (+21.1% vs. +12.2%). The company continues to receive ample orders from the Pentagon and its foreign allies for its wide range of combat-proven defense products.\r\n\r\nA steadily recovering commercial air traffic, both domestic and international, is expected to bolster commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for the company. RTX holds a solid financial position which should enable it to make successful share repurchase.\r\n\r\nHowever, the appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock. Also, as rising crude price tends to put cost pressure on airlines, operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX may be impacted. The company might also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against RTX\u2019s missile and defense unit.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Progressive Corp. and Southern Copper Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Restaurant stocks are rising again after several difficult years during the Covid-19 pandemic. The S&P 500 Restaurants Sub Industry Index has increased .5% this year, and is up 16% from a low reached in October of last year during a broad market downturn.\n\nWhile not all restaurant stocks are flying high right now, many have turned a corner and are succeeding in the intensely competitive industry. Companies are capitalizing on the return of in-person dining by innovating their menus, renovating their restaurant locations and spending heavily on promotions to keep customer traffic brisk. Specifically, these three companies look like they will be cooking up success in March 2024.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) just raised its quarterly dividend by 25% after it reported strong financial results for the final quarter of 2023. Going forward, Domino\u2019s will pay its shareholders a quarterly dividend of $1.51 a share, up from $1.21 previously. Domino\u2019s board of directors also approved a new stock buyback of up to $1 billion, which is in addition to the $141 million that\u2019s remaining on a current share repurchase program.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese benefits to shareholders compliment the performance of DPZ stock, which is up 8% this year and up 45% in the last 12 months. Fueling all of this are strong earnings from Domino\u2019s Pizza and continued growth at the company. Domino\u2019s topped Wall Street forecasts for both profits and sales in its most recent earnings print. The company also opened more than 300 overseas locations and 100 new stores in America in just the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSpeaking of strong earnings, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) also continues to issue solid financial results. The company that owns and operates Burger King, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs, recently reported earnings per share (EPS) of 75 cents versus 73 cents that was expected. Revenue in Q4 2023 was $1.82 billion, slightly ahead of the $1.81 billion that was forecast. Total sales were up 8% from a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey to the company\u2019s success has been a turnaround at Burger King. Restaurant Brands has spent heavily to remodel Burger King restaurants and is also investing in advertising and marketing to drive customer traffic and sales. Restaurant Brands has also acquired Burger King\u2019s largest U.S. franchisee, Carrols Restaurant Group, in a $1 billion deal to help accelerate renovations at various outlets. QSR stock is up 33% in the past year. As far as restaurant stocks go, this diversified brand with many different holdings is a good choice for investors.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has work to do, but the world\u2019s largest quick-service restaurant chain has launched an aggressive growth strategy that should lift its stock higher. At the end of last year, McDonald\u2019s announced plans to open 10,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. The targets are part of the company\u2019s plans to grow its worldwide sales and boost its stock.\n\nManagement said that by 2027 they want to have 50,000 restaurant locations globally. To reach that goal, McDonald\u2019s plans to open 900 new locations in America, 1,900 restaurants internationally and 7,000 units in developing markets. The company is actively testing a new spin-off brand called \u201cCosMc\u2019s,\u201d targeting teens and twentysomethings. The growth strategy arrives as McDonald\u2019s continues to post decent financial results.\n\nSadly, the growth plan and earnings haven\u2019t helped MCD stock lately as it\u2019s down 5.5% year to date (YTD). But it is likely only a matter of time before investors rediscover this iconic restaurant stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued dow stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to Dow stocks and our coverage of some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records.\n\nAnother change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively.\u00a0 reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.\n\nIn fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.\n\nHowever, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.\n\nThis wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:\n\nSince the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion.\n\nWith these details in mind, we decided to see which Dow stocks are finding favor among analysts. A handful of notable picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). 13 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we ranked all components of the Dow 30 stock index by the average share price percentage upside. Out of these, the stocks with the highest upside were selected. Data for the price targets was sourced from Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor these undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\n13. Verizon Communications Inc.

        "title": "McDonald\u2019s Stock (NYSE:MCD): Investors Are Lovin\u2019 It!",
        "content": "McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) iconic \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d slogan resonates not only with customers but also with shareholders, who keep driving the stock higher. The fast-food giant continues to rapidly increase its revenues and earnings with no indication of slowing down. Its affordable offerings mix keeps pushing higher sales in existing locations, while aggressive new restaurant openings, including CosMc\u2019s, a new beverage-led concept, promise sustained growth momentum. Accordingly, I remain bullish on MCD.\n\nDouble-Digit Growth Persists with No Signs of Slowing Down\n\nSeeing McDonald\u2019s keep delivering double-digit revenue growth with no signs of slowing down is absolutely remarkable. You would assume that many of the company\u2019s locations should have already maximized their sales potential, as they have been in business for years.\n\nHowever, by deploying smart sales tactics, such as incentivizing loyalty program participation and rolling out the annual Monopoly promotion, McDonald\u2019s has been able to drive growing spending per store. The push of digital ordering for faster service and, crucially, maintaining competitive prices in an inflationary environment has also contributed to continuous growth in same-store sales.\n\nIn Canada, for example, McDonald\u2019s maintained its iconic McMuffin and hot coffee bundle throughout Q4, offering a compelling bundle during the crucial morning hours. This led to notable gains in breakfast market share. McDonald\u2019s also incentivized in-app orders and promoted the advantages of the \u201cReady on Arrival\u201d offering, resulting in a 60-second reduction in wait times for curbside pickups nationwide.\n\nThe result of these initiatives, and again, importantly, McDonald\u2019s menu mix remaining quite affordable against other eating-out options, drove same-store sales growth of 9% in Fiscal 2023. Combined with McDonald\u2019s achieving 1,547 net restaurant openings during the year, pushing its total location count to 41,822, total revenues for the year rose by 10% to $25.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpanding Operating Margins Drove Record Profits\n\nThe brilliance of McDonald\u2019s business model lies in its ability to grow profits at a greater pace than its sales due to its royalty-based structure. With a whopping 95% of its locations operating under franchise agreements, the company makes its money mainly from royalties and the rent its franchises pay for on its properties.\n\nAs same-store sales climb, McDonald\u2019s effortlessly collects higher royalties without bearing additional expenses. Because of this, the company inherently enjoys expanding profit margins over time, helping its bottom-line growth outpace its revenue growth. Indeed, in FY2023, McDonald\u2019s operating profit margin reached a record 45.9%, up from 44.6% last year, resulting in the company\u2019s net income surging by 37% to $8.47 billion. Buybacks further boosted EPS, which grew by 39% to a record $11.56.\n\nGrowth Catalysts Remain Robust, Justifying McDonald\u2019s Valuation\n\nMcDonald\u2019s growth catalysts remain robust, in my view, which should translate to robust revenue growth and, as explained, even more significant earnings growth. Specifically, the company expects to continue expanding its global footprint and to reach 50,000 restaurants by 2027. This implies an acceleration to the current pace of openings.\n\nFurther, McDonald\u2019s has identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across its top six markets: beverage-led experiences, where its core business typically underindexes. In a little less than a year, when this opportunity was identified, McDonald\u2019s opened a pilot CosMc\u2019s restaurant, attracting significant buzz.\n\nThis single location is now based in Bolingbrook, IL, and management plans to run a 10-store test. Any contribution to revenues will be minimal in the beginning, of course. However, McDonald\u2019s now has the opportunity to slowly build a new brand in the beverage space, which could eventually grow into a big franchise with thousands of locations. This initiative alone could make for a significant long-term sales growth tailwind on top of McDonald\u2019s core brand.\n\nTherefore, despite McDonald\u2019s prolonged share price rally, I believe that its bullish momentum could be very well maintained. In the meantime, the stock\u2019s forward P/E of 22.7 appears well-justified, considering the company\u2019s underlying earnings growth and future growth catalysts.\n\nIs MCD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLooking at Wall Street\u2019s view on the stock, McDonald\u2019s features a Moderate Buy consensus rating. This is based on 18 Buys and eight Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. At $323.24, the average\u00a0MCD stock forecast suggests 14.3% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell MCD stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0David Palmer\u00a0from Evercore ISI, with an average return of 16.14% per rating and a 98% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald\u2019s continues to demonstrate impressive, double-digit revenue increases while posting record operating margins and earnings. With initiatives like digital ordering, menu bundling, and maintaining affordable prices, the company has been able to keep driving growing traffic in its stores and even capture market share in some categories.\n\nManagement\u2019s plan to reach 50,000 locations by 2027, as well as the potential of CosMc\u2019s growing into a big franchise opportunity for McDonald\u2019s, should keep boosting its financials. Thus, I can see the stock\u2019s ongoing bullish momentum lasting, especially given that its valuation remains at rather reasonable levels.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "(Reuters) - McDonald's international sales will fall sequentially in the current quarter, pressured by the conflict in the Middle East and demand weakness in China, CFO Ian Borden said on Wednesday, sending its shares down 2% in early trade.\n\nFirst-quarter comparable sales in McDonald's International Developmental Licensed Markets segment will be \"slightly lower\" than the prior three-month period, Borden said at the UBS Global Consumer and Retail Conference.\n\nThe company in February widely missed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter sales in the segment, partly due to protests and boycott campaigns against several Western brands over their perceived pro-Israeli stance in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\"We continue to deal with the impacts of the war in the Middle East. But we're also seeing what I would call a sluggish start in China this year,\" Borden said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGlobal businesses such as McDonald's are also grappling with weak demand in China as employment issues, a deepening property crisis and economic uncertainties put a damper on consumer sentiment.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "title": "Column: A Trump judge eviscerates a pro-worker regulation at the request of big employers",
        "content": "McDonald's says it's hiring, but who's the real employer? (Associated Press)\n\nThe Biden administration's support of worker rights and union organizing has become a byword.\n\nPresident Biden has restored the National Labor Relations Board to its traditional role as protector of collective bargaining rights. He walked the United Auto Workers picket line during its ultimately successful contract negotiations with the Big Three automakers.\n\nHe has nominated and renominated the outstanding worker advocate Julie Su as secretary of Labor. And he swept a gaggle of Trump-appointed union-busters and anti-union ideologues out of a key federal agency responsible for ruling on disputes involving government union contracts.\n\nAs major companies have consciously invested in building brands...as the cornerstone of their business strategy, they have also shed their role as the direct employer of the people responsible for providing their products and services.\n\nDavid Weil, \"The Fissured Workplace\"\n\nBut now he has run up against a brick wall of hard-right anti-union ideology put in place by his predecessor: another Trump-appointed ultra-partisan federal judge using his perch in an obscure courthouse to make policy for the entire nation.\n\nWe're talking about J. Campbell Barker of the U.S. District Court of Tyler, Texas. Last week Barker, ruling in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 12 other business lobbies, invalidated an NLRB rule aimed at broadening the standard by which big corporations could be held jointly responsible for the welfare and unionization rights of workers employed by their franchisees.\n\nBarker was appointed by Trump in 2019 after a career as a Texas state lawyer writing briefs to restrict voting rights and LGBTQ+ rights, supporting Trump's travel ban on Muslim-majority nations and attacking access to contraceptives and abortion.\n\nOn March 8, he ruled that the NLRB's joint-employer regulation, issued in October, was so broad that it would \"treat virtually every entity that contracts for labor as a joint employer.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMany workers whose wages or workplace conditions were effectively dictated by big companies that fobbed their responsibilities onto franchise owners would consider that anything but a drawback.\n\nThe NLRB is certain to appeal Barker's decision, probably to the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has set its own standard for far-right judicial overreach. The board had earlier argued that Barker shouldn't have taken the lawsuit in the first place, because by law NLRB final rules can be appealed only to the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia. Barker rejected that argument.\n\nRead more:Column: Elon Musk is suing to stop the government from enforcing labor laws. The Supreme Court might agree with him\n\nBig business has been fighting efforts to broaden legal interpretations of joint-employer status for decades. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit included lobbies for builders, restaurants, hotels and convenience stores.\n\nMany of them base their business models on their ability to control workplace conditions from afar while pushing legal liability for labor violations onto franchise owners, whom they often describe (inaccurately) as small mom-and-pop operations just scraping by.\n\nAmong the plaintiffs is the Chamber of Commerce of Longview, Texas. Longview is a small city in the east Texas oil patch; presumably its chamber was recruited because the plaintiffs figured that its presence would give them standing to sue in the federal district court in Tyler, which has two judges, both appointed by Donald Trump, including Barker. They got their wish.\n\nAnother plaintiff is the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace. You might suppose that an organization bearing that name represents the whole panoply of business stakeholders, from fast-food workers to corporate employers, but no.\n\n\"Democratic\" here means much the same thing as it did when \"German Democratic Republic\" signified a Communist dictatorship in East Germany, which was anything but a democratic workers' paradise. The coalition comprises 600 employer groups \"joined by their mutual concern over regulatory overreach by the National Labor Relations Board.\"\n\nNow let's turn to the lawsuit itself. If you surmise that its opening brief, filed on Nov. 9, bristled with disinformation, you would be right.\n\nThe brief stated that the NLRB \"rammed\" the rule changes through on the claim that \"the 90-year-old National Labor Relations Act has been misinterpreted for most of its existence.\" (Actually, the board is only 88 years old.)\n\nA couple of points here. First, it's a little unclear what the plaintiffs meant by \"ramming through\" the new rule. The NLRB first proposed the rule in September 2022, and didn't promulgate it until 13 months later. In the interim it put the proposal out for public comments, of which it received 13,000.\n\nRead more:Column: American unions have finally remembered how to win\n\nThe plaintiffs implied that the NLRB's joint-employer rules have been static since the board's founding in 1935. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe standard came before the Supreme Court more than once, starting in 1964. The board amended it, sometimes narrowing and sometimes expanding its definition of joint employer, in 1982, 2002, 2007, 2018 and 2020, before the latest version was issued in October.\n\nThe plaintiffs wring their hands over the fact that the board reversed a rule that it \"promulgated just three years ago.\" You might ask yourself: Hmm, what changed in Washington between 2020 and 2023?\n\nIf you guessed that the Trump administration was turned out of office and replaced by the Biden administration, well done.\n\nThe latter gave the NLRB a Democratic majority, just as the former had given it a Republican majority. Presidents have the power to do that and most have done so when they were succeeding a president of the other party. So when the plaintiffs depict the board as an unchanging entity that reversed itself, they're lying, possibly in the hope that a judge will be too stupid to notice their sleight of hand. Or too partisan to care.\n\nBut they can't avoid explicitly stating their true concern with the joint-employer rule: The rule threatens employers with \"billions of dollars in liability and costs.\"\n\nDefining joint-employer responsibilities has become more important in recent decades as more businesses turn to the franchise model, which gives fast-food, hotel and retailing behemoths plausible deniability over how their front-line workers are treated and paid.\n\n\"As major companies have consciously invested in building brands ... as the cornerstone of their business strategy,\" labor expert David Weil wrote in his 2014 book \"The Fissured Workplace,\" \"they have also shed their role as the direct employer of the people responsible for providing their products and services.\" The trend, Weil wrote, encompasses hotel maids, cable installers, commercial janitors and merchandise pickers in Amazon warehouses \u2014 all are actually on the payroll of third-party employment firms.\n\nRead more:Column: It's a happy Labor Day indeed after NLRB cracks down on employer sabotage of union elections\n\n(By the way, Biden nominated Weil in 2021 to a high-level position at the Department of Labor, but the nomination was killed by opposition from Republicans and Big Business.)\n\nIn recent years, the principal target of joint-employer cases at the NLRB has been McDonald's. That's unsurprising, since with more than $119 billion in overall international sales it's the largest franchisor in the world.\n\nThe Obama-era NLRB brought a massive case against the company and 29 franchisees in 2014, which turned into what was regarded as the biggest case the board ever instituted, and the longest. The main issue was whether the company had participated in \u2014 in fact, helped to run \u2014 a nationwide attack on the Fight for $15 union campaign for a higher minimum wage at its restaurants.\n\nThen-NLRB general counsel Richard Griffin alleged at the outset that the franchisees fired, suspended, cut work hours, threatened, spied on and interrogated employees involved in the union campaign, all of which he interpreted as illegal responses to union organizing.\n\nAdministrative Law Judge Lauren Esposito cited evidence that the anti-union response was \"formulated and implemented\" from McDonald's headquarters in Chicago and that the company provided franchisees with \"suggested policies\" and legal training in labor relations \u2014 so much so that the company was properly regarded as the franchise workers' joint employer.\n\nBy the time Esposito prepared to rule, Trump was president. He replaced Griffin with Peter Robb, whose record as an anti-labor lawyer was well nigh unassailable and whose hostility to the joint-employer rule was manifest. Before Esposito could rule, Robb settled the cases against the franchisees by ordering back pay for the workers who were fired or had their hours cut. But the settlements didn't involve McDonald's Corp., which therefore skated on the joint-employer issue.\n\nRead more:Column: Businesses keep complaining about shoplifting, but wage theft is a bigger crime\n\nEsposito rejected the settlements, but she was overruled by the NLRB's new, Republican majority. The sole dissent came from Lauren McFerran, an Obama appointee who was the only Democrat then on the board.\n\n\"A finding of joint-employer status,\" she wrote, \"would have important collateral consequences for McDonald\u2019s, in both unfair labor practice proceedings involving its franchisees and ... if workers employed at McDonald\u2019s franchisees sought to organize (that is, unionize).\"\n\nIn other words, the Trump NLRB moved heaven and earth to keep McDonald's from being declared a joint employer.\n\nMcFerran is now chair of the NLRB, presiding over a 3-1 Democratic majority. (One seat on the five-member board is vacant.)\n\nThe NLRB's joint-employer rule would bring millions of workers \u2014 typically low-wage workers without health or retirement benefits and virtually no job security \u2014 under the umbrella of their well-heeled ultimate employers. It's possible, if not certain, that they would see an improvement in their working lives, through better wages and more opportunity to unionize.\n\nEven big franchisees or labor brokers don't have to care about their public image \u2014 most customers don't even know they exist. But McDonald's, Marriott, Walmart and Amazon have a lot to lose in public esteem by getting tagged as an abuser of workers.\n\nIf the NLRB had its way, they would no longer be getting away with shedding their responsibilities. Let's hope that Judge Barker's ruling is a temporary obstacle to making the world work better.\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

        "content": "Fast food giants, from McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) to Burger King (QSR) and Taco Bell (YUM), are duking it out for a share of the breakfast pie.\n\nBut not all comers will get a taste of sweet results. As big chains look for ways to counter declining foot traffic and grow beyond the crowded lunch and dinner space, breakfast is becoming a battleground.\n\n\"A lot of competition is now stepping up to win,\" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWith the cost of eating out staying persistently high, pinched consumers may opt for breakfast as a treat over more expensive options, per Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop.\n\nThat means a morning McMuffin sale may not cannibalize an evening Big Mac sale, but a diner might shell out for some fast food hot cakes instead of a sit-down brunch.\n\nA successful breakfast strategy could attract visitors who weren't coming to the restaurant before and complement its core offerings, said Gargiulo.\n\nCurrently, McDonald's is the dominant player in the space. In 2023, Golden Arches received 35.4% of all 7am to 10am visits to fast food, quick service restaurants, breakfast, coffee, bakeries and dessert shops.\n\nThat's followed by Starbucks (15.9% market share), Dunkin' Donuts (14.0%) and Burger King (4.5%).\n\nNow, Wendy's is determined to catch up. CEO Kirk Tanner said on a recent earnings call that breakfast is \"one of the most compelling levers\" to grow sales and margins, without the need for additional labor.\n\nThe chain is investing $55 million in advertising in the US and Canada to supercharge its morning sales, and unveiled a Cinnabon pull-apart cup in February to mark four years in the breakfast arena.\n\nAs a large part of a restaurant's costs are fixed \u2014 like machinery or rent\u2014 revenue from breakfast items \"are truly incremental to a brand,\" said Dunlop. In addition to lower staffing needs, breakfast foods usually use items like bread and eggs that are cheaper than beef patties.\n\nStory continues\n\nOnce a company's breakfast offering hits scale, it tends to be more lucrative than sales in other parts of the day. Breakfast diners are also more habitual, so chains who make themselves a part of consumers' morning routine can parlay that into higher participation in loyalty programs and digital sales. IRVINE, CA - SEPTEMBER 12: The Breakfast Crunchwrap is a staple on Taco Bell's breakfast menu. (Photo by Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images for Taco Bell) (Joshua Blanchard via Getty Images)\n\nBut the competition is fierce. Taco Bell is testing breakfast tots and leaning into menu offerings like a Bell Breakfast Box. Burger King is luring customers with promotions, including a March special where eaters can get a free breakfast item with any purchase of $1 or more.\n\nSo who wins?\n\nGargiulo, who warned that making the prices of breakfast too low could cut into a chain's lunch sales, said \"everybody has a slightly different competitive advantage over the others.\"\n\nWhile McDonald's has a leg up on location, Wendy's has its fresh never frozen allure, and Taco Bell is focused on attracting Gen Z and millennials, per Gargiulo.\n\nWendy's is targeting a 50% bump in its breakfast business, says Dunlop, which would put it on par with Burger King, who gets 15% of its total sales from breakfast. McDonald's gets about 30% of total sales from its morning business.\n\nBut execution is critical in this race. \"Depending on your breakfast program, the labor, inventory, insurance, and utilities costs may rise because you are operating for more hours and are carrying and storing more [inventory]. If you don\u2019t have sufficient demand for your breakfast, your margins can deteriorate,\" said Gargiulo.

(Photo by Presley Ann/Getty Images for IHOP) (Presley Ann via Getty Images)\n\nBeyond fast food, other longtime player like IHOP are also fighting to hang on to their corner of the market.\n\nIHOP (DIN) reported a 1.6% jump in US same store sales last quarter, with 20.4% of total sales coming from digital and takeout orders.\n\nJohn Peyton, CEO of its parent company Dine Brands Global, told Yahoo Finance that the secret to IHOP's success is its fresh ingredients.\n\n\"We've been winning for years, because we're made from scratch,\" he said.\n\nGetting into this high stakes game will become increasingly difficult as the market gets more saturated. Diners aren't likely to eat two breakfast, so restaurants can only win share by taking sales from each other.\n\n\"Absent a unique, structural growth tailwind, breakfast becomes nearly a zero-sum game,\" said Dunlop. \"It's an attractive space, you can see why companies are targeting it, and barriers to success are much higher than barriers to entry,\" Dunlop said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. STKS is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2023 results on Mar 14. In the last reported quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 260%.\n\nHow Are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at 14 cents, indicating a decline of 26.3% from 19 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $97 million. The metric suggests growth of 9.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nThe ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nThe ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. Quote\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the factors likely to impact the company\u2019s performance in the quarter to be reported.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nONE Group\u2019s fourth-quarter top line is expected to increase from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels, courtesy of strength in digital engagement, momentum in event bookings and new store openings. This and the emphasis on planned seasonal offerings at STK and Kona Grill (for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve) and pricing optimizations are likely to have aided the company\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis on everyday value offerings through the Happy Hour program, the night out menu featuring a comprehensive meal package at favorable prices and the promotion of happy hour deals via digital marketing efforts are likely to have attracted more customers in the reported quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter owned restaurant revenues is pegged at $93 million, suggesting an increase from $84 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nChallenges such as wage inflation, elevated marketing expenses, and additional investments for new restaurant openings are expected to have exerted downward pressure on the company's bottom line in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for ONE Group this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that's not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: ONE Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company has a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecent Retail-Wholesale Releases\n\nMcDonald's Corporation MCD reported mixed fourth-quarter 2023 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, MCD reported adjusted EPS of $2.95, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81. Adjusted earnings increased 11% year over year.\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $6.4 billion missed the consensus mark of $6.5 billion. The top line rose 8% year over year. The upside was backed by menu price increases, effective marketing campaigns and continued digital and delivery growth.\n\nYum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC reported impressive fourth-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, YUMC reported adjusted EPS of 25 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents. The bottom line surged 92.3% from 13 cents reported a year ago.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2.5 billion outpaced the consensus mark of $2.4 billion. The top line rose 19.4% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding foreign currency translation, revenues increased 21% year over year. The upside can be attributed to net new unit contribution (12%) and same-store sales growth (4%).\r\n\r\nBrinker International, Inc. EAT reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. Effective marketing and pricing strategies backed the upside. Sequential improvements in guest traffic bode well.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, EAT reported adjusted EPS of 99 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.47. The company reported adjusted EPS of 76 cents in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $1.07 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 billion. However, the top line increased 5.4% on a year-over-year basis.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with McDonald's (MCD) standing at $294.82, reflecting a +0.78% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.11%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.41%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had gained 1.06% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 2.97%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.7%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of McDonald's in its upcoming release. On that day, McDonald's is projected to report earnings of $2.72 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.42%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $6.18 billion, indicating a 4.86% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.38 per share and revenue of $26.96 billion, which would represent changes of +3.69% and +5.75%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for McDonald's. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% higher. McDonald's currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note McDonald's's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.63. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 20.88.\n\nIt's also important to note that MCD currently trades at a PEG ratio of 3.16. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Retail - Restaurants industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.97 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 89, which puts it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When most people think of fast food restaurants, they immediately think of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) which is up by 62% over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, smaller fast food chains offer more growth potential for long-term investors. Some of these same corporations provide healthier food which appeals to consumers. While investors can choose from many healthier fast food stocks, few of them match up to Chipotle (NYSE:CMG).\n\nShares of the Mexican fast food chain are up by 76% over the past year. That\u2019s more than McDonald\u2019s 5-year gain. Also, CMG is up by 337% over the past five years. The firm is still expanding its profit margins while growing at a solid rate.\n\nChipotle increased its revenue by 15.4% year over year (YOY) in the fourth quarter of 2023. Diluted EPS increased by 27.3% YOY. Further, the company plans to open an additional 285 to 315 restaurants in 2024 which will further strengthen its growth rates. Therefore, the firm looks poised to gain market share and reward long-term investors.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is the parent company of many athletic apparel and sneaker brands like Hoka, Ugg, and Teva. The firm is gaining market share while posting strong financials.\n\nIn the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024, Deckers Outdoor achieved 16% YOY revenue growth. Also, the company increased its diluted EPS by 44% YOY. The athletic apparel company used its Q3 report to raise revenue and diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHoka and Ugg led the way to record revenue. Unlike many stocks with these growth numbers, Deckers Outdoor still has a reasonable valuation. Shares trade at a 33 P/E ratio.\n\nThe recent S&P 500 addition has a history of rewarding long-term investors. Shares are up by 113% over the past year and have gained 551% over the past five years. Analysts have been bullish on this stock and currently rate it as a strong buy. The highest price target of $1,150 suggests a 25% upside from the current price.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) offers stability since people will always turn to the retailer for affordable products. The company has specialized in this area for more than 60 years and has an impressive track record of rewarding long-term investors.\n\nShares are up by 30% over the past year and have gained 85% over the past five years. Additionally, the stock offers a 1.40% dividend yield for investors who seek cash flow from their investments.\n\nWalmart\u2019s recent earnings report demonstrates why the company is positioned to reward investors. Revenue increased by 5.7% YOY. Notable improvements in e-commerce and advertising revenue can ignite future growth. Walmart\u2019s recent acquisition of Vizio Holdings will further strengthen its rising advertising segment.\n\nFinally, the e-commerce segment was up by 23% YOY and surpassed $100 billion in annual revenue. That\u2019s compared to the $648.1 billion in full year revenue. Advertising revenue increased by 28% YOY. Therefore, Walmart is tapping into multiple growth verticals that can lead to revenue and earnings acceleration in the upcoming quarters.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in DECK.

        "content": "In the last year, many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald's\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Christopher Kempczinski, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$280 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$293, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 16% of Christopher Kempczinski's holding.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in McDonald's than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nInsiders At McDonald's Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders sold US$2.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that McDonald's insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$260m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The McDonald's Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders haven't bought McDonald's stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since McDonald's is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for McDonald's that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\n\nOf course McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\nAccording to the Migration Data Portal in 2022, the number of international migrant workers has steadily increased over the years, reaching 169 million by 2019. Of this total, 58.5% are male, while 41.5% are female. Women, in particular, are often employed in low-paid and low-skilled jobs. One of the most common reasons for immigration is the limited job opportunities in the labor market. Many people relocate to developed nations in pursuit of a better quality of life, seeking improved and higher-paying jobs, even in cases of lower education and no special skills.\n\nUnskilled Worker Immigration-- Potential for Economic Growth\n\nLow-skilled or unskilled labor/workers are typically defined as individuals employed in jobs that require little or no experience or training, often involving routine tasks. However, their role in the economy should not be underestimated. Many companies value unskilled labor as it constitutes a significant portion of their workforce. The immigration of unskilled or low-skilled workers also has far-reaching implications globally. While the increase in international migration has been associated with higher economic gains for the global GDP, ranging from 20% to 60%, unskilled immigration itself can contribute to elevated labor productivity and GDP per capita in host countries. The resulting gains can be distributed across populations in both immigrant and emigrant countries.\n\nUnskilled Immigration-- A Contentious Issue\n\nWhile immigration remains a politically contentious issue in the US, opinions on encouraging skilled and discouraging unskilled immigrants are also sharply divided. Some, particularly economists, advocate for a more lenient policy towards unskilled labor, contrasting with those who argue that such individuals may displace native workers. A recent study on the US low-skill work visa lottery supports the economists' perspective, revealing that firms forced to reduce their foreign low-skill hires by half experienced an 18% decrease in production and did not increase native hiring either.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for Unskilled Immigrants in the US\n\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that large organizations persist in hiring unskilled or low-skilled immigrants aspiring to obtain citizenship in developed countries like the US. These companies span various industries, including hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR), fast-food giants like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), and even tech conglomerates like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nOne method is the EB-3 Unskilled Visa Program, allowing low-skilled immigrants to replace Americans who are unwilling to take entry-level jobs on a permanent full-time basis, with the desire to gain US citizenship. The Congress has allocated approximately 10,000 visas annually for such jobs. The food sector, in particular, offers multiple low-skill level jobs (entry level) continuously filled by immigrants through the EB-3 Unskilled Visa program. Companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), for instance, utilize this program to hire foreign workers. Currently, 72 US McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE: MCD) franchises are participating in this program, resulting in 3,200 employees obtaining their green cards.\n\nEB-3 visas have also proven successful for tech companies such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), 3M Company (NYSE: MMM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). These companies have utilized the program to fill positions during periods of domestic labor shortages since the 1990s. 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to\n\n13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to, we referenced our article on the 20 Countries with the Highest Minimum Wage in the World as a starting point. This preliminary list was designed to identify countries beneficial for unskilled workers in terms of income. We then utilized the Labor Market Mobility score from the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020 to rank these countries in ascending order. Additionally, as a tie-breaker in case of similar rankings, we considered the foreign-born employment rates for low-skilled jobs sourced from the OECD's Settling In 2018 Indicators of Immigrant Integration.\n\nNote: The foreign-born employment rates for low-skilled jobs for the United States were not available in the report due to the fact that the country does not make a distinction between low-skilled and medium-skilled jobs. Information for Canada was also not available in the document.\n\nThe minimum wage rate is calculated on the basis of the exchange rate and therefore, is subject to change.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet us now move to our list of 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\n13. Israel\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nWith a robust minimum wage policy standing at $8.57 per hour, Israel stands out as a compelling option for the unskilled labor force seeking an improved quality of life, especially considering the expected further increase in the minimum wage this year. Recently, the Israeli government implemented a more lenient unskilled labor hiring policy. This change, aimed at addressing labor shortages in the country, permits industrial companies to now recruit unskilled laborfrom previously unauthorized countries, including nations like India and Sri Lanka.\n\nFor immigrants seeking better job opportunities, particularly from emerging or developing nations, Israel emerges as a promising choice. The labor market mobility score indicates a moderately favorable environment, granting immigrants immediate access to the job market, albeit under less favorable conditions than those for nationals. The employment rate for foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs in the country is 8.5%, compared to 5.7% for native-born individuals. This suggests that immigrants are more likely to secure low-skilled jobs making Israel an attractive destination for unskilled workers seeking opportunities.\n\n12. Lithuania\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nLithuania is another country offering a competitive minimum wage of $6.16 per hour to its residents. With an economy centered around finance, tourism, and luxury goods, Lithuania presents numerous job opportunities. Popular positions for foreigners without a degree include roles such as event staff, recreational attendant, hotel bellhop/porter, and more.\n\nSimilar to Israel, Lithuania offers a somewhat favorable situation for immigrants in the labor market. While most immigrants can readily access the job market, they may encounter challenges in finding opportunities for skill advancement or vocational education. Nevertheless, given the higher percentage of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs compared to native-born residents, the country presents a potential opportunity for unskilled immigrants to secure a place in the labor market.\n\n11. France\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nAs an advanced economy, France offers a globally competitive minimum wage of $12.35 per hour. Unskilled workers can find a range of job opportunities in the service sector, including restaurants, bars, and hotels. The thriving tourism industry also presents ample possibilities for individuals without specific skills or experience. Additionally, those with proficiency in English can explore employment opportunities in call centers or as nannies.\n\nFrance's labor market mobility score indicates a favorable environment for immigrants, making it relatively easy for them to find jobs, with some restrictions in more regulated job sectors. However, similar to the previously mentioned countries, accessing training and skill education may pose challenges for immigrants. The country predominantly offers low-skilled jobs to immigrants, evident in the disparity between foreign-born (18.7%) and native-born (9.2%) employment rates in low-skilled positions.\n\n10. Belgium\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 56\n\nAs a developed European country offering its residents numerous benefits, including a high minimum wage, Belgium stands out as a potential destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. With a minimum wage per hour at $12.94, Belgium provides opportunities for individuals desiring to move to the country and secure employment. Various unskilled jobs are available, ranging from positions in food service to construction labor and house cleaning, among others.\n\nThe labor market mobility for newcomers in Belgium is reasonably favorable, allowing non-EU immigrants access to public employment and training opportunities, albeit with some delays. Notably, a significant proportion of low-skilled jobs in the country (21.6%) are filled by foreign-born individuals, surpassing the native-born employment rate of 8.7%. Consequently, Belgium emerges as a viable option for unskilled immigrants seeking job opportunities and a place to settle down.\n\n9. New Zealand\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nEffective from April 1, 2024, the minimum wage in New Zealand is expected to be set at $14.12 per hour. While the country, like many others, is streamlining rules to attract skilled labor, there are ample opportunities for unskilled workers as well. Various industries, including hospitality, manufacturing, retail, supermarkets, and construction, actively employ a significant number of unskilled workers. Immigrants entering the country on job visas in these sectors can not only enjoy competitive salaries in this developed nation but also access many other associated benefits.\n\nWhile new immigrants in New Zealand may experience some delays in complete labor market integration, the labor market mobility score indicates that they can still access the market and benefit from targeted support. Notably, 9.2% of foreign-born residents in New Zealand are employed in low-skilled jobs, showcasing opportunities for newcomers to participate in the workforce.\n\n8. Japan\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nJapan, as a developed nation with a robust economy and a relatively high minimum wage set at $7.46 per hour since October 1, 2023, has undergone significant changes in its immigration policies. In late 2018, the country revised its immigration laws to attract both low-skilled and high-skilled workers to address labor shortages in specific sectors. From April 2019, this initiative aimed to encourage the immigration of 350,000 new individuals\u2014comprising both types of workers\u2014over a consecutive five-year period. Additionally, the country's growth in the agriculture and construction sectors has led to increased employment opportunities for low/unskilled workers.\n\nJapanese immigrant integration policies prioritize equal treatment for permanent residents alongside other citizens. Temporary workers are also granted the opportunity to secure basic subordinate-level jobs. The foreign-born rate of employment in low-skilled jobs is notably higher at 12.5%, compared to the native-born rate of 9%, indicating increased opportunities for unskilled workers to find employment in low-skilled roles within the country.\n\n7. Netherlands\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 65\n\nAs one of the strongest economies in Europe, the Netherlands emerges as a promising destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. The country offers a wealth of diverse job opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, retail, and food service. Notably, the Netherlands provides a highly competitive minimum wage of $14.46 per hour.\n\nThe Netherlands also secures a place in the slightly favorable category of the MIPEX integration index, indicating the ease with which new non-EU migrants can find employment in both public and private sectors. Long-term migrants and families staying in the country also enjoy equal access to education, training, and study grants. Additionally, the proportion of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs surpasses that of the native-born population (15.2% compared to 8.2%), underscoring increased opportunities for unskilled individuals to secure these positions.\n\n6. South Korea\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 65\n\nSouth Korea stands among the nations with a high minimum wage, currently set at $7.40 per hour as of January 1, 2024. The Korean government actively promotes the influx of low-skilled foreign workers into the country, particularly in sectors such as hospitality, mining, and forestry. The goal is to attract and integrate 165,000 new immigrants into these industries.\n\nSouth Korea's labor market mobility score suggests a generally favorable attitude toward immigrants, with long-term residents enjoying easy access to self-employment, public jobs, and general and targeted support. However, temporary workers may encounter some obstacles. Notably, there is a significant difference between the foreign-born and native-born populations in low-skilled level jobs. A substantial 32% of foreign-born individuals were found to be employed in unskilled worker positions, compared to only 9.9% of the native-born population holding such jobs.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Best Places to Retire If You Have No Savings 30 Countries with the Highest GDP in 2023 20 Countries with Highest Income Tax Rates in Europe\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will be looking at the 20 states that produce the most eggs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global eggs market, you can go directly to 5 States That Produce the Most Eggs in the US.\n\nGlobal Eggs Market: An Analysis\n\nThe increasing global population and the surge in demand for protein-rich foods are driving the growth of the global eggs market. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global egg market was estimated to have reached a value of $269.48 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% from 2024 to 2028 to reach a value of $386.75 billion by the end of the forecasted period. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific region was the largest market while the North American region was the second largest. The United States and China are the two countries with the highest egg consumption. The US is also the largest poultry-producing country in the world.\n\nTechnological advancements are expected to drive market growth during the forecast period. Major players in the global eggs market are increasingly adopting big data analytics, robotics, and other technologies to increase productivity in egg production, contributing to market growth.\n\nThe growth of the food service industry is expected to influence the global eggs market positively during the forecast period. Rapid development in the food service segment with the introduction of new and innovative dishes that use eggs in creative ways and the rise of surging demand for bakery and confectionary products are key factors fueling market growth.\n\nProminent Companies Shaping the Eggs Market\n\nThe global eggs market is fragmented, with many regional players focusing on various strategies, including product innovation, mergers and acquisitions, and expansion, to increase their profitability and market share in various regions around the world. Some of the biggest corporations that are influencing the eggs market are McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM), and Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST).\n\nStory continues\n\nPost Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST) is an American consumer packaged goods holding company that holds a group of food businesses operating in the center-of-the-store, refrigerated, food service, and food ingredient categories. It owns and operates Michael Foods, among other brands. Michael Foods processes and distributes potato and egg products. It is one of the largest processors of value-added eggs in the US. Michael Foods supplies its products to both food service and retail markets. On February 1, Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST) reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.69, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.59. The company\u2019s revenue for the quarter grew by 25.51% year-over-year and amounted to $1.97 billion, ahead of market consensus by $45.27 million.\n\nCal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) is an American fresh egg-producing company. It is one of the largest producers and distributors of fresh shell eggs in the US. On December 29, 2023, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a broiler processing plant, hatchery, and feed mill in Dexter, Missouri. These facilities were recently shut down by Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN). Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) plans to repurpose these assets for the production of eggs and egg products. Initially, the company will transform the broiler processing plant into an egg grading facility. In connection with this transaction, the company also aims to collaborate with some of Tyson Foods, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:TSN) former contract farmers to transform their operations to support Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:CALM) cage-free, free-range, or pasture-raised egg production operations.\n\nMillennials, known for their conscious consumer choices, are increasingly shifting towards ethical and sustainable egg production systems, with a growing preference for cage-free eggs driven by concerns for animal welfare and health implications. On February 6, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), one of the most valuable restaurant companies in the world, announced that it has achieved its goal of sourcing 100% cage-free eggs in the United States.\u00a0 In 2015, the company decided to fully transition to purchasing cage-free eggs in the US by 2025. By working together with egg farmers and suppliers in the US, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has achieved its goal two years ahead of the original timeline. The US-based company purchased nearly 2 billion eggs in 2023. This move reflects McDonald's Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) dedication to prioritizing the health and welfare of animals within its supply chain. It also aligns with evolving consumer expectations and preferences for ethically sourced food products.\n\nNow that we have discussed what\u2019s going on in the eggs market, let\u2019s take a look at the 20 states that produce the most eggs in the US. 20 States That Produce the Most Eggs in the US\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article, we have listed the 20 states that produce the most eggs in the US.

        "title": "Chipotle (CMG) Up 0.9% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). Shares have added about 0.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Chipotle due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nChipotle Q4 Earnings & Revenue Beat\n\nChipotle released fourth-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis. Earnings surpassed the consensus estimate for the fourth consecutive quarter.\n\nQ4 Earnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nIn the quarter under review, Chipotle reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.36, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73. The bottom line improved 25% from $8.29 in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2,516.3 million surpassed the consensus mark of $2,492 million. The top line jumped 15.4% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong comparable restaurant sales growth and new restaurant openings. In the reported quarter, Chipotle opened 121 new restaurants with 110 locations including a Chipotlane.\r\n\r\nDigital sales contributed 36.1% to total food and beverage revenues.\r\n\r\nComparable restaurant sales grew 7.9% year over year compared with 5% in the previous quarter. Our estimate was pegged at 6.3%.\n\nCosts, Operating Highlights & Net Income\n\nDuring fourth-quarter 2023, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, came in at 29.7%, up 40 basis points year over year. Increased cost across the board, most notably beef produce as well as queso, was marginally overshadowed by menu price increases and lower paper costs.\u00a0 We suggested the metric to be 30%.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter under discussion, the restaurant-level operating margin reached 25.4%, up from 24% a year ago. The uptick was primarily driven by sales leverage. We predicted the metric to be 23.9%.\r\n\r\nAdjusted net income in the reported quarter amounted to $286.2 million, up 23.7% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $560.3 million compared with $384 million as of Dec 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, inventory totaled $39.3 million compared with $35.7 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Goodwill (as a percentage of total assets) reached 0.3% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, CMG repurchased $144.3 million worth of stock at an average price of $1,938.8.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management expects comps growth in the mid-single-digit range.\r\n\r\nCMG anticipates to open 285-315 new restaurants in 2024. It suggests 2024 tax rate in the range of 25-27%.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Chipotle has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Chipotle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nChipotle is part of the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry. Over the past month, McDonald's (MCD), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2023 more than a month ago.\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.41 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of F.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, McDonald's fair value estimate is US$272 McDonald's' US$291 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 17% lower than McDonald's' analyst price target of US$326\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$8.84b US$9.29b US$10.5b US$11.4b US$12.0b US$12.5b US$13.0b US$13.5b US$13.9b US$14.3b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x9 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.56% Est @ 4.58% Est @ 3.89% Est @ 3.41% Est @ 3.08% Est @ 2.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0%  US$8.2k US$8.0k US$8.4k US$8.4k US$8.2k US$7.9k US$7.6k US$7.3k US$7.0k US$6.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$14b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (8.0%\u2013 2.3%) = US$256b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$256b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$119b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$196b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$291, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.241. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for McDonald's\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For McDonald's, we've put together three further elements you should further research:\n\nRisks: You should be aware of the 2 warning signs for McDonald's we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.

        "content": "First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. FWRG is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 5, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 125%.\n\nEstimates\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at 4 cents, indicating an improvement of 500% from a reported loss of 1 cent per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $238.6 million, implying growth of 28.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nFirst Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nFirst Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. Quote\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the factors likely to impact the company\u2019s performance in the quarter to be reported.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nFWRG\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter top line is expected to increase from the year-ago levels, backed by same-restaurant sales growth and new restaurant openings. Recently, the company reported a business update, stating an improvement in dining room traffic.\r\n\r\nPreliminary results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 revealed a 4% uptick in same-restaurant sales compared with the previous year's level. This marked a 35.2% rise from 2019 levels. However, there was a 1.3% decline in same-restaurant traffic during the fourth quarter, albeit with a slight 0.2% increase for the entire fiscal year.\r\n\r\nIncreased focus on strategic franchise acquisitions and adjustments in menu pricing strategies are likely to have aided the company\u2019s performance in the to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for franchise revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $3.2 million compared with $2.9 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, softness in off-premises channel (due to evolving consumer behavior post-pandemic) and labor cost inflation are likely to have negatively impacted the company\u2019s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for First Watch this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that's not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: First Watch has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Both the top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, MCD reported adjusted EPS of $2.95, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81. Adjusted earnings increased 11% year over year.\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $6.4 billion missed the consensus mark of $6.5 billion. The top line rose 8% year over year. The upside was backed by menu price increases, effective marketing campaigns, and continued digital and delivery growth.

YUMC reported impressive fourth-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, YUMC reported adjusted EPS of 25 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents. The bottom line surged 92.3% from 13 cents reported a year ago.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2.5 billion outpaced the consensus mark of $2.4 billion. The top line rose 19.4% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding foreign currency translation, revenues increased 21% year over year. The upside can be attributed to net new unit contribution (12%) and same-store sales growth (4%).\r\n\r\nBrinker International, Inc. EAT reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Both the top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis. Effective marketing and pricing strategies backed the upside.

        "title": "3 Overlooked Value Stocks That Analysts Say Could Soar",
        "content": "Everyone loves a sale. That\u2019s as true in a supermarket as it is in the stock market. Consumers and investors are always on the lookout for goods, services, and equities that are fundamentally undervalued. This led us to create our list of overlooked value stocks.\n\nIt\u2019s also essentially the definition of a value stock: One that trades below levels associated with its underlying fundamentals. The reason that a given stock ends up undervalued is usually perception. the market perceives one or more confounding factors as justification for lower prices. Sometimes perception continues to match reality and in that case value stocks tend to continue to trade lower.\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t always the case and many times perception shifts and those\u00a0 previously undervalued\u00a0 shares rise in price. Multiple factors suggest that is the case of the companies discussed below. Analysts believe that these value stocks are positioned to rise in price substantially.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDarling Ingredients (DAR) Darling Ingredients (DAR) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nDarling Ingredients (NYSE:DAR) Is an excellent example of a value stock that analysts expect to soar in price moving forward. The company primarily sells animal byproducts and is a major contributor to the circular economy. As its website states, about 50% of an animal makes it to the dinner plate. The other 50% Requires innovation in order for Value to be created therefrom.\n\nDarling Ingredients is one of those innovators: the company provides collagen, gelatin for capsules, And all kinds of other animal byproducts that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nYet despite the success of the company\u00a0 and strong analyst sentiment, its stock currently only trades for approximately $43. The nine analysts currently covering darling ingredients agree on average that it\u2019s closer in value to $80.\n\nOne of the more encouraging signs suggesting that its price will increase is its P/E ratio. It currently sits below 10 but has a median value of nearly 22 over the past 10 years. The company has grown its revenues quickly over the past three years which is one reason to believe that investors will again be looking to pay more for a dollar of its earnings moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) Is one of the better known value stocks available to investors. Yet, it\u2019s also fair to argue that McDonald\u2019s remains overlooked. While it currently has modest upside per the consensus target outlook, it does have roughly 20% upside potential based on the high target price.\n\nIn order to achieve that ambitious growth Target McDonald\u2019s will need to grow. That is precisely what the company aims to do. Back in December, the company announced that it Is targeting 50,000 restaurants by 2027. In order to reach that goal, it will be entering the fastest period of development in its history.\n\nThe company intends to leverage its loyalty programs and a partnership with Google that utilizes its cloud technology.\u00a0 McDonald\u2019s is also taking aim at Starbucks through its Cosmcs beverage concept restaurants. The company is likely to increase the number of trial locations to 10 this year. Early indications are that demand is strong and the high margin drinks that the company sells certainly have the potential to produce growth at the corporate level.\u00a0If you are going to invest in any of these overlooked value stocks, start with this one.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB): shares are offering extraordinary value to investors currently. The stock collapsed throughout 2023 as the hot lithium market caved in on itself.\n\nThat said, Albemarle\u2019s fundamental situation remains strong. The company released earnings Feb. 14 That showed revenues increased by 31% throughout 2023. That led to a net income of $1.6 billion, the second highest ever in the company\u2019s history. Perhaps then it should come as no surprise that analysts agree that albemarle\u2019s shares are poised to soar in the future.\n\nHowever, sales in the fourth quarter did decline by 10%. EV sales growth is slowing, particularly in China, though not declining. However, the outlook continues to be strong. Long-term demand for lithium is positive. Yet, the Chinese economy is experiencing a broad slowdown which only complicates matters.\n\nOne reason for bullishness is the simple fact that energy firms including ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are expressing interest in the lithium industry. Albemarle is one of the easiest investments to make for those who see the value. The company is one of the largest lithium firms on the planet and absent a complete EV collapse, its future is secure. This is one of the most overlooked value stocks out there.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "15 Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities",
        "content": "In this piece, we are going to discuss upon 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities, also taking into account the urbanization dynamics globally. If you want to skip all the detailed analysis of ours, you can go directly to 5Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities.\n\nIt is projected that urban populations worldwide will increase to 80% by 2050, up from the current 55%. Global material consumption is anticipated to more than double to approximately 89 billion tonnes, as reported by the UN International Resource Panel. The wealthiest nations consume 10 times more than the poorest, with consumption rates in Asia and Africa expected to grow rapidly until 2050.\n\nDeveloping low-carbon and resource-efficient cities can help alleviate the negative effects of increased material consumption, including pollution and carbon emissions. Despite covering only 2% of the Earth's land, cities utilize over 75% of the planet's material resources. Urban expansion is forecasted to escalate global material consumption from 41.1 billion tonnes in 2010 to around 89 billion tonnes by 2050. The majority of urban growth, according to the UN, will occur in Global South cities, particularly in China, India, and Nigeria. Asia is projected to experience a significant rise in consumption due to its high concentration of megacities (cities with over 10 million inhabitants). However, the most substantial growth is anticipated in Africa over the next few decades. The continent's population is expected to double by 2050, with material consumption skyrocketing from 2 billion tonnes to 17.7 billion tonnes annually.\n\nMost countries with the lowest urban populations are situated in Africa. Despite their low urban population percentages, several of these countries are undergoing rapid urbanization. For instance, Burundi has an urban population of 14.4%, which is relatively low, but it has the world's highest urbanization rate at 5.43%. Similarly, Uganda's urban population stands at 26.2%, while its urbanization rate is 5.41%. These countries are often classified among the least developed or underdeveloped nations globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the growing population across the world, there\u2019s a direct impact on the global food market in the world. As the world's population grows and urbanizes, the consumer food industry is facing some major supply chain hurdles, price hikes, and changing consumer preferences. This situation has led to increased costs, operational disruptions, and challenges in labor and procurement. However, it has also opened up new possibilities for companies to innovate and expand by introducing fresh products and top-notch services. The global consumer-packaged foods market is worth around $1.1 trillion currently in 2024, and is expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030.\n\nAmidst this, and before we move on to our list of 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities, it\u2019s significant to see what great businesses food companies are doing all across the world. Namely, we are going to discuss PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP)\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP) is a big American company that sells food, snacks, and drinks. It's based in Harrison, New York, near Purchase. PepsiCo manages everything from making its products to getting them out there to customers. In the last quarter, they made $1.3 billion in profit, with earnings of 94 cents per share. Their sales were a bit lower than expected at $27.85 billion. This is the first time since 2020 that their sales dropped from the previous year, partly due to exchange rates and having an extra week in the prior year.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a fizzy drink made by the Coca-Cola Company. They sell their drinks all over the world, with people guzzling down more than 1.8 billion of their beverages daily in 2013. Coke is aiming for 6% to 7% organic sales growth in 2024, which is a bit higher than Pepsi's target of 4%. They're also expecting their earnings to rise faster than their revenue, which could help them maintain their strong profit margin of nearly 30% of sales.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), a big American fast-food chain, started back in 1940 in San Bernardino, California, by the McDonald brothers. It's super popular with families and kids all around the world. After experiencing some amazing sales growth for three years, McDonald's seems to be cooling down a bit. The burger giant, based in Chicago now, predicts their sales at existing locations will go up by 3% to 4% this year, which is around their usual average. This is a drop from the huge jumps they saw in 2021 and 2022, as well as the 9% growth last year. 15 Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities\n\nAn aerial view of a suburban community, with residential homes stretching into the horizon.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo create our list 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities, we referred to the urbanization rate of the countries, as provided by the World Population Review, as in 2024. For the countries with equal urbanization rates, we ranked them on the basis of total population, furthering the extent of urbanization measure of the country. Also, please note that all population figures mentioned pertain to 2024, except mentioned otherwise. With this, let\u2019s now jump to our list of Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Lebanon\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 89.40%\n\nWith a population of 5.3 million, Lebanon has faced numerous crises, including an influx of 1.5 million refugees since 2011, straining public services. Urban areas, where many refugees settle, are hit hardest. Challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, economic collapse, currency devaluation, and Beirut explosions have pushed 74% of the population into poverty. Civil unrest and protests over government corruption have worsened the situation, leading to a banking system crisis and currency devaluation. Addressing these issues is crucial, especially in urban areas where 90% of the population lives, to ensure everyone has access to basic services and rights.\n\n14. Bahrain\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 89.90%\n\nWith a population of 1.5 million people, Bahrain ranks ninth among the top destinations worldwide for expatriates thanks to its easy visa process, smooth dealings with local authorities, and hassle-free bank account setup. Bahrain took the top spot in the Expat Essentials Index, covering housing, bureaucracy, language, and digital resources. The UAE and Saudi Arabia landed second and ninth places, respectively.\n\n13. Gabon\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 91.00%\n\nWith a population of 2.5 million, Gabon has a wealth of natural resources like timber, manganese, and oil. It's the fifth biggest oil producer in Africa, which played a key role in its solid growth in the latter part of the 20th century. Currently, the oil industry makes up half of Gabon's GDP and a whopping 80% of its exports.\n\n12. Jordan\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.00%\n\nJordan has a population of 11.4 million. In Jordan, the rural population has stayed pretty low for almost 70 years, and it's been slowly decreasing since the mid-2000s, a trend that's expected to keep going. The urban population surpassed the rural one for the first time back in 1960, and it's been steadily skyrocketing ever since. This surge in urban populations is expected to continue in the coming decades.\n\n11. Japan\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.00%\n\nJapan, with a population of whopping 123 million, is super packed with people in its cities, making it one of the most urbanized places globally. Out of its 47 prefectures, only 7 have a population under 1 million. After the Tokyo earthquake in 1923, the buildings in Tokyo initially showed Western influences, but eventually, they stuck to their own design style. Tokyo and other Japanese cities expanded slowly through land readjustment, without any grand boulevards or fancy monuments. Now, Japan is kicking butt in the world of architectural design!\n\n10. Argentina\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.50%\n\nTaking up a huge chunk of land in the southern part of South America, Argentina, with a population of 46 million, boasts the second-largest economy on the continent, with a GDP around $1 trillion, as at the end of 2023. The country is blessed with abundant natural resources and excels in beef and cereal production. Argentina is a hot spot for adventure tourism and has a top-notch IT sector.\n\n9. Israel\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.90%\n\nWith a total population of 9.3 million, around 92% of Israelis reside in urban areas. Several contemporary towns and cities, merging ancient and modern elements, are constructed on historically significant sites, such as Jerusalem, Safed, Be'er Sheva, Tiberias, and Akko.\n\n8. Netherlands\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 93.20%\n\nNetherlands has a population of 17.7 million. The biggest urban bunch in the Netherlands is called Randstad, which includes the top four cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. Among these, three have been granted historical city privileges: Utrecht since 1122, Amsterdam since 1306, and Rotterdam since 1340.\n\n7. Puerto Rico\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 93.60%\n\nFor over 400 years, Puerto Rico, home to 3.3 million people, \u00a0has relied heavily on agriculture for its economy. However, changes in society and politics in the early 20th century led to a move toward industry. This shift, along with a growing population, has led to the expansion of urban areas. Even though poverty has decreased in Puerto Rico and the most poverty-stricken states over the past 50 years, Puerto Rico still faces significantly high levels of poverty compared to its historical trends and other areas.\n\n6. Uruguay\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 95.80%\n\nThe most recent census in Uruguay shows that over 95% of the population resides in cities, out of 3.4 million total population. This urban living trend has been a longstanding feature of the country and is projected to grow in the future. That's why Uruguay has decided to concentrate its National Adaptation Plan (NAP-Cities) efforts on urban areas, where essential services and key economic activities are centered. Creating a National Adaptation Plan for Cities and Infrastructures (NAP-Cities) is a fresh initiative at the national level to blend adaptation strategies into city planning and infrastructure development at both the national and local levels in Uruguay.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about the 5Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n25 Countries where Muslim Population will Increase the Most by 2030 20 States with the Oldest Population in the US 20 Countries with the Highest Homeless Population\n\nDisclosure: None. 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

In the prior-year quarter, the company reported EPS of $1.34. The rise primarily stemmed from a boost in segment profit, a reduction in general and administrative expenses and a decrease in the number of weighted-average diluted shares due to share buybacks. This was partially mitigated by elevated interest expenses and income taxes.\r\n\r\nTotal revenues in the reported quarter were $206.3 million, in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the metric declined 0.8% year over year. The decrease was mainly due to the refranchising of 69 company-operated Applebee\u2019s units in October 2022 and an unfavorable comparable same-restaurant sales growth at Applebee\u2019s. However, this was counterbalanced by the favorable comparable same-restaurants sales growth at IHOP and the inclusion of a full quarter's revenue contribution from Fuzzy's, acquired in December 2022.\n\nBrand Performances by Comps\n\nApplebee's domestic system-wide comps declined 0.5%.

        "content": "Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. RRGB reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nFollowing the announcement, the company\u2019s shares fell 12.2% during the after-hours trading session on Feb 28. Negative investor sentiments were witnessed as the company cited concerns regarding the anticipated reduction in restaurant sales and adjusted EBITDA in 2024 due to the shift back to a 52-week fiscal year and the impact of sale-leaseback transactions on rent expenses.\n\nDelving Deeper\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, Red Robin recorded an adjusted loss per share of 66 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 43 cents. The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.38 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nRed Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nRed Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Quote\n\nQuarterly revenues of $309 million beat the consensus mark of $305 million. The top line increased 6.7% year over year. The rise in revenue was primarily driven by an extra operating week (within the fourth quarter), which constituted the 53rd week of the fiscal year. This additional week contributed approximately $24.5 million to restaurant revenues.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter under review, comparable restaurant revenues fell 2.7% year over year. The downside can be attributed to the shift away from deep discounting marketing promotions. Also, the Guest count declined 7.6% during the quarter. However, this was partially offset by a 4.9% rise in guest checks. The rise in guest checks can be attributed to a 6.3% increase in menu prices and a 1% increase in discounts. This was partially offset by a 2.4% decline in the menu mix. Per our model, comparable restaurant revenues were anticipated to decline 0.5% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Results\n\nThe restaurant-level operating profit margin was 12.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter (compared with 11.3% reported in the prior-year quarter). The figure compares to our projection of 14.7%.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter, restaurant labor costs increased 14.4% year over year to $114.7 million. The figure compares to our projection of $100.3 million.\r\n\r\nOther operating costs during the quarter declined 2.4% year over year to $50.8 million. The figure compares to our projection of $54 million.\r\n\r\nAdjusted earnings before interest expenses, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) during the fiscal fourth quarter amounted to $10.6 million (compared with $8.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter). Our estimate for the metric was $16.5 million.\n\nOther Financial Information\n\nAs of Dec 1, 2023, Red Robin had cash and cash equivalents of $23.6 million compared with $48.8 million as of Dec 25, 2022. Long-term debt as of Dec 31, 2023, was $182.6 million compared with $203.2 million in the prior-year quarter.

        "content": "Investing in the stock market is a volatile journey, making it necessary to hold safe haven stocks in your portfolio. During periods of economic uncertainty, it is important to be confident in your investments.\n\nUnlike their cyclical counterparts, safe haven stocks exhibit characteristics of resilience and relative strength. This provides an extra layer of safety to protect your portfolio during market drawdowns. Additionally, these companies boast strong financial health, with a history of weathering economic storms.\n\nWhile they don\u2019t always offer the same growth as some high-flying companies during the good times, they provide a sense of stability and diversification to an investor\u2019s portfolio during the bad times.\u00a0Now, let\u2019s discuss the top 3 safe haven stocks to protect your portfolio!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is one of the best safe haven stocks to protect your portfolio in 2024. Known for specializing in consumer health and personal care products, they\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most recognized companies.\n\nProcter & Gamble boasts a vast portfolio of trusted brands and its commercial success has been evident over the last several decades. Although their revenue growth has not been spectacular in recent years, the company has maintained strong operating margins. They have averaged 66% EPS growth in the last 4 years, while generating significant FCF from operations.\n\nThe company\u2019s large moat, scale, expertise and pricing power allows them to gain an edge over their competition. Management remains committed to delivering value and balanced growth after reporting their Q2 2024 results. Operating cash flow hit $5.1 billion in the quarter, with net sales up 3% to $21.4 billion. Moreover, the company recently announced its 67th consecutive annual dividend increase demonstrating their proven ability to return cash to shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that is a leader in the warehouse club retail industry. Their unique membership model offers individuals, families and businesses access to a vast selection of quality merchandise at competitive prices. Furthermore their private label brands including Kirkland Signature are a retail favorite.\n\nCostco\u2019s membership model is a huge contributor to its success and efficient business practices. Their approach to grant members to exclusive deals at affordable prices allows them to achieve higher sales volume with low profit margins. Economies of scale works in their favor, and their loyal customer base and brand recognition continues to drive long term growth. The last 3 years have been strong, and Costco is looking to build on that momentum in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nIn FY23, revenue increased 6.7% YOY to $237 billion. Net income was $6.74 billion, or $14.16 per share. As of February 2024, Costco currently operates 874 warehouses across North America, Asia, Europe and Australia. They remain one of the largest American companies in the world by revenue, and remain well positioned for growth even in uncertain times.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp (NYSE:MCD) is easily a great stock pick for the more conservative investor. They are the largest fast food chain in the world by revenue, and have grown into a global behemoth since its founding in 1940.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has revolutionized the fast food chain experience, and has streamlined its operations and franchising capabilities. This has inevitably led to a calculated international expansion which has been extremely beneficial for their brand recognition. They currently serve more than 70 million customers per day, and their new expansion plans are looking very promising.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s closed out a strong 2023 fiscal year with strong comparable sales growth even in a tougher macroeconomic environment. Global comparable sales grew 9% YOY, and system-wide sales for loyalty members grew 45% from the year prior. EPS increased 39% to $11.56 per share, signaling MCD flip to drive profitable growth. The company plans to add 8,807 new restaurant franchises by 2027, and significantly ramp up offerings for their loyalty program. With the potential for market volatility ahead, MCD is one of the top safe haven stocks to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAs the major indexes closed in the red on Wednesday, 43 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) still managed to hit all-time highs.\n\nIn fact, record highs are piling up in 2024, with a solid 26% of all S&P 500 components (126 total) hitting at least one all-time high this year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) lives up to its hype and tops the S&P 500 in broken records \u2014 notching 23 record highs over 40 trading days this year. It's also at the top of the benchmark index when it comes to returns this year, up over 50%.\n\nBut setting aside the AI-inspired headlines, it's the Industrials sector that has the most all-time highs with nearly half of its components in the S&P 500 hitting records. It also happens to be the second-best-performing sector in February, up nearly 7%.\n\nIndustrial stalwarts like Waste Management (WM) and Caterpillar (CAT) might not have semiconductor cache, but they do have nearly 30 record highs between them. Uber Technologies (UBER), which recently replaced JetBlue (JBLU) in the Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT), buoys the sector's totals as well with 13 record highs and a return north of 25% year to date.\n\nThe top sector by performance this month \u2014 consumer discretionary, up over 7% \u2014 represents a diverse set of industries with stocks at record highs. Restaurants like Chipotle (CMG) and McDonald's (MCD), homebuilders like Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), and travel stocks like Hilton (HLT) and Booking (BKNG) all contribute to the 100-plus record highs in the sector this month.\n\nBoth the Financials and Health Care sectors each have more than one quarter of their components hitting records in 2024 and are posting the second- and third-best respective sector returns of the year. JPMorgan (JPM) has clocked a respectable eight record highs this year. But insurer Progressive (PGR) hit an overall third-best 21 record highs. Like many insurers, it was among the leaders breaking to new highs late last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough megacap in its own right, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) doesn't get Magnificent Seven headlines. But the insurer sports a market cap over a fifth bigger than Tesla. Warren Buffett's famed conglomerate is up 15% with 15 record highs this year.\n\nIn Health Care, Boston Scientific (BSX) comes in second-best to Nvidia overall with 22 record highs. The weight-loss craze is seeing Eli Lilly (LLY) up 30% this year with 16 record highs. Though this analysis surveys large-cap stocks as represented by the S&P 500, small- and mid-cap biotech stocks have also been breaking to the upside recently. See Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), which has tripled its price this month alone and hit nine record highs.\n\nThe list of sector records trails off after Health Care, with 20% of Communications Services components hitting records in 2024, followed by 18% for Materials and 13% for Energy.\n\nBut investors might sleep a little tighter knowing those scary headlines about \"market concentration\" are looking dated as the market broadens. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "On Monday, Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc (NYSE: DPZ) delivered a profit beat with its financials being fueled by its innovative \u201cemergency pizza\u201d offer. Its stock jumped as it\u00a0hiked its quarterly dividend by 25% while also announcing a $1 billion buyback.\u00a0research firm M Science reported that in December, Domino\u2019s held a 19% market share among pizza chains on the Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) Uber Eats platform.\n\nHowever, like its fast-food chain peers,\u00a0McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (NYSE: YUM), Domino\u2019s also reported it suffered an impact from the raging conflict in the Middle East. Like McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s has found itself amid U.S. brands being shunned by consumers in light of the U.S. supporting Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. At the end of January,\u00a0Domino's franchisee that operates its restaurants in Australia, Europe, and Asia\u00a0reported that same-store sales in Asia alone contracted about\u00a08.9% during the second half of 2023. McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t disclose the exact impact of boycotts on its sales, but did acknowledge the conflict created societal pressure in the countries it operates. Therefore, Domino\u2019s not alone in facing the backlash, with McDonalds, Yum Brands and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) also being among U.S. brands that some customers in the\u00a0Middle East and Asia turned their back on.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nRevenue rose 0.8% to $1.40 billion. U.S. same-store-sales grew 2.8% with international same-store-sales rose merely 0.1%, excluding currency impacts.\u00a0Domino\u2019s Pizza reported a strong performance on both sales fronts:delivery and carryout.\u00a0Its\u00a0rewards program increased by 10% and ended 2023 with 3 million active members. What\u2019s more impressive is that more than 2 million joined after the revamping of the rewards program that also boosted profit at franchises.\u00a0Domino\u2019s Pizza logged a\u00a0net income of $157.3 million, or $4.48 a share. Despite higher wages and costs related to its revamping initiative\u00a0that dented margins of its U.S. company-owned stores, lowered\u00a0food costs drove quarterly earnings per share to $4.48, topping estimates of $4.38.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber Eats partnership is paying immediate dividends.\n\nJoining hands with Uber was a wise call, one that delivered on its promise.\n\nRevamping its loyalty program did the trick and sales were revived after struggling with a slowdown in the beginning of 2023. The delivery partnership with Uber helped Domino\u2019s lure in new customers and is expected to continue doing so throughout 2024 as well.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

McDonald's Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends.

McDonald's Corp's growth rank of 9 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is favorable compared to its competitors.\n\nRevenue is the lifeblood of any company, and McDonald's Corp's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. McDonald's Corp's revenue has increased by approximately 10.80% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 75.38% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, McDonald's Corp's earnings increased by approximately 25.40% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 69.13% of global competitors.\n\nLastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 9.70%, which outperforms approximately 65.42% of global competitors.\n\nNext Steps\n\nConsidering McDonald's Corp's track record of dividend payments, consistent dividend growth rate, prudent payout ratio, strong profitability, and impressive growth metrics, the company stands out as a potentially robust dividend-paying stock.

The top increased year over year while the bottom line declined from the prior-year quarter figure.\r\n\r\nFollowing the results, shares of the company dropped 3% during trading hours on Feb 27. Negative investor sentiments were witnessed as management stated issues related to margin pressures stemming from labor cost inflation. The company expects ongoing margin challenges in the short term, particularly in the upcoming fiscal third quarter.\n\nEarnings & Revenues\n\nIn second-quarter fiscal 2024, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29. In the prior-year quarter, it reported adjusted EPS of $1.48.\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Quote\n\nQuarterly revenues of $935.4 million beat the consensus mark of $916 million. The top line inched up 0.2% year over year. The upside was primarily backed by sequential improvements in traffic. Also, guest experience enhancements and marketing optimizations added to the positives.\n\nComps Details\n\nComparable store restaurant sales increased 1.2% in the reported quarter compared with the same period in fiscal 2023. Comparable store retail sales declined 5.3% year over year. During the quarter, menu pricing increases came in at 4.8% year over year.\n\nOperating Highlights\n\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, the cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and rent) came in at $314.9 million, down 4% year over year. As a percentage of total revenues, the cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and rent) fell 130 basis points (bps) year over year to 33.7%. Per our model, the metric was anticipated at 32.7%.\r\n\r\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $52.5 million, down from $45.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Our projection for the metric was $47.4 million.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating income in the fiscal second quarter totaled $36 million, down from $55 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Our projection for the metric was $35.6 million.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating margin was 3.8%, down 70 bps from the prior-year quarter\u2019s levels. The downside was mainly due to a rise in labor and related expenditures, other operating expenses and general and administrative costs.

        "content": "By Dhwani Pandya and Praveen Paramasivam\n\nMUMBAI (Reuters) - India's western state of Maharashtra will inspect outlets of global fast-food brands to check if they use cheese alternatives in products wrongly promoted as containing real cheese, widening scrutiny beyond a crackdown on McDonald's, a top official said.\n\nThe checks threaten to cause a headache for global brands after recent inflationary pressure hit consumption of burgers and pizzas that are pricey for many Indian consumers, prompting firms to launch of discounted offerings.\n\nMcDonald's biggest India franchisee, Westlife Foodworld, has been defending its use of \"real cheese\" after media reported that state authorities last year found some products made use of so-called cheese analogues of vegetable oil, rather than real cheese.\n\nThe McDonald's franchisee disagreed with the findings, but in December it dropped the word \"cheese\" from the names of many burgers and nuggets it sells statewide, letters seen by Reuters show.\n\nIt renamed a \"corn and cheese burger\" as an \"American vegetarian burger\", for example.\n\nInspectors of the state's Food and Drug Administration will now visit all McDonald's outlets, as well as those of other major brands, to check for similar violations of display and labelling rules, its chief, Abhimanyu Kale, told Reuters.\n\n\"We are planning to check all outlets of McDonald's,\" he said. \"We will also take action on other well-known and frequently visited global fast-food chain outlets,\" he added, but declined to identify the brands being targeted.\n\nShares of Westlife plunged as much as 6.7% after the Reuters report.\n\nAnother senior state government official, who sought anonymity, said inspectors would visit Indian franchisee outlets of brands such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, Burger King and KFC.\n\nIndian state authorities have the power to suspend the licences of restaurants found to have infringed food and safety regulations in a way that misleads consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWestlife, which runs McDonald's in west and south India, will welcome any inspections and maintains the \"highest standards\", its managing director, Saurabh Kalra, said.\n\nDomino's franchisee Jubilant FoodWorks, Burger King operator Restaurant Brands Asia and Devyani International, which operates Yum Brands' Pizza Hut and KFC in India, did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\nAnother Pizza Hut operator, India's Sapphire Foods, declined comment.\n\nDevyani shares slipped on Tuesday's news to trade down 4%.\n\nIndia's western state of Maharashtra is its second most populous. Home to the financial capital Mumbai, which has about 100 McDonald's outlets, and many other urban cities, it is a key market for global fast-food brands.\n\nIn the McDonald's case, state food inspectors suspended the licence of one outlet east of Mumbai in November for allegedly using analogues in products promoted as containing cheese.\n\nThe suspension was later revoked on appeal by Westlife, the franchisee.\n\nThe company reassured many consumers online who voiced concerns about its cheese offerings, saying on social network X that it uses \"globally approved gold-standard suppliers\".\n\n\"Our cheese is made from real milk only and we do not use any substitutes or cheese analogues,\" it said on Monday.\n\n(Editing by Aditya Kalra and Clarence Fernandez)",

        "content": "Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. However, both metrics increased year over year. Following the announcement, the stock rose 5% in the pre-market trading session.\n\nEarnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nIn the quarter, Domino's reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.48, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.37. The figure rose 1.1% from $4.43 reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $1,403 million missed the consensus mark of $1,416 million, but increased 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The upside can be attributed to higher global franchise royalties and fees owing to global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) as well as higher supply-chain revenues. However, the increase was partially overshadowed by a decrease in U.S. franchise advertising revenues.\r\n\r\nIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, Domino's had 431 gross store openings and 37 gross store closures.\n\nOther Metrics\n\nGlobal retail sales (excluding foreign currency impact) rose 4.9% on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter. The upside was driven by higher international store sales (up 5.2% year over year). Meanwhile, U.S. store sales increased 4.5% year over year.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, comps at Domino\u2019s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) rose 2.8% year over year. Our model predicted the metric to increase 1.1% from the year-ago levels.\r\n\r\nAt domestic company-owned stores, Domino\u2019s comps gained 5.9% year over year compared with 3.4% a year ago. We estimated the metric to increase 2.9%.\r\n\r\nDomestic franchise store comps jumped 2.6% year over year compared with 0.8% in the prior-year quarter. Our model suggested the metric to increase 1%.\r\n\r\nComps at international stores, excluding foreign currency translation, improved 0.1% year over year compared with 2.6% in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nDomino's Pizza Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Domino's Pizza Inc Quote\n\nMargins\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, Domino\u2019s gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) year over year to 38.4%.\r\n\r\nNet income margin was 11.2%, down 20 bps from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate was pegged at 10.6%.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $114.1 million compared with $60.4 million as of Jan 1, 2023. Long-term debt (less current portion) at the fiscal fourth-quarter end was $4,934.1 million compared with $4,967.4 million at the end of Jan 1, 2023. Inventory amounted to $83 million compared with $81.6 million at the end of Jan 1, 2023.\r\n\r\nCapital expenditure in the quarter totaled $105.4 million compared with $87.2 million as of Jan 1, 2023\r\n\r\nDuring fiscal fourth quarter, the company repurchased and retired 167,572 shares for an aggregated cost of $58.2 million. As of Dec 31, 2023, DPZ stated the availability of $141.3 million under its repurchase program.\r\n\r\nManagement declared a 25% increase in cash dividend to $1.51 per share. The dividend will be paid on Mar 29, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Mar 15, 2024.\n\nLong-Term Guidance (2024-2028)\n\nThe company expects more than 7% annual global retail sales growth. It anticipates more than 1,100 annual global net store growth. DPZ expects more than 8% annual income from operation growth.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nDomino's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned +1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has gained 4.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMcDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.38 points to a change of +3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.48 indicates a change of +8.9% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, McDonald's is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.9%. The $26.96 billion and $28.67 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.8% and +6.3%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.41 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.04%. The EPS surprise was +4.98%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) has been growing nicely despite moderate unit volume gains, led by price increases. However, as consumers start to show price increase fatigue, volume growth should come more into play in the future.\n\nCompany profile\n\nCoca-Cola owns a number of beverage brands in the soft drink, sports drink, energy drink, water, coffee, tea and juice categories. Its brands include Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade, Dasani, Vitaminwater, Costa and Minute Maid, among others.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ABNB.\n\nThe company's products are sold in over 200 countries and territories. It sells its concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners, as well as finished products to wholesalers, distirbutors and retailers.\n\nOpportunities and risks\n\nCoca-Cola has long been one of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s and Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) largest holdings, most recently representing about 6.80% of the insurance giant's investment portfolio. The guru originally bought the stock back in 1988 and has held on ever since. Coca-Cola Has Seen Strong Pricing Power\n\nSo what made Coca-Cola attractive to Buffett and other investors? First and foremost, the Coke brand is one of the most recognizable brands around the globe. It is the clear leader in the soft drink category with five of the top six global soft drink brands in the world. Brands are valuable, and there are not many as big as Coca-Cola in the food and beverage space.\n\nWhile overall global unit case volume growth has been modest, up only 2% in 2023 after 5% growth in 2022, what the company has shown is a lot of pricing power. Price and mix accounted for 10% growth in 2023 and 11% in 2022. As a result, Coca-Cola has seen strong organic revenue growth the past two years of 16% and 12%. It is looking for 6% to 7% organic growth in 2024.\n\nLatin America has been an area of particular strength for the company in recent years, with unit case volumes up 6% in 2022 and 5% in 2023, and concentrate sales up 7% in 2022 and 6% in 2023. This strength continued in the fourth quarter of 2023, with unit case volumes up 4% and concentrate sales up 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola will also look to boost sales through its first new permanent soft drink flavor in quite some time. Over the past several years, it has offered some limited-edition flavors, but it recently announced Coca-Cola Spiced will become a permeant addition to its soft-drink roster to help connect with younger consumers whose tastes have shifted from older generations.\n\nThe company is also in the process of refranchising its company-owned bottling operations. The goal is to not only get cash for the deals, but to have it boost margins as well. Soda makers seem to go through phases of vertical integration and then selling off their company-owned bottlers. Coca-Cola is in the selling off phase at the moment.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the company is also eyeing its first big acquisition in years, looking to acquire healthy soda brand Poppi. The upstart beverage company recently turned heads with its first Superbowl advertisement claiming that soda will no longer be considered a dirty word. Coca-Cola has a strong track record with acquisitions, and if it acquires the company, would likely be able to accelerate the brand's growth given its huge distribution network.\n\nWhen it comes to risks, soda has certainly lost some share over the years to other beverage categories, including energy drinks and sparkling water. Soda has become linked to health issues, even diet versions, which has changed drinking habits in places like the U.S. and other areas, especially with younger generations. This should be a continued headwind in more developed markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Coca-Cola has taken a lot of price over the past few years. While it has shown pricing power, it may not be able to continue to increase prices at the same rate going forward. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), for example, has said it is seeing some backlash from its customers over prices. All in all, it seems consumers are getting fed up with the rate of price increases throughout the consumer staple space.\n\nValuation\n\nCoca-Cola's stock currently trades at 17.40 times the 2024 consensus Ebitda of $15.28 billion and 16.30 times the 2025 consensus of $16.30 billion.\n\nIt trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21 based on the 2024 consensus of $2.81 and nearly 20 times the 2025 consensus of $3.01.\n\nIt is projected to grow revenue by 0.40% this year and 4.90% in 2025. Its bottler refranchising will cut into revenue in 2024, which is why its organic revenue growth is projected to be higher.\n\nCoca-Cola trades at premium to its two soda peers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP), despite expected slower revenue growth.\n\nHistorically, over the last several years, it has traded between 17 and 22 times enterprise value/Ebitda. That would place a fair value on the stock based on 2025 Ebitda of between $62 and $81, with a midpoint of $71.50.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoca-Cola has put together some solid revenue growth the past three years coming out of the pandemic. However, with consumers starting to push back on prices caused by high inflation, volume will likely start to come more into play over the new few years.\n\nThe company will likely continue to carry a premium valuation given its brand power, but the growth of the past few years should start to slow down in the coming years. This could lead it to trade closer to the lower end of its recent historical multiple range.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Income Investors Should Know That McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon",
        "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 2 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase McDonald's' shares on or after the 29th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.67 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$6.68 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, McDonald's stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of US$297.75. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. McDonald's paid out 54% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 62% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.\n\nIt's positive to see that McDonald's's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at McDonald's, with earnings per share up 9.0% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, McDonald's has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.0% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid McDonald's? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and McDonald's paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy McDonald's today.\n\nIf you want to look further into McDonald's, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for McDonald's you should know about.\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

But it ultimately happened. And then in Shanghai and other Chinese cities. So, in addition to the disinflationary commodity and labor impacts, the third miracle for Western economies was that all the major consumer brand companies that could only expand globally within the context of what we then called the free world, could now be truly global.

        "title": "Ignore PepsiCo -- Here's a Better Stock for Passive Income",
        "content": "PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) recently gave investors some new reasons to feel cautious about the stock. While the company achieved solid sales growth this past year, demand slowed into early 2024, according to management's early February update. The consumer staples company is also projecting weaker sales trends ahead as its inflation-based price increases end.\n\nThat's unfortunate news for income investors since Pepsi and its 3% dividend yield are so popular with fans of passive income. But there's another top dividend company that looks more attractive today and pays a hefty yield of nearly 2.5%. Let's look at some reasons to buy McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) right now.\n\nSlower is OK\n\nMcDonald's shares fell in the wake of its early February earnings report, yet investors should see that drop as a chance to pick up a quality business at a discount. Sure, comparable-restaurant sales through late December slowed to 3% in the fourth quarter from 9% for the full 2023 year. The core U.S. market notched a mildly disappointing 4% increase compared to 9% in the prior quarter as well.\n\nThe chain will bounce back with some big growth avenues it can pursue this year. Its home delivery and drive-thru channels are highly popular, for example, and the chain is planning to stress its value proposition in the coming quarters to boost customer traffic back into positive territory.\n\nPepsi, on the other hand, seems much more constrained by the tough selling conditions that characterize the snacks, food, and at-home beverage niches. Investors should prefer to own stocks that have more control over their own fate, like McDonald's does.\n\nMarket-leading earnings\n\nMickey D's doesn't just have some of the highest profit margins in its industry, it is among the most profitable companies in any industry. Compare its nearly 50% operating profit margin with PepsiCo's 14%, or even with the 44% that Microsoft generates right now, and that's clear enough.\n\nStory continues MSFT Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nMost of this success can be attributed to the dividend stock's lucrative selling model that relies on royalties, rent, and franchise fees from its huge global footprint of franchisees.\n\nIt also helps that McDonald's maintains the world's most valuable fast-food brand, with all the pricing power that this asset delivers. \"We remain confident in the resilience of our business amid macro challenges that will persist in 2024,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors in mid-February.\n\nPrice and value\n\nYou'll pay a premium for McDonald's over PepsiCo and some other passive-income stocks, to be sure. Its price-to-sales ratio is over 8 compared to Pepsi's 2.5, in fact. Mickey D's also pays a more modest yield of 2.4%, while Pepsi is yielding closer to 3%.\n\nInvestors have to balance those weaknesses against the stock's clear operating advantages. McDonald's has shown it can grow through just about any selling environment. It can boost profit margins during booming consumer-spending periods and when shoppers are feeling price-sensitive. And through it all, the fast-food giant steadily hikes its dividend, as it has for nearly 50 consecutive years. That's a recipe for market-beating long-term returns for patient income investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and McDonald's wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Growth stocks tend to outperform during bull markets like the one that investors have experienced in the past year. The Nasdaq Composite, home to many of these stocks, is up a blazing 34% in 12 months, while the more diverse S&P 500 has gained 23%.\n\nYet the opportunity for generating huge returns with these stocks is even larger over the long term. That's because gains can compound over many years -- assuming a company can boost its sales footprint even as it steadily increases its earnings power.\n\nLet's look at two stellar companies that seem primed to achieve this lucrative goal.\n\n1. Buy McDonald's for profitability\n\nForever is a long time to consider holding a stock. On the other hand, McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) has been a dominant business for a long time. The fast-food giant's popular menu items, from the Big Mac to the relatively new McChicken platform, have kept consumers coming back for decades.\n\nMickey D's has had no trouble converting the popularity of those sandwiches into sales growth and rising profit margins. Comparable-store sales in 2023 increased 9% and operating income jumped 16% after adjusting for currency exchange rate swings. The company has a good shot at moving its already industry-leading profit margin toward 50% of sales in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIt hasn't all been good news for McDonald's in recent quarters, of course. Customer traffic dipped into negative territory in late 2023 as shoppers became more cautious in response to rising prices. Investors will want to watch that metric this year for a better balance between higher average spending and increased guest counts.\n\nIn the meantime, consider taking advantage of short-term pessimism on Wall Street to pick up a cheaper stock. McDonald's is valued at 8 times sales today, down from more than 9 times sales at several other points in the past year. That's a tasty discount for a blue chip giant like McDonald's.\n\n2. Buy Lululemon for strong gross margin\n\nLululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) has all the ingredients that investors prize when they're searching for stellar growth stocks. The sports apparel specialist is winning market share in a huge industry while pushing into new markets, for one. Sales last quarter were up 19% compared to Nike's flat result. Lululemon achieved some of its best growth in areas outside of its core North American division and in new demographics like men's and kids' wear.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chain is boosting sales via its online platform and with help from the launch of several new locations. Shoppers are increasingly frequenting existing stores, too, with comparable-store sales up 14% in the Q3 period (running through late October).\n\nThe best reason to like this growth stock might be Lululemon's opportunity to extend its profit margin lead over the competition in the next few years. Gross profit margin jumped to 58% of sales this past quarter even while many consumers were looking to save cash by scaling back on spending.\n\nNike, in contrast, converts less than 45% of sales into gross profit. The footwear and apparel giant recently lowered expectations for its 2024 operating trends while Lululemon boosted its outlook.\n\n\"We are pleased with our performance during the holiday season,\" CFO Meghan Frank said in a mid-quarter update.\n\nThe stock is still valued at a premium, even though shares have come down from their late-2023 highs. But growth stock investors can minimize the impact of that elevated price by extending their holding period into years and -- ideally -- decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lululemon Athletica wasn\u2019t one of them.

Some even offered unexpected twists to their strategies.\n\nThe overarching story from food companies centered on a return to normal. After a year of Ozempic fears settling in, a pullback in consumer spending amid higher prices, and a few lingering post-COVID supply chain issues, food execs were eager to move the narrative forward.\n\nBarring any further disruptions in 2024, one common theme from food companies was staying on track, Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance. \"This is the first year now in probably three or four where you're sort of operating in normalized conditions. ... So I think [they have] a lot of hope that [they're] going to be in a stable environment.\"\n\nWith the conference set to run through Friday, here are some other trends Yahoo Finance noticed on the ground.

(Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nAll eyes on volume\n\nFood execs are focused on volume recovery, as Americans have scaled back how much they're buying because of high prices.\n\nLeaders at General Mills (GIS) and Conagra were \"hesitant to comment on whether fiscal 2025 (beginning in June) could be a return to growth in line with long-term targets,\" Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer wrote in a note to clients from the event.\n\nHershey and Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) called out \"price pack architecture,\" which uses different sizes and price points, as a potential growth lever. \"We've always capitalized on having different price points, different pack sizes, so that there's accessibility for everyone,\" Hershey CEO Michele Buck said to the crowd.\n\nMeanwhile, WK Kellogg Co is taking a different approach by providing value through nutrition, an idea that CEO Gary Pilnick believes will stick around.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe go through different business cycles, we go through different fads, different nutrition demands,\" Pilnick said. \"There's something in [each of those trends] for cereal.\" Various types of Kellogg's cereals are pictured at a Ralphs grocery store in Pasadena, Calif., Aug. 3, 2015. (Mario Anzuoni/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIn the fourth quarter, WK Kellogg's revenue decreased by 2.7%, reflecting a 10% volume decline offset by price increases.\n\nPilnick explained that affordable protein sources open up a new frontier for the cereal maker, which spun off from Kellogg\u2019s snack business last year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he reiterated that cereal demand is \"durable\" as consumers\u2019 preferences change.\n\nPilnick added that a focus on nutrition also unlocks the premium market for WK Kellogg too, as shown by the company's Eat Your Mouth Off brand, a granola-like cereal that boasts plant-based protein and zero sugar.\n\nInnovating with new flavors, packaging, and marketing\n\nReimagining classics was another key strategy execs pointed to.\n\nThey held up flavor innovation as one tactic. WK Kellogg's Pilnick said the company saw success bringing back customers with new strawberry Frosted Flakes and the return of chocolate Frosted Flakes. J.M. Smucker Co.'s slide from its presentation at CAGNY 2024 teased a new flavor that will be added to the Uncrustables lineup in September. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nMeanwhile, J.M. Smucker (SJM) said it's adding raspberry Uncrustables to its lineup in September 2024 as it aims to deliver $800 million in net sales for its Uncrustables brand this fiscal year. The new flavor is part of a larger effort to lean into \"a flavor for every day of the week.\"\n\nThe company also announced its JIF peanut butter brand will launch a peanut butter and chocolate spread this summer. \"Over 70% of peanut butter buyers are not purchasing a chocolate-flavor spread today, and we anticipate this innovation will be highly incremental to the brand,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said.\n\nPackaging innovation offers another opportunity. PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has invested in updating its packaging for \u201cportion control\u201d and \u201cportability\u201d as customers snack more throughout the day. PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Luis Laguarta presents at CAGNY 2024. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that consumers can find us in many more occasions,\u201d he said. Pepsi is also leaning into powders and tablets, \u201cgiving consumers the opportunity to find Gatorade or to use Gatorade in a much different way.\u201d\n\nFood giants are also reengaging consumers through marketing campaigns with new partners.\n\nHershey, for example, excited the CAGNY conference crowd by bringing in NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal to announce a partnership to \u201cwin\u201d in the gummy segment, the fastest-growing sweets segment. Conagra Brands, meanwhile, shared that Dolly Parton's baking line is expanding into frozen shelves.\n\nCompanies are looking for partnerships beyond grocery store shelves too. They're eager to tap into the market for dining away from home, which has seen prices continue to grow.\n\nFor instance, did you know McCormick (MKC) launched a limited-time offering with McDonald's (MCD) in February for the McSpicy sandwich in the UK with Frank's RedHot sauce? Or that it teamed up with Wendy's (WEN) to launch a breakfast burrito served with Cholula hot sauce?\n\n\u201cWe're excited to continue to leverage our brands and our hot and spicy flavors to further penetrate menus and add the heat in away-from-home channels,\u201d McCormick CFO Michael Smith said.\n\nThe buzz around M&A\n\nWhile no major announcements were made, many companies teased that they're open to dealmaking but are waiting for the right company to come along.\n\nWK Kellogg's Pilnick said potential targets \"would likely be [in the] center of the food business where our brands would resonate because you'd get cost synergies.\" However, he noted that WK Kellogg is not focused on M&A right now.\n\nMondel\u0113z CEO Dirk Van de Put gave investors insight into its M&A process. The company begins by building relationships with about 30 to 40 companies, most of which are family-owned, making gaining trust on both sides crucial.\n\n\"We can't forecast the timetable, but what I can say is that the pipeline is active,\" Van de Put said. Deals are getting \u201cmore expensive because there's more interest,\" he added. \"We want to stay very disciplined.\"\n\nHowever, the next major food deal may not be a traditional acquisition.\n\nMizuho's Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance that investors could see deals similar to Walmart's acquisition of Vizio, in which \"food staples companies [acquire] differentiated tech companies\" to gain a deeper understanding of consumers.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Decoding McDonald's Corp (MCD): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "McDonald's Corp showcases robust system sales and a strong global presence, with a focus on sustainability and community impact. Investments in digital innovation and global business services are poised to drive future growth amidst competitive and regulatory challenges. McDonald's Corp's strategic outlook for 2024 emphasizes restaurant expansion, operational efficiency, and capital allocation for shareholder returns. The company's resilience is tested by geopolitical tensions, supply chain risks, and the need to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and labor market dynamics.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MCD.\n\nOn February 22, 2024, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) released its 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial performance and strategic initiatives. As the world's largest restaurant owner-operator, McDonald's reported system sales of $130 billion in 2023, demonstrating its expansive reach across 42,000 stores in 115 markets. The company's revenue streams are primarily derived from franchise royalty fees and lease payments, which constitute about 60% of its total revenue. The remaining revenue is generated from company-operated stores, which are strategically segmented into the United States, internationally operated markets, and international developmental/licensed markets. McDonald's Corp's financial tables reveal a company that is not only a leader in the quick-service restaurant industry but also one that is actively investing in its future through digital innovation and global business services, all while navigating a complex and competitive landscape. Decoding McDonald's Corp (MCD): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nGlobal Brand Recognition and Customer Loyalty: McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) boasts one of the most recognizable brands in the world, with a loyal customer base that spans across diverse demographics and geographies. The \"McDonald's\" trademark and the Golden Arches logo are considered critical assets, contributing significantly to the company's competitive advantage. The brand's strength is reflected in its ability to maintain a substantial uniform menu with geographic variations that cater to local tastes, ensuring widespread appeal and customer retention. This global brand equity is a testament to McDonald's consistent quality, service, and innovation, which have solidified its market position.\n\nStory continues\n\nFranchise Model and Financial Health: McDonald's Corp's franchise model has been a cornerstone of its success, allowing for rapid expansion and a strong, steady stream of revenue from royalty fees and lease payments. The company's financial health is underpinned by its robust balance sheet, with system sales growth contributing to a healthy operating margin in the mid-to-high 40% range. The franchise model also facilitates scalability and risk distribution, as independent franchisees bear a significant portion of the capital and operational costs.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOperational Complexity and Supply Chain Risks: Despite its strengths, McDonald's Corp faces challenges related to the complexity of its global operations and supply chain management. The company relies on numerous independent suppliers for food, packaging, and equipment, which can lead to potential disruptions and increased costs. These risks are exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, such as the war in the Middle East, which have negatively impacted systemwide sales and revenue, particularly in the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment.\n\nLabor Market Dynamics: The quick-service restaurant industry is labor-intensive, and McDonald's is not immune to the challenges of attracting and retaining a qualified workforce. The company has experienced difficulties in staffing certain restaurants adequately, which can affect service speed, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Additionally, the competitive labor market has led to increased costs associated with recruitment and retention, impacting the company's profitability.\n\nOpportunities\n\nDigital Innovation and Customer Experience Transformation: McDonald's Corp has identified significant opportunities in digital innovation and customer experience enhancement. The company's investments in technology, digital engagement, and delivery services are aimed at meeting evolving consumer preferences and improving service models. Initiatives such as mobile ordering, payment systems, and drive-thru technologies are expected to drive growth and customer loyalty, positioning McDonald's at the forefront of the digital revolution in the quick-service restaurant sector.\n\nGlobal Expansion and Market Penetration: With plans to open more than 2,100 restaurants globally in 2024, McDonald's Corp is poised to further penetrate existing markets and enter new ones. The company's strategy includes a mix of company-operated and franchised locations, with a focus on unit expansion contributing nearly 2% to systemwide sales growth. This expansion underscores McDonald's commitment to increasing its global footprint and capitalizing on emerging market opportunities.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition and Market Saturation: McDonald's Corp operates in a highly competitive informal eating out (IEO) segment, facing pressure from traditional, fast casual, and other food service competitors. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market share, as competitors may introduce new products, technologies, or consolidate, potentially impacting McDonald's sales and guest counts.\n\nRegulatory and Environmental Challenges: The company is subject to a myriad of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions it operates in. New environmental laws or regulations could increase operational costs and complexity. McDonald's commitment to sustainability, including initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support deforestation-free sourcing, is crucial in navigating these challenges and meeting stakeholder expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) presents a compelling case of a company with formidable strengths, including its global brand recognition and proven franchise model, which have underpinned its financial success. However, it must contend with operational complexities, labor market challenges, and the relentless pace of competition. The company's strategic investments in digital innovation and global expansion offer significant opportunities for growth, while regulatory pressures and environmental concerns pose ongoing threats. As McDonald's continues to adapt to an uncertain macro environment, its ability to leverage its strengths and mitigate its weaknesses will be critical in maintaining its leadership position in the quick-service restaurant industry.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "13 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best Dow Jones dividend stocks according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the Dow and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nInvestors have employed various dividend strategies over time to enhance their returns. Looking back at history, it's evident that dividend-paying stocks have often outperformed other types of investments. Opting for dividend stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can be particularly advantageous. This index comprises numerous dividend-paying stocks, notably blue-chip companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases. In 2023, the DJIA saw a significant increase of 14%, with 19 component stocks experiencing gains while 11 component stocks faced declines over the course of the year. Towards the end of the year, in December, the index reached a record-breaking high, surpassing the $37,000 mark.\n\nApart from delivering robust returns over the years, dividends have also maintained their significance as a growing component of personal income. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the proportion of personal income attributed to dividend earnings has consistently risen over time, underscoring their importance as a source of income. In 2012, dividend income accounted for 5.64% of per capita personal income in the U.S., compared to 4.39% in the previous decade and 3.51% two decades prior. Conversely, during this same period, interest income from capital markets has steadily declined, dropping to 7.39% in 2012 from 13.51% in 1992. According to the report, the total dividend income, adjusted for inflation to $2000, experienced a substantial rise from $187.6 billion in 1992 to $757 billion in 2012, marking an impressive growth of over 300%. In contrast, interest income grew by less than 100% over the same period.\n\nWhen investors consider dividend stocks for their portfolios, they often prioritize dividend yields. However, it's important to note that companies offering high yields but lacking solid financial stability could face the risk of reducing dividends, especially amidst global economic uncertainties and increasing interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies aimed at high yields should also prioritize the quality and stability of the companies in question. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks within each covered market, chosen for their consistent dividend payments and strong fundamental strength. When utilizing any income strategy, market participants typically prioritize both yield and capital gain. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their respective benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, for the period spanning from June 30, 2001, to June 30, 2023, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which assumes theoretical reinvestment of dividends, averaged 11.7% annually. This performance outpaced its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which achieved a 10.2% return over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) are some of the most prominent dividend stocks in the DJIA. In this article, we discuss some of the best dividend stocks from the Dow according to analysts. 13 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Analysts\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we started with the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and selected dividend-paying stocks from that group. We then narrowed it down to 13 dividend stocks with a projected upside potential of over 8% based on analyst price targets. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential, as of February 22. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment for these stocks. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nUpside Potential as of February 22: 8.40%\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a multinational entertainment conglomerate. It is a prominent player in the global entertainment industry, known for its diversified portfolio of brands, intellectual properties, and entertainment offerings.

On February 8, the company declared a 50% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 0.70%, as of February 22. It is among the best dividend stocks on our list from Dow.\n\nAt the end of Q4 2023, 89 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), which remained unchanged from the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is nearly $7.4 billion. With over 32.3 million shares, Trian Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.\n\n12. Verizon Communications Inc.

Such a deal would allow Trustar to pare down its stake, they said.\n\nChina is McDonald\u2019s\u2019 second-biggest market, with more than 5,500 restaurants and plans to expand to over 10,000 by 2028. Slow progress in negotiations with Trustar reflect a growing sense of caution among investors about prospects for growth in the country, the people said.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing and a potential agreement could be one or two months away, the people said. Talks could also fall apart as valuation remains a key hurdle to a deal, they said.\n\nRepresentatives for McDonald\u2019s China and Trustar declined to comment, while QIA and CIC didn\u2019t respond to queries. A Mubadala spokesperson didn\u2019t comment on the matter, but said the company is expanding its presence in Asia and has \u201ca strong pipeline of potential investments.\u201d\n\nAmid tight financing conditions and market volatility, investment firms have increasingly relied on arrangements like continuation funds as alternatives to initial public offerings or sales of their portfolio companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeep-pocketed Middle Eastern wealth funds have been eyeing assets around the world, including in Asia, as part of efforts to diversify their oil-dependent economies.

It was a weak quarter for the company, with EPS missing Wall Street's estimates, driven by looser cost controls and lower-than-expected same-store sales at its flagship Jack in the Box restaurants and Del Taco.

        "title": "Fast-food giants are feeling the burn from Middle East boycotts. Just look at McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, and Yum Brands\u2019 earnings",
        "content": "McDonald\u2019s reported a rare sales miss in its-fourth quarter earnings report earlier this month. Starbucks is forecasting slower growth for the rest of the year, even lower than what analysts predicted. And Yum Brands, parent company of Taco Bell, also reported a hit to fourth-quarter sales.\n\nWhat do these companies have in common? Besides the obvious\u2014they\u2019re fast-food proprietors\u2014these groups and others have been targeted for their perceived support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza\u2014and each company cited those protests as a material hit to earnings last quarter.\n\nSince the outbreak of the war in Gaza, anti-war activists around the world have called for an end to the conflict while pressuring companies that they claim have supported Israel or suppressed pro-Palestinian speech on social media. The war, incited by an Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 and took hundreds of hostages, has escalated into a wider campaign in Gaza that has killed 28,000 people, including 12,000 children, and drawn criticism from the United Nations\u2019 International Court of Justice, among others. President Joe Biden, widely criticized for supporting Israel, has lately called Israel's response \"over the top,\" which he followed by calling for a temporary cease-fire.\n\nBurgers aren\u2019t supposed to be political, though. Tell that to McDonald\u2019s, whose Q4 earnings report revealed that sales in its international licensed markets and corporate sector, including the Middle East, shrank to 0.7% growth, compared to 16.5% the prior year, \u201creflecting the impact of the war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIn a letter posted to LinkedIn, McDonald\u2019s president and CEO Chris Kempczinski recognized that several markets in the Middle East \u201cand some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war,\u201d and that \u201cassociated misinformation,\u201d is affecting brands like his.\n\nIn October, photos of a McDonald\u2019s franchise in Israel donating thousands of free meals to soldiers went viral, which ignited calls to boycott the chain. This moment also marked a period of declining sales in McDonald\u2019s Middle Eastern and Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s all about the franchise\n\nUnder McDonald\u2019s franchise model, individual restaurants are not strictly controlled by the parent chain and often decide things like business location, pricing, advertisements, products, hiring, and even holidays it wants to observe. The perks of this model means the parent company can have bigger access to capital, open multiple locations, and increase brand awareness with minimal supervision of the franchisee. (Ray Kroc, the man who wrested control of McDonald\u2019s from the McDonald brothers, famously said that it was secretly a real-estate company as a result of this franchise model, a story told in the ironically titled movie, \u201cThe Founder.\u201d)\n\nThe downsides of the franchise model, as the company may be seeing now, includes loss of complete brand control and increased potential for legal disputes since franchisees have a lot of control over their operations.\n\nAjai Gaur, a professor of management and global business at Rutgers, explained how a parent company \u201cdoesn\u2019t have much control\u201d over its franchises, which can also \u201cengage in social movements like charity.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if the head office could do something, what would they do?\u201d Gaur said, arguing that more transparency could help companies avoid attacks long-term. A parent company could show, for example, \u201cwhatever number of franchisees it has in Saudi Arabia, how many local people are employed there, what the business, profit, employment, and benefits are for the local community\u2014and what the costs of the boycotts are.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, he said, companies often change their presence in foreign markets during times of war\u2013two weeks after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, McDonald\u2019s, Coke, Starbucks and Netflixsuspended operations in Russia. Within a very short period, \u201ca lot of firms just sort of gave up everything there, and that obviously has financial consequences, he said.\n\nCustomers don\u2019t expect them to stay neutral, either. \u201cSociety is becoming very sensitive to what organizations do,\u201d Gaur said, \u201cand they expect organizations to go beyond profit-making machines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t build your own narrative, someone else will build the narrative for you,\u201d Gaur said.\n\nMeanwhile, Yum Brands came under fire for its investment in Israeli startups, like TicTuk, an Israeli company that allows customers to order food on social networks and message apps. On an earnings call with investors last week, the brand\u2019s CEO David Gibbs said \u201ctop line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region, with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\u201d\n\nFor Starbucks, which has also been a target of antiwar activists, sales also fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations, as revealed by its first-quarter report released last month. On the earnings call, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said the company saw \u201cnegative impact to our business in the Middle East\u201d and that \u201cevents in the Middle East also had an impact in the US, driven by misperceptions about our position.\u201d Rachel Ruggeri, Starbucks\u2019 executive vice president, added she expects the conflicts will contribute to lower earnings in the second quarter of the year.\n\nCalls to boycott Starbucks came after the company suedWorkers United, the union that represents some of its employees, for trademark infringement after the union made a social-media post stating, \u201cSolidarity with Palestine!\u201d on X. The company demanded the union group stop using its name and similar logo. According to the Associated Press, the workers put up the tweet without authorization of union leaders and it was removed after about 40 minutes. The union group responded with its own lawsuit and seeks to continue using Starbucks\u2019 name and logo.\n\nMatthew Goodman, a senior economic analyst at M Science, told Fortune that tracking the effect of a boycott is \u201cvery hard,\u201d especially because other challenges, like shifts in consumer spending, price hikes, unions, and a shaky performance of its seasonal drinks, also affects its earnings. Still, companies need to be \u201cmore proactive than ever in monitoring and managing their reputations to minimize the risk that unflattering information, whether accurate or not, leads to consumer boycotts,\u201d he said.\n\nLast December, Starbucks\u2019 stock fell by nearly 10%, a loss in value of nearly $12 billion, due to worker strikes and low foot traffic from customers.\n\nDavid Denoon, a professor that studies politics and economics at New York University, told Fortune that boycotts are \u201can increasingly effective tool of economic pressure\u201d because of social media, which allows organizers \u201cto contact millions of people whom they might not otherwise have known.\"\n\nOn TikTok, hashtags for boycotts have gotten more than 300 million views and shares, and other brands have been thrown into the fire, too. Retail clothing brand Zara became a boycott target after releasing a photo shoot in December that featured broken walls, rubble, and statues with missing limbs wrapped in white cloth, which activists called out as insensitive. The hashtag #boycottzara has more than 86 million views on the social platform.\n\nHistorically, boycotts have surprised companies by coming from all directions. Last year was rough for Bud Light, for instance, after the company\u2019s social promotion with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney led to conservatives and celebrities boycotting the brand. The company said it lost about $395 million in North American revenue in the following months.\n\nFor 35 years, consumer boycotts were the heart of the campaign to end apartheid rule in South Africa, which ultimately ended in 1990. The boycotts, which largely did not touch fast food, in line with today\u2019s patterns, ultimately caused British imports of South African textiles to fall by 35% between 1983 and 1986.\n\nMcDonald's, Starbucks and Yum Brands did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) share price is up 59% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 8.2%.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, McDonald's managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.9% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 10% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think McDonald's will grow revenue in the future.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for McDonald's the TSR over the last 5 years was 79%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nStory continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nMcDonald's provided a TSR of 11% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 12% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  McDonald's is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nWe will like McDonald's better if we see some big insider buys.

        "content": "As restaurant chains grapple with slowing traffic and wage pressures tied to inflation, BTIG Managing Director Peter Saleh and Morningstar Senior Equity Analyst Sean Dunlop join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss consumer spending pullbacks.\n\nSaleh notes that while the US consumer has shown resilience, \"not all consumers are created equal.\" Chains catering to lower-income customers will feel pressure first. However, brands like Chipotle (CMG) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) that appeal beyond just lower income groups had \"really healthy numbers.\"\n\nDunlop says two key factors are \"consumer health\" and brands being \"different operationally.\" Value-oriented names like Domino's (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) can withstand consumer cutbacks. Meanwhile, Dunlop expects outperformance from Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), and other chains boasting \"massive loyalty programs\" that offer \"personalized value\" to retain customers amid traffic declines.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith",

        "title": "FIVE, BOOT, TPX: Which Strong-Buy-Rated Retail Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "Consumers seem to be in a weird spot right now, with high-end luxury goods selling well, while some folks turn their back on McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) following their price hikes. Indeed, the consumer could continue to be mixed going into the midpoint of this year as inflation and layoffs begin to work their way into sentiment. Despite this, Wall Street still seems quite upbeat on a handful of retail stocks (such as FIVE, BOOT, and TPX), which we\u2019ll cover in this piece with some help from TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool.\n\nFive Below (NASDAQ:FIVE)\n\nFive Below isn\u2019t just another discount retailer that\u2019s capable of offering a top-notch value proposition. It\u2019s a discount retailer that\u2019s incredibly popular with the younger generations. Though inflation has essentially rendered the company\u2019s name obsolete (perhaps the firm should change its name to Five Beyond, like the section within certain stores that have goods priced at $5.00 and up), the retailer continues to offer great value on a wide range of intriguing products.\n\nYou simply cannot find many of these products at most other discount retailers. For this reason, and because of the fair price tag, I remain incredibly bullish.\n\nUndoubtedly, raising prices and bringing new, pricier goods into stores has not caused consumers to look elsewhere. If anything, the wider selection of goods has drawn in more crowds. Though I believe FiveBelow is one of the best high-growth retailers to own in a mixed economy, not all analysts are upbeat.\n\nOppenheimer\u2019s Brian Nagel recently downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy due to growth concerns and the stock\u2019s high valuation for a discount retailer. Though Mr. Nagel\u2019s concerns are warranted, I\u2019m still inclined to stick with the rest of the Wall Street crowd, most of whom remain bullish.\n\nSure, the price tag (38.4 times price-to-earnings) may be rich, but you\u2019ve got to pay a premium for the truly standout industry players. Five Below stands out as one, in my opinion. There just aren\u2019t enough locations across the nation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the firm grows its footprint, I think the firm can keep growing at an impressive pace, as it offers fun offerings (primarily toys) at affordable prices. Don\u2019t underestimate Five Below, as it\u2019s not just another dollar store.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for FIVE Stock?\n\nFive Below stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 15 Buys and four Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average FIVE stock price target of $220.53 implies 16.3% upside potential.\n\nBoot Barn (NYSE:BOOT)\n\nBoot Barn is a niche retailer that sells (you guessed it) cowboy boots, among other pieces of intriguing western wear, ranging from cowboy hats to western-style shirts to jeans and workwear. Unless there\u2019s a rodeo coming up, you\u2019re probably not going to rush over to the local Boot Barn to get a pair of cowboy boots and a hat.\n\nStill, the styles are timeless, and the company has a pretty wide moat around its corner of apparel retail. With a modest valuation (16.3 times trailing price-to-earnings), I\u2019m inclined to be bullish, as many analysts are these days.\n\nThe stock has seen decent gains over the past year, rising by around 11%. From its 2021 highs, though, Boot Barn shares remain down just north of 30%. The recent third-quarter top-line miss (sales were up just 1.1% year-over-year) and lowered guidance caused some to re-evaluate their Buy ratings. However, most analysts are confident in Boot Barn\u2019s future as the firm looks to pull up its bootstraps.\n\nThe company\u2019s long-term potential is worth getting behind, so says B. Riley Securities, which highlighted the company\u2019s dominance in the corner of western and workwear. With a wide moat and good footing ahead of a consumer recovery, it\u2019s tough to look past Boot Barn and the many bulls in the Wall Street crowd.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target on BOOT Stock?\n\nBoot Barn stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. Nonetheless, the\u00a0average BOOT stock price target of $90.69 implies just 0.1% upside potential.\n\nTempur Sealy (NYSE:TPX)\n\nTempur and Sealy are two of the biggest brands in the world of mattresses and bedding. The $8.7 billion mattress and bedding company recently broke through to new all-time highs, just north of $50 per share. Higher highs could be in the forecast as the firm looks to benefit from a healing consumer while showcasing new innovations across its bedding lineup.\n\nWith smart beds, intriguing temperature-regulating foams, and other sleep-easy innovations to win the business of sleepers, it\u2019s hard not to be bullish on the stock right here. Apart from innovative concepts, the firm has been doing a great job of staying ahead of capitalizing on the direct-to-consumer (DTC) boom with mattress-in-a-box products like Cocoon by Sealy. As far as boxed mattresses go, Cocoon certainly stands out as one of the more fully-loaded offerings out there.\n\nAlthough mattresses are an expensive discretionary purchase, I\u2019m more inclined to view them as an investment in one\u2019s health and sleep hygiene. In an increasingly health-conscious world, one has to think that Tempur Sealy is in a spot to rise up on the back of a growing industry, with ExplodingTopics forecasting a 5.9% compound annual growth rate for the global mattress market from 2024 to 2030.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target on TPX Stock?\n\nTempur Sealy stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with five Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average TPX stock price target of $58.08 implies 14.8% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe consumer may be doing okay, but that ultimately depends on who you ask. Moving into year\u2019s end, I\u2019d look for the following retail plays to make up for lost time as market strength keeps working its way into consumer sentiment. Of the trio presented in this piece, analysts expect the most upside (16.3%) from Five Below.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Analysis: Restaurant Brands is cooking up a turnaround at Burger King for investors",
        "content": "Toss some lighter fluid on the performance of the flame-grilling, Whopper-focused Burger King.\n\nAfter years of misfires, it appears Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is finally turning the corner at its most iconic brand, amid a series of investments.\n\nMoments after the company capped off an investor day at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, Restaurant Brands CEO Josh Kobza told Yahoo Finance Live that BK's comeback is real \u2014 and better operations are a huge ingredient.\n\nThe proof of the turn is in the special sauce \u2014 or results \u2014 of the company's latest quarter.\n\nBurger King US saw a 6.4% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter, compared to a 5% increase a year ago. The Whopper maker also boasted an increase in customers for the first time since Q2 2021.\n\nFor all of 2023, Burger King's US same-store sales rose 7.5%, versus a mere 2.2% gain the year prior. Perhaps more importantly, Burger King US grew its franchisee profitability by nearly 50% as underperforming restaurants were closed and traffic trends improved. A sign advertising the soy-based Impossible Whopper is seen outside a Burger King in New York, Aug. 8, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/REUTERS/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nExecs credit the improvement at BK to several factors.\n\nFirst, aggressive marketing efforts around new menu items such as the Royal Crispy Wrap. The company also launched a catchy campaign this month to award a contestant $1 million for creating the next take on the Whopper.\n\nSecondly, early benefits from millions of dollars being spent to support remodeled, more futuristic-looking restaurants.\n\nAnd lastly, less discounting on the famed Whopper.\n\nCollectively, the initiatives are referred to internally as Reclaim the Flame.\n\n\"The strong performance in BK\u2019s franchisee profitability (up ~46% [year over year]) validates our hypothesis that the Reclaim the Flame acceleration is gaining momentum,\"Bernstein analystDanilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBurger King is Restaurant Brands' largest chain in the US at 6,778 locations, followed by Popeyes and Firehouse Subs. The franchise is also the largest for the company overseas at 12,240 sites, far ahead of Tim Horton's, with 1,308 locations in its home market of Canada.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a sign of confidence, Restaurant Brands announced in mid-January it would buy Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST) for about $1 billion in cash. Carrols owns about 1,022 Burger King restaurants across 23 states, as well as 60 Popeyes stores.\n\nOwnership of Carrols should allow Restaurant Brands to more directly invest in important initiatives such as remodels, Restaurant Brands executive chairman Patrick Doyle told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nThe quarterly results from Burger King US come as the company noted sales gains across its portfolio.\n\nDespite the progress, Restaurant Brands shares have continued to underperform the broader market. Over the past year, its shares are up 14%, compared to a 23% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nWall Street would like to see several boxes checked by Restaurant Brands before getting more bullish, Gargiulo says.\n\nThat includes picking up the pace of growth overseas and improving BK's performance in the key market of China.\n\nAnother factor is uncertainty on the speed of Burger King's remodels in the US, \"with the shift in Reclaim the Flame budget from remodels to refresh potentially signaling lower appetite from franchisees to remodel,\" Gargiulo added.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "30 Unhappiest Countries In The World",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 30 unhappiest countries in the world. If you want to skip out an introduction to what might make an individual happy or sad, then skip ahead to 10 Unhappiest Countries in the World.\n\nThe pursuit of happiness stands as a universal aspiration. However, for millions across the globe, this pursuit remains elusive, overshadowed by the harsh realities of poverty, political instability, and societal challenges. In this article, we look into the 30 unhappiest countries in the world and understand the factors that contribute to the pervasive sense of unhappiness among their populations.\n\nIt's important to remember that happiness or unhappiness are very subjective so it is not very simple to determine a single metric to measure it; however, there are certain needs essential to all humans that help make this process easier. The World Happiness Report, published annually by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, provides valuable insights into the subjective well-being of nations based on factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.\n\nOne of the main reasons why people in some countries are unhappier than others is because of poverty. According to the World Bank, over 70% of the population in countries like Zimbabwe and Madagascar live below the national poverty line. Economic hardship deprives individuals of basic necessities, perpetuating a cycle of despair and hopelessness. In Zimbabwe, for example, the poverty rate was estimated at 70.1% in 2019, contributing to widespread dissatisfaction and discontent among its citizens.\n\nUnfavourable economic climate leads to political instability, which is another prominent reason that adds to unhappiness, fostering an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and despair. In Afghanistan, ongoing conflict and insurgency have led to widespread displacement and suffering, with over 54% of the population living below the poverty line. Afghanistan also ranks among the lowest in the world on the Global Peace Index, 2023, with a score of 3.644 out of 5, which highlights the pervasive impact of conflict on the well-being of its people.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe political instability, economic crisis, and disputes over nationalization policies contributed to Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\u2019s, a major multinational oil and gas corporation, decision to significantly reduce its operations in Venezuela. As a result, the company's production and investments in the country declined, impacting its presence in the Venezuelan oil industry. In 2007, the Venezuelan government nationalized the assets of several foreign oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).\n\nThis move led to a dispute between Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and the Venezuelan government over compensation for the expropriated assets. In 2012, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled in favor of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), ordering Venezuela to pay the company over $900 million in compensation.\n\nSimilarly, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), the iconic fast-food chain, operated in Somalia until the early 1990s. However, the outbreak of civil war and the collapse of the central government in 1991 led to a deteriorating security situation and the disintegration of law and order. The lack of infrastructure, regulatory framework, and basic services further compounded the difficulties faced by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) to operate in Somalia.\n\nAccording to the World Happiness Report, countries like Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Haiti consistently rank among the lowest in terms of subjective well-being indicators. Additionally, data from reputable sources such as the World Bank, United Nations, and international humanitarian organizations offer insights into the socio-economic factors that justify the unhappiness of these countries. 30 Unhappiest Countries In The World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 30 unhappiest countries in the world we have considered our own rankings of the poorest countries in the world and countries with the highest depression rates.

        "title": "Fast-food chains are the worst offenders when it comes to child-labor violations\u2014and it\u2019s not even close",
        "content": "While most people aren\u2019t looking, state politicians are debating how young the youngest in our workforce should be.\n\n\u201cHow young is too young to be a child worker\u201d is unfortunately a question we\u2019re still debating in the 21st century. And Republican- and Democratic-governed states have different visions of this\u2014vastly different.\n\nThough the concept is nothing new, it\u2019s gaining steam and poised to potentially become a permanent feature of the economy of the 2020s. \u201cChild labor remains a key issue in state houses across the country in 2024,\u201d Nina Mast, state economic analyst for the progressive, union-affiliated think tank Economic Policy Institute, told Fortune. \u201cWhile the industry-backed movement to weaken child-labor protections continues to make progress, lawmakers and advocates for youth are fighting back in an increasing number of states.\u201d\n\nMast is alluding to her think tank\u2019s research showing that one particular industry overwhelmingly benefits from ambiguities in the federal laws governing child labor, to which many red states have responded by loosening regulations and lowering age limits.\n\nThat one industry is fast food.\n\nThis past January alone, eight states \u201cintroduced or took new actions\u201d on proposed legislation that would reduce child-labor protections, per EPI research. These proposed laws involve children working more hours without breaks (and longer during their school weeks), clocking into factory or roofing jobs with dangerous conditions, or even looking after other children younger than themselves \u201cwithout direct supervision.\u201d\n\nSince 2021, there have been attempts at legislation in 28 states to pierce holes in child-labor protections. As of 2024, 14 states have introduced counter legislation made to bolster child-labor protections, per EPI. This is at times contradictory, with the same states trying to introduce laws that roll back and bolster child-labor protections.\n\nEven the jobs that don\u2019t necessarily violate the law are targeting a vulnerable group. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore that\u2014as a result of longstanding exemptions in US labor law\u2014agriculture is the deadliest industry for young workers (accounting for over half of work-related fatalities even though it employs a small share of children), though they may not be employed in violation of child labor laws,\u201d Mast said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe minimum guidelines for youth employment were set decades ago, in 1938, as part of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Even so, many of the current policies on child and teen labor remain contested state by state as FLSA doesn\u2019t cover everything like the hours older teens can work, or the permits needed for certain jobs.\n\nMany of the new laws regarding child labor, Mast says, are focused on \u201cincreasing penalties, mandating workers\u2019 rights education, and expanding the legal remedies available to victims of illegal child labor.\u201d And Mast notes there\u2019s a \u201cconcerning trend\u201d of young employees working in treacherous jobs such as roofing and meatpacking.\n\nAs sectors like the childcare industry grapple with shortages due to insufficient pay and grueling hours, politicians turn to the children themselves. Many of the fields where teens have traditionally been employed are dealing with staffing issues.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the field that had some of the highest turnover during the Great Resignation is also the largest employer of youth: Leisure and hospitality hires the most children, outpacing all other industries, Mast told Fortune, and within hospitality it's restaurants, and within restaurant's it's fast food. As Mast's analysis says: \"Child labor violations in the food industry, most often in the form of hours violations for 14-15 year-olds, have skyrocketed over the past ten years and have been driven by restaurants that operate on a franchise model.\"\n\nIndustrial times or not, America still runs on child labor\n\nFamed fast-food companies like McDonald\u2019s and Popeyes have come under fire recently, representing a larger surge in the field\u2019s violation of child-labor laws by making teens work more extended days and operate hazardous kitchen equipment.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, McDonald's told Fortune that its 2,000-plus network of franchisees, operating as independent small business owners, make their own hiring decisions on their restaurant teams. It also noted the large scope of people employed both by the company and franchisees\u2014over 800,000 people at nearly 14,000 restaurants.\n\nFor its part, McDonald's said it \"provides ongoing training opportunities and resources \u2013 such as recommended best practices around hiring, scheduling and restaurant safety \u2013 to help franchisees ensure compliance with minor labor laws\" and said it takes every Department of Labor violation seriously.\n\n\"We do not believe these complaints reflect the experience of the vast majority of teenage crew members, who are working at McDonald\u2019s restaurants in age-appropriate roles and looking for meaningful jobs in their local communities,\" the company said.\n\nPopeye's did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhen introducing a law that would loosen federal protections by extending work hours for teenaged workers ages 14 to 15, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said the following: \u201cIf a teen can participate in a basketball game until 9 p.m. on a school night, they should also have the option to work a part-time job if they want to.\u201d What Johnson doesn\u2019t mention is that these jobs can be taxing, involve low pay, require working hours way past 9 p.m. on a weekday, and bear dangerous conditions not even close to said intramural sports.\n\nOutsourcing labor to a vulnerable group also has potential effects on the rights of the workforce as a whole. The mentality is: Why pay an adult what they\u2019re worth if you can get a desperate child to do the job cheaper?\n\n\u201cThe consequences are potentially disastrous,\u201d Reid Maki, director of the Child Labor Coalition, told the Associated Press. \u201cYou can\u2019t balance a perceived labor shortage on the backs of teen workers.\u201d\n\nDuring a time of high inflation, Americans have embraced their reputation for loving fast food, turning even more to the relatively cheap fries-and-burger combo. Dining out and going out is not just more expensive, it\u2019s also more socially taxing as many people continue to prefer more solitary habits long after the lockdown was first issued four years ago. Perhaps our pandemic-fueled introversion and inflation-era budgeting have only added fire to the fast-food industry. But while we lean more on these chains, they lean more on children, the not-so-secret purveyors of your next milkshakes.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 most meat eating states per capita. If you are not interested in learning about the US meat industry, head straight to the 5 Most Meat Eating States Per Capita.\n\nIn the United States, dietary habits vary significantly from state to state, and one intriguing aspect is meat consumption. Some states like Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Missouri, among others, stand out for their per capita meat consumption, reflecting cultural preferences, agricultural traditions, and economic factors. Understanding meat consumption patterns across different states provides valuable insights into regional food cultures and their impact on health, the environment, and the economy.\n\nThe Evolving Dynamics of the Meat Industry\n\nThe worldwide meat industry is experiencing significant growth, with market value expected to surge from $897.5 billion in 2021 to over $1.3 trillion by 2027. In the United States alone, projections indicate a 4.39% growth from 2024 to 2028, resulting in a market volume of $157.10 billion in 2028. Notably, multinational giants like Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), Cargill, Inc., and Smithfield Foods, Inc. are actively pursuing new product developments, mergers, and acquisitions to solidify their positions in the market.\n\nDespite this growth, there's a subtle shift in consumption patterns within the U.S. Meat consumption, a significant dietary component, has fluctuated. While the average U.S. resident consumes 224.6 pounds of meat annually, indicating a historical rise compared to 1970, recent years have witnessed a slight decline in meat sales. Overall meat sales by volume in U.S. groceries have dipped by 4% year-over-year and 6% over the past two years, signaling changing consumer behaviors.\n\nWhen examining per capita meat consumption in the U.S., it's evident that beef holds a prominent position, with the average person consuming 82 pounds annually, well above the global average of 19.8 pounds per year. However, this decline in meat consumption has spurred a wave of disruptions in the industry, prompting the emergence of alternative products.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting Dynamics in the USA Meat Market and Global Consumption Patterns\n\nThe meat market in the USA is experiencing significant shifts in consumer preferences, influencing market trends and consumption patterns. According to the Power of Meat study, consumers' focus on value, product quality, and animal welfare drives purchasing patterns. The study also highlights that higher prices and increased meals at home have led to a sales record for meat, with dollar sales reaching $81.8 billion in 2022, despite a 5.6% decline in volume compared to 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the willingness to pay a premium for high-grade, grass-fed, and locally-grown meat products reflects the growing demand for differentiated and specialty meat products. Furthermore, there is a rising focus on organic and natural meat products and grass-fed and free-range options, indicating a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.\n\nIn the US beef market, consumer preferences drive remarkable growth, with an increasing demand for specific attributes such as grass-fed and organic beef, which has led to a significant shift in production practices, marketing strategies, and product offerings in the beef industry. The market is expected to achieve a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.12% between 2022 and 2027, translating into a substantial increase in market size.\n\nThe Economic Research Service of the USDA emphasizes that changes in consumer preferences, relative prices, and available leisure time drive the allocation of meat budgets between beef, chicken, and pork. US consumers' substituting poultry meat for beef is the most significant change in meat consumption patterns over the past 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, on a global scale, meat consumption has been steadily increasing, with certain countries showing rapid growth rates. Factors such as population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes in developing countries have contributed to this trend. While developed countries like Germany, the United States, and Japan rank among the top meat consumers, developing nations often have lower per capita consumption rates. As of 2023, 72% of the global meat industry revenue comes from fresh meat, 26.2% from processed meat, and 1.8% from meat substitutes. Companies like Hormel Foods Corporation, Beyond Meat, Inc., and The Kroger Co. are among the key players capitalizing on the expanding meat industry.\n\nKey Players in the Meat Industry\n\nTyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN), one of the world's largest food companies specializing in protein products, reported an anticipated total adjusted operating income of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, with expected flat sales compared to fiscal 2023. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) aims to address challenges and improve market conditions by focusing on operational efficiency and restructuring, particularly in its Chicken business.\n\nMarket watchers closely monitor Tyson's financial results, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal year 2024 predicting earnings of $2.26 per share and revenue of $52.6 billion. The upcoming earnings report on February 5, 2024, is expected to show a year-over-year decline in earnings per share but an increase in net sales.\n\nIn the United States, Cargill Meat Solutions, a privately held Cargill Incorporated subsidiary based in Kansas, leads the industry in revenue. With an annual income of $165 billion in 2022 and a workforce of 165,000 employees, Cargill Meat Solutions plays a significant role in the meat sector.\n\nQuick service restaurants (QSRs) like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) also wield substantial influence in the meat industry. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) alone purchases 0.861 million tons of beef annually, serving billions of burgers worldwide through its 38,000 locations in Chicago, Illinois.  20 Most Meat Eating States Per Capita\n\nConstantine Pankin/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn our methodology, we ranked the most meat-eating states by using total beef production as a proxy for meat consumption. This decision was based on the understanding that there is no readily available data specifically on meat consumption by state. Through a study, we found that midwestern states tend to consume the most meat in the US. Therefore, we utilized beef production by state as a reliable indicator of meat consumption levels. Our analysis revealed that midwestern states were among the top beef producers, further validating our chosen proxy measure. We then assigned scores to these states, defining the states with the highest consumption.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Tennessee\n\nTotal Score: 0.4\n\nTennessee stands thirteenth among the most meat eating states per capita. Studies on goat meat consumption and expenditure patterns in Knox County offer some insights, but comprehensive recent data on overall meat consumption still needs to be included. However, Tennessee's agricultural sector plays a significant role in meat production and consumption. The state's farm income and wealth statistics reflect its agricultural prominence, encompassing the production of various agricultural commodities, including meat products.\n\n12. Iowa\n\nTotal Score: 0.45\n\nIowa is a critical player in the meat industry, particularly in pork production, boasting the first rank in hog inventory in the U.S. according to the 2022 Iowa Agricultural Statistics. The state's meat processing sector thrives, providing nearly 29,000 jobs. The 2020 Iowa Pork Industry Report underscores Iowa's importance in pork production and its impact on meat consumption, noting an increase in per capita pork consumption since 2014. Moreover, a study by Jayson Lusk highlights Iowa's high meat demand, with consumers favoring meat options 1% more often than the national average, solidifying its position among states with substantial meat consumption.\n\n11. Arkansas\n\nTotal Score: 0.5\n\nArkansas stands out as a significant producer and consumer of meat, particularly beef, pork, and poultry. Pork production in Arkansas exceeds $80 million annually, with over 1.8 million pigs produced yearly. Agriculturally, Arkansas is dominant, contributing around $16 billion to the state's economy annually. Per capita consumption of poultry and livestock in Arkansas remains consistently high, reflecting the state's robust meat-eating culture.\n\n10. North Dakota\n\nTotal Score: 0.55\n\nNorth Dakota emerges as a prominent meat-producing state in the U.S., primarily focusing on beef production. With approximately 1.85 million beef cattle, the state boasts nearly 2.5 cattle per person. Meat production, especially beef, is pivotal in North Dakota's agricultural sector. Financially, the state's meat exports have surged to record highs, attributed to free trade agreements (FTAs). These exports not only bolster North Dakota's economy but also underscore the robustness of the meat industry within the state.\n\n9. Florida\n\nTotal Score: 0.6\n\nFlorida, a significant meat-consuming state in the U.S., prefers beef and poultry. The presence of 1.63 million cattle and calves on farms and ranches as of January 1, 2022, underscores the state's substantial livestock for meat production. Florida's meat consumption mirrors the national trend, with the average American consuming 327.8 lbs of meat annually, with chicken being the most-consumed type.\n\n8. Kentucky\n\nTotal Score: 0.65\n\nKentucky is one of the top meat consuming states in America, with a particular emphasis on beef. The state ranks 8th in the nation in beef cattle inventory and boasts the most beef cattle of any state east of the Mississippi River, totaling about 1,033,000 head. In 2022, gross receipts from cattle production reached $1.1 billion. Kentucky's broiler production has been steadily increasing, contributing to the state's meat consumption, where Americans consume about 81 pounds of chicken per person annually.\n\nFinancially, data from the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service highlights Kentucky's substantial agriculture sector, with 895,000 cattle and cows in inventory and 1,910,000 cattle, including calves. Additionally, the state produced 254,400,000 chickens (broilers), reflecting the meat industry's significant contribution to Kentucky's agricultural economy.\n\n7. Montana\n\nTotal Score: 0.7\n\nMontana is renowned for its high consumption of red meat, particularly beef, driven by its strong ranching tradition and large cattle population. Studies reveal that Montana residents consume more red meat than anywhere else in the country, with an average intake of steaks and burgers three to four days a week. Financially, local food production in Montana sustains 1,110 jobs and contributes $77 million to the local food market. Although Montana's agricultural economy is valued at over $4 billion, only 3% of the food consumed in the state is produced locally, down from 70% in the 1950s, highlighting a significant gap between production and local consumption.\n\n6. Kansas\n\nTotal Score: 0.75\n\nKansas stands sixth among the most\u00a0meat-producing state in the U.S., notably renowned for its beef industry. As of January 1, 2023, the state housed 6.25 million cattle, over twice its human population. Cattle and calves contributed 46% of Kansas' agricultural cash receipts in 2021, generating $9.85 billion. Kansas produced nearly 6.2 billion pounds of red meat in 2020, about 11% of the nation's total. The beef industry significantly impacts the state's economy, with an estimated direct output of $8.9 billion and 42,761 jobs, totaling $15.6 billion in production and 66,789 jobs.\n\nClick to see and continue reading the 5 Most Meat Eating States Per Capita.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n25 Countries That Eat The Most Meat Per Capita Heading Into 2024. 16 Biggest Lab Grown Meat Companies in 2023. 10 Best Plant-Based Meat Companies to Buy.\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Restaurant Brands International, Inc. QSR reported fourth-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nFollowing the results, the company\u2019s shares dropped 4.5% during trading hours on Feb 13. Negative investor sentiments were witnessed as management cited concerns about an uncertain operating environment because of inflationary pressures, foreign exchange volatility, rising interest rates and general softening in the consumer environment (impacted by the conflict in the Middle East).\n\nEarnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nIn the quarter under review, QSR reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 75 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. The bottom line increased 4.5% from 72 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nQuarterly net revenues of $1.82 billion beat the consensus mark of $1.8 billion. The top line increased 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was driven by strong system-wide sales growth and the passing on of elevated commodity prices to franchisees. On a reported basis, this was partially offset by unfavorable FX movements.\n\nRestaurant Brands International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Restaurant Brands International Inc.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Josh.\n\nStory continues\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm so excited for what is ahead of us at Krispy Kreme. Our strategy is clear to make our fresh doughnuts available in more places and keep reminding people of the joy that is Krispy Kreme, but a treat to share and give to others. We made great progress on this in 2023, with strong consumer demand and increased access to our fresh doughnuts in both existing and new markets around the world. We also improved profitability as we grew, demonstrating the productivity benefits of our unique hub-and-spoke operating model.\r\nAs we move forward in 2024, we will continue to offer new and exciting specialty premium doughnuts, upgrade of digital commerce capabilities, and expand the availability of our doughnuts around the world, including in our newest sales channels like club stores and quick service restaurants. We will also increase our efforts to modernize the making and moving of doughnuts to ensure we deliver high-quality profitable growth.\r\nLet me summarize today's key messages. We continued to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth, with all markets and channels growing sales. We expanded profit margins by leveraging existing production hubs to support our growth, especially in the US, where operating leverage was strongest. Our ongoing strategy is to scale the business efficiently, providing more fresh points of access. There are now more than 14,100 places where you can buy our melt-in-your-mouth fresh doughnuts in 39 countries. Our focus on operating excellence means that we're building both a bigger and better Krispy Kreme business. And finally, we are introducing our 2024 outlook, with organic growth expected to translate into adjusted EBITDA expansion, reflecting our intent to drive increasingly profitable growth.\r\nWe delivered 13.2% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, ahead of our guide, and 12.2% organic revenue growth for the full year. This performance reflected strong consumer demand, with people choosing to celebrate Halloween, Thanksgiving, and the holiday season with premiums-priced specialty doughnuts from Krispy Kreme, including a Scooby Doo dozen and our first-ever Elf doughnut collection, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the family-favorite holiday movie.\r\nTimes like this help create tremendous excitement for the brand in 2023. And we finished the year with over 40 billion media impressions, reflecting how well Krispy Kreme's fresh and innovative doughnuts resonated with the consumer. E-commerce also continues to play a bigger role within our business, growing over 25% in the fourth quarter, driven by new loyalty members, which now total over 15 million, as well as operational improvements to our website, app, and in-shop availability.\r\nOrganic growth was also driven by adding new points of access, which increased by 743, a much stronger fourth-quarter expansion than in prior years, reflecting the growing demand from existing and new partners who want to make everybody's favorite fresh doughnuts available to their customers. The same goes for new countries, with Krispy Kreme opening in Ecuador and France in the fourth quarter, to add to Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Chile, and Costa Rica, which were all added earlier in the year.\r\nThe continued expansion of our hub-and-spoke model delivered productivity growth and increased profitability in the fourth quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margin improving 40 basis points to 14.2%. The hub-and-spoke model is becoming more productive as we add more points of access without adding significantly more production hubs. We ended 2023 with 2,300 more points of access than in 2022, mostly to deliver fresh daily displays in grocery and convenience stores. And we did this whilst adding net one production hub. The resulting increased utilization of our production hubs, most of which can still make twice as many doughnuts as they do today, made them more efficient and profitable. We also completed the optimization of our production hubs without spokes in 2023, closing legacy doughnuts shops which were not well suited to the strategy.\r\nOur fourth-quarter and full-year results exemplify the success and power of a hub-and-spoke model. And in 2024, I look forward to us becoming a bigger and better Krispy Kreme by continuously improving our business operations as we grow. And the number one reason why someone may not buy a Krispy Kreme doughnut continues to be access and convenience. We've more than 2 million locations where we could in theory sell Krispy Kreme, at least in the markets we've targeted. The opportunity to expand availability is big.\r\nWe have previously shared our long-term goal of opening at least 75,000 points of access around the world, yet this still represents less than 3% of the total addressable market. And we are adding new customers all the time, such as Costco in international markets and McDonald's in the US, where we have been conducting an extended test in Kentucky for much of 2023. Our relationship with McDonald's remains strong, with discussions ongoing about further expansion, and we look forward to providing updates on our quick service restaurant plans through 2024. We also expect to launch Krispy Kreme in three to five new countries in 2024, with several priority markets identified in Europe as well as Brazil, where we just announced an exciting new partnership with the convenience store chain AmPm.\r\nWe have perfected the art of making our original glazed doughnut over the last 87 years and bringing joy to our consumers across the world. Yet there remains the opportunity to modernize the way we make and move our doughnuts, bringing efficiency to the process whilst maintaining consistent high quality and service levels.\r\nWe have started 2024 by making changes to our global leadership team to reflect these opportunities. In Angela Yochem, we are adding a new Chief Information Officer with deep digital technology experience across multiple industries. Our Global Supply Chain Leader, Sherif Riad, formerly of Mondelez, has stepped into the team, as our US Business Leader, Javier Ranca\u00f1o, who has extensive QSR operations experience. As a leadership team, we are focused on quality fresh doughnuts in every channel every day, expanding the use of automated doughnut making and processing, and continuously improving our doughnut delivery capabilities as we support more and more points of access.\r\nAn example of this is a pilot we are just starting on select routes in LA. and DC to deliver our fresh doughnuts through a third-party logistics provider, still using dedicated Krispy Kreme trucks and drivers. As we focus on our core strategy of producing, selling, and distributing first doughnuts daily, we continue our [strategic view of insomnia cookies]. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremiah to give further insight on our financial performance and provide an outlook for 2024.\n\nJeremiah Ashukian\n\nThanks, Josh, and good morning and strong double digit fourth quarter organic growth and improved profitability for the year, demonstrating the productivity benefits of a hub-and-spoke model. In the fourth quarter, we grew double digits on both the top and bottom line on a percentage basis, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 40 basis points year-over-year to 14.2% is our growth in all our markets, driven by high impact global brand activations of seasonal offerings, increased points of access and premiumization efforts. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14.7%, outpacing our revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter as we continue to realize cost efficiencies occur. The global business. Increased utilization been performed largely in line with expectations as we delivered 12.2% organic growth, increased adjusted EBITDA by 11% and expanded margins.\r\nOrganic growth accelerated to 13.2% in the fourth quarter. Notably, we saw growth across all our segments in 2023 on top of strong performance in 2022. In US segment, organic revenue grew 13.7% in the fourth quarter, driven by record holiday season, especially Donna offerings drove incremental sales through all channels, especially DFT and have positive impact on our sales. We also observed increased transaction values did a growth of our e-commerce channel. All of this was underpinned by our strategy of growing points of access, which grew 17.7% year over year with more than 300 DFT doors added in Q4 versus Q3 and over 1,000 doors added versus 2022 and insomnia cookies, we observe strong organic growth of 16.3% as well as sequential margin improvement from Q3.\r\nThat said, margins in the business remain pressured given the elevated cost of cocoa. The hub-and-spoke model first established in the UK and Australia is now well underway in the US for several cities seen marked improvements in profitability during the year as we added more points of access to the existing hubs. This as well as our ability to leverage pricing to offset inflation, explains the increase in sales for hub of 8.9% year over year. And the subsequent 120 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for the year.\r\nIn the international segment, organic revenue grew 9% year over year as we expanded points of access and leverage global campaigns over the holiday season to drive volume of our specialty doughnuts. Most notably, we executed our health specialty dominance in nine markets worldwide, leveraging a single set of mark materials seen great results, Mexico and the UK. Mexico was a substantial contributor to growth this quarter. We have nearly doubled points of access in Mexico through existing partners, such as OXO with meaningful room to continue expanding in the country. We also saw successful growth and new partners such as Costco in Australia, which continues to prove to be inefficient.\r\nCustomer adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially in the quarter to 20.6%, with margin expansion in both Australia and Mexico. Profitability continues to be pressured in the UK, and we're taking actions to improve productivity in the market development segment, organic revenue grew 19.2% in the fourth quarter as we continue our international expansion by opening 126 more points of access or a combination of theaters, fresh shops and DFT doors.\r\nWe opened two new markets Ecuador in France and expect that these to come trees alone can support one and 2000 further points of access. Most notably, Paris represented a record-breaking launch in the fourth quarter. The shop was our best performing shop worldwide on a sales basis in December.\r\nMarket development adjusted EBITDA grew 21.1% in the fourth quarter, with margins expanding by 120 basis points to 35.4%. Margin improvements were primarily driven by continued hub-and-spoke efficiencies in our equity on Japanese and Canadian markets.\r\nAs we continue to expand globally, we expect to see high returns and international franchises, JV structure of the French market as a prime example of our Capital Light model approach, which enables earnings flow through at significant margins for providing the option to take equity ownership of the market in the future.\r\nAs you heard from Josh earlier, we announced our future entry into Brazil using a similar approach for the year ending 2023. We delivered $0.27 and adjusted earnings per share, driven by improvements in adjusted EBITDA that were offset by higher than expected depreciation and amortization. As we continue to accelerate expansion both domestically and globally. It adds some near cookies and may choice for investments in anticipation of accelerated growth in the USDFD. business.\r\nWe also saw increased annual interest expense as a result of the higher interest rate environment. As a result, we saw adjusted diluted earnings per share finished lower than our original expectations. Our business fundamentals remain strong. We are confident in our ability to grow EPS despite remaining in the somewhat higher interest rate environment in 2024.\r\nIn 2023, we deployed some of our operating cash flow to strategically reduce our use of vendor financing, which had an impact on net cash from operations. Over the year, we reduced vendor financing by roughly $82 million, which provide a long-term tailwind of $3 million to $5 million on an annualized basis to adjusted EBITDA beginning in mid 2024. Despite these efforts, we are able to hold leverage flat through 2023, finishing the year at 4.1 times.\r\nWe have a healthy balance sheet having extended our maturity 2023. We closed the year with just under $40 million in cash and have access to ample liquidity through our revolver with an undrawn capacity of $150. We remain focused on the long-term health of the business and setting up our capital structure to support growth through a strong balance sheet. We expect to deliver in 2024, primarily to the growth of adjusted EBITDA and running the business with an eye towards efficiency and capital expenditures as well as managing working capital over the long term, we remain on track to be between 2.0 times and 2.5 times net leverage in 2026.\r\nAs we look forward to 2024 for providing our outlook for the full year, which assumes a nominal offerings, including insomnia cookies. For the full year 2024, we expect to deliver net revenue growth of 5% to 7%, organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% to 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $0.27 and $0.31. After reporting strong double digit fourth-quarter and full-year organic growth in excess of our full year guide.\r\nWe remain confident in our 2024 guidance and our ability to drive operating leverage as we become more coordinated as a global company, we believe well positioned for sustainable, high-quality growth in the years to come, leveraging the tools, which helped us deliver a great finish to the year in 2023. As it relates to the first quarter, despite the harsh weather and broad parts of the US in January and lapping record-breaking sales in the first quarter of 2023 to 4%, we also expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in line with revenue growth. We will closely monitor and adapt to changes in the market and consumer environment, and I remain confident about the profitable growth potential of our business in 2024, and we're excited for a great year to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Josh for his closing remarks.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nThanks, Jeremiah. In summary, we are expanding availability by adding high-quality productive points of access, driving operating leverage to the efficiency of our operating model, and maximizing capital return both by leveraging existing capacity, and making selective investments in geographies which have limited access to Krispy Kreme today. All in, I look forward to us building a bigger and better Krispy Kreme in the years ahead. Operator, let's now open it up to Q&A, please.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Sara Senatore, Bank of America.\n\nHi, good morning, this is Jessica (inaudible), on for Sara Senatore. Thank you. So for last quarter, you said you had an advance quesitons about expanding the McDonald's partnership and were making investments in the US, but it looks like though, 160 or so restaurants testing for doughnuts have been unchanged since 3Q. And I know that the test release alluded to more growth in the quick service restaurant channel, but I want to see if there's any more color you could provide on that agreement. And I do have a couple more questions, but after that, I can ask them one at a time.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nSure. Good morning, Jessica. Yeah. Obviously, word is out in the success of our Delivered Fresh Daily doughnut program, several customer opportunities in existing and new channels around the world. Regarding quick service restaurants in the US, our focus does continue to be on McDonald's. Discussions are ongoing and productive about an expanded partnership. And we'll provide an update on that one when we have it. Okay. What was your second question?\n\nSo in the US and international markets, revenue growth was slightly less than points of access growth. I know you think in terms of growth in sales perhaps, but as we tried to forecast sales going forward, how should we think about new footprints of access? Is it fair to assume that now have lower volumes than the 16 basis points of access? And also is that driven by the time of door? And will that change if the accelerated expansion into the quick service industry was interesting.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nObviously the three international markets, the UK, Australia and Mexico and different situations. The UK Australia, much more developed in the grocery store customer mix in Mexico really really starting out with a big opportunity in in convenience stores and see you get a constant mix affect. The underlying performance is good on that you're going to get these mix effects for for the forecasting, especially in Mexico with the opportunity with the OXO convenience store chain.\n\nOkay. Thank you. And could you remind us how much of your commodity basket you have locked in?\n\nJeremiah Ashukian\n\nYes, and I can take that, Jessica. And we started to put on cover on commodities early or in 2023. We do expect to see mid to high single digit inflation overall for 2024 from most of our commodities are now covered. About 75% of them are covered that off commodities that we actually can cover some as it made sense for us from a pricing perspective or just the security of supply perspective from a bit of a mixed bag within that kind of high single digit, mid to high-single digit inflation number amongst our cost structure, as we're forecasting inflation in excess of 20% on things like sugar, where the market remains around 10-year highs and low double digit inflation on things like cartons, which is a commodity we can hedge. But we do expect to see some deflation on key commodities like we and edible oils. I think it's important to note out just outside of commodities from a labor perspective, we do believe that will be subject to the wage increases in California. And as a result, we continue to expect to see high single digit to low double digit inflation on labor in 2024.\n\nOkay. Thank you so much for your time.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nJohn Ivankoe, JPMorgan.\n\nLuke Jobe\n\nHey, team. This is Luke Jobe, on for John Ivankoe. Just wondering if you could give some language around specific changes to the current process or model that were that were focused on was specification to modernization of the dynamic in process and kind of especially delivery within the within. Thanks.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nSure. Thanks, Luke. I'll take that and get you picks up on our efforts to modernize the way we made a move. All our doughnuts, like goes all the way from the sort of digitization of the process through to the automation of the doughnut making itself. And then overlay onto upskilling our donor transportation all in, we're working to ensure the freshest doughnuts every time delivered as efficiently as possible.\r\nWe shared before the automation efforts. We have a line running in New York, which is now automatically feeling top paying and even packing the doughnuts, we're looking to perfectt that and then roll it out in time down. And then regarding the logistics, in particular, the rapid expansion of DFD. means that we're becoming more logistics becoming more and more important.\r\nSo we announced in today's call that we have a pilot covering select routes and DC. and LA. in that study are expected to take about four to six months. And the purpose of that has to work with a third party providers and see if we can maintain quality and service whilst being able to access new capabilities that they can bring and over time, improve our operations and indeed bring more efficiency. So it's an effort end to end to continuously improve doughnut, making a moving and I will provide updates as we learn more.\n\nLuke Jobe\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nBill Chappell, Truist.\n\nHi, good morning. This is Davis [Holcombe] on for Bill Chappell. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to know, as we saw that your guidance this year for fiscal year '24 includes operations for the iPhone via cookies, but we are or where do you know if you could provide a little bit of color on what the sales guide would be without the inclusion of insomnia equities?\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nYes. I mean, number one, we're pleased with the performance of insomnia as the business continues to grow profitably and improve from sequentially. In terms of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA improvement from we opened a record number of because the vagaries in 2023. We also talked about the growth rate at insolvent at 16.3% on the earnings call as well. Um, there continues to be lots of some opportunity on this business to expand both the US internationally. And we do expect it to continue to grow double digit in 2024. But just given the fact that we're in the process, as we said in Q3, we're conducting a strategic review and look forward to sharing more news about it that we can. I think in the last earnings call, I did let everybody know that we operate or the impact on insomnia would have a roughly 100 to 200 basis point impact on the top line.\n\nExcellent. Thanks for the color. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nAisling Grueninger, Piper Sandler.\n\nAisling Grueninger\n\nHey, good morning. So CapEx came in as a percentage of revenue for it for 2023 at 7.2% and the new 2024 outlook, you're targeting seven to eight. We're just wondering how concrete of a number that is, does that include any incremental investments you would need to make if let's say, a QSR partnership was to come to fruition in 2024.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nYes, good morning, handling and so on. Our confidence in the DFT opportunity around the world and especially in the US, including QSR and such that we have thoughtfully started making additional investments in manufacturing capacity to support it. For example, we've secured new sites in Miami and Twin Cities and L.A. are all conversions of existing buildings looking to accelerate time to opening to keep up with with demand. And to clarify, though, the investments we're making there in broad support of the expansion DSD overall. So they're not dependent specifically, for example, on McDonald's, but the investments that we very much believe and make a lot of sense for our business going forward and in terms of bringing Krispy Kreme to more people in those in those new channels.\n\nAisling Grueninger\n\nGreat. Thanks for that. And my second question is on, I think we touched on this before, but it's been Slide 18 of your presentation. It's about average revenue per door per week for international. Just what's the dynamics behind? It's been the decrease year over year is it just opening the CFD. doors and less prime locations than the earlier locations? Or just any color would help things?\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nYes, it's a great question. Apds internationally were impacted in '22 by the UK regulations that were put in place that's called HFSS., which required us to move where the locations were in the stores, which had an immediate step down in terms of productivity on moving forward. The APD. per door has been impacted by adding more convenience type locations, but Josh mentioned around play around places like OXO in Mexico, which on average is smaller footprint, which would be a lower kind of dollar per door. So overall, the mix effect there will have a prolonged we believe the APD. will remain fairly flattish internationally kind of moving forward.\n\nJeremiah Ashukian\n\nIt's I think, a clarifying on the US because actually interesting with APD.s growing strongly we're seeing that we're actually bringing on even more productive new customers and locations. I'm showing that there is a lot of whitespace opportunity in the US And it's interesting international Mexico as an example, where we are leaning in on convenience store in the US is a lot of grocery stores, mass club stores, for example, big opportunities there. So the APT will evolve over time with different types of customers. But all in, we're seeing app continuously productive doors are ones that support our margin expansion plans.\n\nAisling Grueninger\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for that. I'll pass it back.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you again. The floor is now open for your questions. To ask a question, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Glenn Glenn though with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Guglielmo\n\nThank you for taking my questions. And just going back to the US expansion of hubs. You mentioned Minnesota, California, Florida, and I think New England and upstate New York were also opportunities. So just thinking through kind of those, are there certain areas you see as priorities right now. And are there certain markets that you need to get opened before doing like a national QSR rollout?\n\nJeremiah Ashukian\n\nWell, it is a rollout with a customer like for example, MacDonald and 13,000, 14,000 restaurants in the US, we can cover about 6,000 restaurants just with our existing network.\r\nSo your question goes to the seven or 8,000, assuming you're taking McDonald's is the benchmark that we would need to cover in areas where mostly it's in those areas you described in the country where Krispy Kreme isn't today we our plans are anyway over time to open up in those in those places and reference to either on Miami, these L.A., New England, all the ones you referenced, upstate New York or they're all in our plans. And naturally those that we have already maxed out capacity or we've identified sites to the ones we're prioritizing in the short term.\r\nBut they all make sense for us. And so we're actually looking across the country and in all those locations. And as we as we build out our plans for DSD and QSR in the future.\n\nDan Guglielmo\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up to that kind of like a modeling question, just around the CapEx spend. So 7% to 8% of revenue guidance for 2024. I'm just thinking about the expansion, and I think you had said $3 million to $6 million for some of those hubs. Is there a cadence we should be thinking about quarter to quarter for the year? Is it going to be pretty evenly spread throughout Com or should it be back-weighted? I'm just trying to get some help there. Thank you. On the CapEx is I mean the hubs themselves are coming online, probably a little more back-weighted than the CapEx itself, though phases different. It doesn't, Jeremiah?\n\nJeremiah Ashukian\n\nAnd yes, I mean, there's a cash flow from CapEx that will happen here because we spent or at least and decided to deploy capital last year in an effort to retire up and running earlier in the year, some from a modeling perspective, I mean, for the most part, we will follow us fairly uniform spend of CapEx throughout the year as we have in previous years. So it's a fairly consistent number. When you think about a percentage of revenue that will bounce between 7% and 8% for the quarters, it will just bounce up and down between those numbers more or less.\n\nDan Guglielmo\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with CL King. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Wolf\n\nThanks. Good morning. First, I wanted to ask about the first quarter sales being low in a low trend and tie that to the year because obviously you're looking for a big rebound to more like 6% to 8% to get to the 5% to 7% for the year for the for the Q2 through Q4, a little more in line with what May were. I think the Street was expecting. So could you just kind of flesh out a little bit what you're seeing in the quarter? How much you think is pure weather? Is there anything else going on? Do you have sort of non-weather impacted markets either in the US or Canada and even the other segments that sort of point to sort of some more normalized growth supporting the rebound for the rest of the year?\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nYes, I think, Jeremiah, can I can take that? I think I'll probably start off by just saying we're actually pleased with the fact and we'll continue to have to post growth in Q1 after a record Q1 in 2023, 14 consecutive quarters of organic growth as the last time, it didn't grow in the quarter was during COVID. And as a result of some of the UK shutdown or slowdown, that organic growth in the quarter is actually close to 3% to 6% given we'll be lapping the discontinuation of BSTM., as you mentioned, like many others, we saw harsh weather in broad parts of the US in January, leading to lower revenues and a softer start to the year and which also comes up against the comp of 14.4% last year, but also a couple of one-offs to your point and one that insomnia cookies, we have a lap against extended delivery zones that will be in our base, which provided some tailwind last year. And then to a market developed we had a one one-off shift in the timing of some equipment sales in our market development franchise business, which resulted in a higher sales being recognized in 1Q last year. That said, we're excited for Valentine's Day tomorrow, which is one of our biggest sales days of the year, not to mention other key specialty done on offerings over the course of the year. We're definitely committed to disciplined growth in pursuit of the full year guide that I laid out. And we will when you think about from a cadence point of view, lap some other things as we get into Q2 that may go the other way, most notably the MCR outage that we had in the US in Q2 2023, which will help us kind of recover back in Q2.\n\nJeremiah Ashukian\n\nAs I say I'll add is we're looking we're looking forward to quality sustained growth through through 2024 and Q4 showed once again, the consumer just loves our doughnuts, especially for sharing gifting and special occasions and celebrations like Valentines, as Jeremy mentioned, even when priced at a premium. And we see that in all all sales channels with really quite phenomenal growth recently and in e-commerce in particular. So our consumers engaging with the brand more than ever, and that's that's the US and they are the key backdrop to understanding Krispy Kreme.\n\nAndrew Wolf\n\nOkay. And if I can just add another follow-up. Just related also to sales. I assume for the year you only have the 160 or so McDonald's stores in there, um, but I guess for the US and specifically, is there any less some of a of a push on sales in any way whether it's not putting up stores, you might have put hubs that you might have put up because you're deferring. And is there any impact on yours? What's in the guidance because you're kind of throttling any part of the US operations back in anticipation of either McDonald's or another QSR?\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nThere's no, there's no throttling back, and it's absolutely the case that the DFD. continues to be a core driver of our growth. And indeed, as I mentioned a moment ago that the queue for additional doors around the world, including the US at a time which has traditionally been problematic for our customers, they want to put it in other seasonal items for this year. They wanted to put in our items and prioritized lifting new doors for Krispy Kreme. So So definitely, no, no throttling back at the same time, we are very focused on improving the quality of our operations, ensuring high quality sustainable growth working, as I mentioned, on making moving doughnuts and continuously better ways. So that naturally means we're very thoughtful as we grow to make sure we have the best points of access and strong hubs, making sure they're set up for future growth.\r\nAs also mentioned, you know, with many of the doughnut shop still heavily underutilized, Ray will make more than twice the market dominance they do today, most of those lines and getting ready for for growth with QSR and other new channels, is it a lift. And so we're making sure that everywhere we grow. It's in a way that ensures high quality doughnuts presented Freshley's consumer in every channel whilst maintaining productivity and efficiency. So yes, we're certainly working hard on the system, but we're not as such throttling back.\n\nAndrew Wolf\n\nThank you. That's really helpful color. I'll pass it on.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nThanks. You bet.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the call over to Josh Charlesworth for closing remarks.\n\nJosh Charlesworth\n\nWell, thank you, everybody. Thank you for your interest in Krispy Kreme today. And of course, thank you to all our Krispy Kreme's for their hard work in 2023 and your ongoing commitment to bring joy to our customers through Krispy Kreme.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

What fed-up customers have been calling \u201cMcFlation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s not right here,\u201d one TikToker user said in a video about the hash brown price hike. \u201cI\u2019m still gonna eat it, but it\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nMcFlation extends to the rest of McDonald\u2019s products: Despite having a Dollar Menu, there\u2019s no food items on it that cost under $1.

And last month, an X post about an $18 Big Mac meal went viral and sparked debate about the chain\u2019s steep prices.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is feeling the heat from upset customers. It reported global same-store sales growth of 3.4% in its 2023 fourth quarter, falling short of its expected 4.79% increase. U.S. sales growth likewise disappointed, reaching 4.3%, still under the estimated 4.45%.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski alluded to high prices as a reason why the company missed sales expectations for the first time in four years.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re going to see as you head into 2024 is probably more attention to what I would describe as affordability,\u201d Kempczinski said in the earnings call.\n\nHe admitted that for customers making $45,000 annually, it\u2019s cheaper to just stay home and cook.\n\n\u201cThe battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer,\u201d Kempczinski said.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMcFlation is going strong after two decades\n\nMcDonald\u2019s may want to win the battle with customers seeking affordable meals, but its history of raising prices suggests the company started the war itself.\n\nIn 2008, McDonald\u2019s disgraced its dollar menu, raising the price of the double cheeseburger to $1.19 and replacing the dollar version of the cheeseburger with an inferior McDouble \u2014 a product with one slice of cheese instead of two.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2008, costs of food considerably increased, necessitating the price hike. Burger buns were 24% more expensive, and cheese costs rose 6.6%. At the time, the menu change sparked similar controversy to today. The dollar menu accounted for 14% of McDonald\u2019s sales.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We've seen an uptake in a number of restaurants that are enjoying a lot of success because of their value offerings,\" Harry Balzer, a restaurant industry analyst at the NPD Group, told ABC at the time. \"Right now, consumers are clearly looking for a deal, and those that are offering one that is new and noticeable are winning.\"\n\nBut perhaps the greatest touchstone for measuring McDonald\u2019s inflation \u2014 so iconic that its price is used to measure purchasing power parity between currencies \u2014 is through its iconic, eponymous Big Mac. Once $2.36 in 1996, the burger cost $5.69 as of December 2023, almost doubling in price.\n\nBurgernomics says the U.S. dollar is strong, a result of inflation, which failed to dip below 3% last month, according to a Labor Department report on Tuesday. More broadly, the consumer price index for food away from home rose 5.1% over 2023, and the index for limited-service meals, which includes fast food, rose 5.8%. That\u2019s compared to the food-at-home index of 1.2%, which indicates a nationwide trend in fast-food prices soaring compared to grocery prices.\n\nMcFlation is everyone\u2019s McProblem\n\nDespite complaints over consistent price increases in McDonald\u2019s products, the inflation problem isn\u2019t unique to them.\n\n\u201cWhat's going on at McDonald's is part of a larger scene out there,\u201d Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research, told Fortune.\n\nWendy\u2019s story over the past two years has mirrored McDonald\u2019s: In August 2022, the company reported lower-than-expected sales, which it attributed to lower-income customers preferring to eat at home versus going out. Burger King was similarly hit with inflation in 2022, planning to cut their 10-piece chicken nugget meal down to an eight-piece meal. (However, the company bounced back at the end of 2023, reporting a same-store sales increase of 6.3%.) Yum Brands, parent company to KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, reported underwhelming 2023 fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nKalinowski said that as for McDonald\u2019s, the company will likely address price hikes, but not with lower prices. Customers can expect to see modest price increases, but with more targeted discounting through app promotions. Customers are more informed than ever before and perfectly capable of finding good deals.\n\n\u201cIf you're looking to maximize your food dollar as much as possible and still want to use restaurants in some way, shape, or form, you can find deals out there,\u201d Kalinowski said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 highest yielding dividend stocks in the Dow. You can skip our detailed analysis of high dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow.\n\nDividend yield holds significant importance in dividend investing, serving as a key metric for investors. Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.\n\nHeartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities. Employing a strategy known as the 'Dogs of the Dow', investors focus on acquiring the highest-yielding stocks within the DJIA. The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually. However, when assessing the period from the end of 2003 to 2018, the Dogs of the Dow were actually outperforming the S&P 500 by approximately 1% each year.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) are some of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow among others that are discussed below in this article. 13 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow\n\nPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified dividend-paying stocks from this selection.

        "title": "7 Stable Dividend Stocks to Ease Lingering Market Jitters",
        "content": "Easily one of the top talking points of last year is that with the economy avoiding a recession, mitigation protocols \u2013 such as targeting stable dividend stocks \u2013 seem rather unnecessary. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t hurt to hope for the best but to be prepared for the worst.\n\nFor starters, there\u2019s really no market cycle that warrant extreme pessimism for stable dividend stocks. No, these industry stalwarts probably won\u2019t make you rich \u2013 they\u2019re just too boring and predictable for that endeavor. However, this very profile makes such ideas so effective against any market jitters or ambiguities. Over time, you have the confidence that these blue chips will make their way back top.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s not guaranteed that the economy will continue producing gangbuster metrics. At some point, the market has to ebb and flow, which means it\u2019s never a bad idea to be diversified. On that note, the below stable dividend stocks should help ease any lingering concerns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nRepresenting the biggest fast-food enterprise in the world, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) also doubles as a symbol of American capitalism. However, the Golden Arches failed to feel the love when it released its latest earnings report. As Barron\u2019s pointed out, the fast-food giant\u2019s latest financial disclosure took a little shine off MCD stock. Nevertheless, the op-ed argues that the red ink created an opportunity for discount-seeking investors.\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. Fundamentally, I appreciate the company experimenting with a new business model with the CosMc\u2019s chain. As I wrote for TipRanks, CosMc\u2019s focuses on the drive-thru model that emphasizes convenience. More importantly, the initiative targets Generation Z, specifically this age cohort\u2019s penchant for personalization.\n\nGiven that this is the emerging generation, MCD represents a winner among stable dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the passive income, it\u2019s not a blistering forward yield at 2.31%. However, the main point here is that McDonald\u2019s commands 48 years of consecutive dividend increases. Therefore, it\u2019s so close to becoming a dividend king.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nA multinational consumer goods company, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) specializes in a wide range of personal health, hygiene, and care products. To be sure, P&G doesn\u2019t particularly resonate as a powerfully compelling enterprise \u2013 unless we have another toilet-paper-draining pandemic again. However, the main driver for the enterprise as a candidate for stable dividend stocks is the underlying everyday necessity.\n\nJust because a recession suddenly materializes doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll stop using personal care products. Additionally, P&G carries the clear advantage of selling primarily low-cost products. If family budgets are going to be slashed, the focus will turn to the discretionary items: vacation plans, beverages from pricey coffee shops and streaming subscriptions that have gone dormant (except to ping your account every month).\n\nRegarding passive income, P&G isn\u2019t astonishingly generous with a forward yield of 2.39%. That said, this dividend isn\u2019t going anywhere, with the company printing 68 years of payout increases. Given the tremendous trust factor, PG easily qualifies for stable dividend stocks.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most popular big-box retailers in the country, Target (NYSE:TGT) incurred some rough moments. As I mentioned in May of last year, Target sounded a warning regarding the impact of retail crime. Back then, the company Chair and CEO Brian Cornell disclosed that the business could see profitability shrink by more than $500 million compared to the prior year.\n\nNot surprisingly, investors quickly rushed to the exits. And that panic later subsided into a gradual erosion of market value. However, after Target posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, TGT stock came alive. With more people having more jobs \u2013 thanks to a blistering labor market \u2013 Target\u2019s business should steadily recover.\n\nFurther, while crime imposes a dark cloud over retail, it\u2019s also possible that political leaders will get the hint. They can either crack down on crime or suffer tax revenue losses as companies pull out. With circumstances finally improving, investors should be able to trust Target\u2019s forward yield of 3%.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget its 53 years of payout increases. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the stable dividend stocks to buy.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational pharmaceutical and medical technologies company, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has long played a significant role among stable dividend stocks. Last year, J&J spun off its consumer health products unit, which became Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE). Personally, I can go with either one. However, with the former enterprise focused on groundbreaking medical innovations, it offers much value for investors.\n\nFirst, the global pharmaceutical manufacturing market reached a valuation of $516.48 billion in 2022, per Grand View Research. Experts project that the sector could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.63% to 2030. At the end of the forecast period, the industry could print revenue of $929.9 billion.\n\nAs for the medical technologies space, Statista notes that the arena could expand at a CAGR of 5.23% from 2024 to 2028. At the culmination point, the market volume could rise to $748.2 billion.\n\nRegarding the dividend, J&J offers a forward yield of 3.04%. Notably, the payout ratio sits at only 43.28%. Best of all, the company commands 62 years of payout increases.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nA soft-drink manufacturing icon and another symbol of American capitalism, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) intrigues as one of the stable dividend stocks. It\u2019s a bit risky to say that ahead of its fiscal Q1 2024 earnings report. However, if history is any guide, stakeholders shouldn\u2019t fret that much. Since at least Q1 2022, the company has been on a roll, beating its earnings targets.\n\nAdmittedly, where Coca-Cola sometimes gets a bit shaky is in the revenue department. For example, in fiscal Q2 2022, its sales reached $5.72 billion, shy of the $5.8 billion consensus. Also, the soft-drink manufacturer fell short in Q4 2023. Still, the overall picture represents one of reliability. Consumers still love the underlying products: they\u2019re cheap, accessible and provide a pick-me-up.\n\nInvestors can also receive a sugar high from the passive income. Presently, the Coca-Cola offers a forward yield of 3.09%. Even better, it commands a history of 62 years of consecutive payout increases. Therefore, KO easily ranks among the stable dividend stocks to buy.\n\nSempra Energy (SRE) The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile utility giant Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) may not have as illustrious a history as many of the stable dividend stocks on this list, SRE still deserves careful consideration. Providing power resources to large swathes of the lucrative Southern California market, Sempra isn\u2019t going anywhere. No matter how many political criticisms fly at the Golden State, they don\u2019t land.\n\nYou want to know why? For one thing, California is a coastal state, reaching out to the vast expanses of the Pacific. Second, it borders Mexico, which again despite the political criticisms represents a key economic partner to the U.S. Third, the temperate climate \u2013 for the most part \u2013 makes it an attractive destination spot for Americans and immigrants abroad.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s no surprise that Sempra offers a forward yield of 3.42% along with a track record of 20 years of consecutive payouts. As well, the payout ratio sits at 46.21%, a reasonable metric. Finally, SRE brings capital gains potential to the table with a strong buy rating forecast shares to $81.39.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a hydrocarbon energy giant \u2013 and a controversial one historically \u2013 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) might not seem compelling as one of the stable dividend stocks. After all, the political and ideological forces that govern the world seem to speak with one accord: electric vehicles are the future, deal with it. Okay, I added the last part but that snideness seems to capture the mood.\n\nWell, folks in Chicago might beg to differ. With extreme winter conditions leaving many EV owners stranded, the idea that the future is here might not resonate well. Plus, the world continues to run on oil and may do so for some time. Yes, EVs are gaining significant ground but they\u2019re still expensive compared to their combustion-powered counterparts.\n\nFrankly, the likelihood we\u2019ll see of at least some EV drivers returning back to combustion won\u2019t help matters regarding electrification. But this dynamic should be a boon for XOM stock and its ilk.\n\nTurning to passive income, Exxon prints a forward yield of 3.73%. It also sports a low payout ratio of 39.61%. And if doubts exist about the company\u2019s viability, a 41-year history of consecutive payout increases should put them to rest.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "At the end of the trading hours of February 12, McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) stock sat at $289.44. The price range for the stock in the preceding 52 weeks fluctuated between a high of $302.39 and a low of $245.73.\n\nMcDonald's currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share, equating to an annualized dividend of $6.68 per share and giving its stock a yield of about 2.31% based on the stock's closing price on February 12.\n\nHow Can You Earn $1,000 Per Month As A McDonald\u2019s Investor?\n\nAssuming your earnings target is $1,000 per month or $12,000 annually from McDonald's dividends, you would need to invest approximately $519,481, which is 1,795 shares at $289.44 each. However, if you opt for an earning target of $200 per month, the estimated investment value reduces to $103,896 or 359 shares.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. How to earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A Landlord\n\nDetermining your estimated investment value using dividend yields: You can calculate an estimated value of investments using two key parameters. One is your desired annual earnings target \u2014 $12,000 or $2,400 \u2014 and the second is the stock yield, which is 2.31% in this case). So, $12,000 / 0.0231 = $519,481 to generate an income of $1,000 per month, and $2,400 / 0.0231 = $103,896 for $200 per month.\n\nThe dividend yield of a stock can be calculated by dividing its annual dividend payouts by the current price of the stock. However, it is important to note that a stock\u2019s dividend yield may change because of fluctuations in stock prices. As the stock price may affect its yield, any changes in the dividend policies can also impact the yield.\n\nConsidering that the stock price remains unchanged, its dividend yield will rise when the payout increases and vice versa. This is an indicator of the positive correlation between a stock's dividend yield and the payouts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays a $2 annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).\n\nDisclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on February 12 using an annualized dividend. The price of McDonald\u2019s stock at the end of trading on February 12 was $289.44.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.  Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

        "title": "Inflation: Cost of eating out continues to rise, a potential hit to restaurant chains",
        "content": "More Americans will be thinking twice before they say yes to a fancy dinner out on the town.\n\nThe cost of dining out in January was up 5.1% year over year, and up 0.5% compared to the previous month. On the other hand, the cost of groceries has moderated, with a 1.2% increase compared to last year, and up 0.7% compared to December.\n\n\"Historically, when commodity inflation runs ahead of labor inflation, grocery pricing pushes ahead of restaurants,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in client note. \"When labor inflation runs ahead of commodity inflation, restaurant prices tend to outpace grocery pricing.\"\n\nLabor is a key pressure point this year, as 22 states raised their minimum wages on Jan.1, while Oregon, Nevada, and Florida are set to increase theirs later this year.\n\nAnd California is facing a looming wage jump as a result of the FAST Act. Beginning in April, food chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide will be required to raise their minimum wage for restaurant employees to $20 per hour.\n\nAs the bill rises, some customers will likely pull back on restaurant visits in favor of cooking at home. \"You're going to see greater pivot at that lower income level,\" Tower told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\n\nThis is already putting pressure on brands like McDonald's (MCD). In its Q3 earnings call last week, CEO Chris Kempczinski called it a \"battleground\" to get the attention of the low-income consumer.\n\n\"There's some transaction size reduction\" and \"some trade down\" among the demographic, he said.\n\nOthers with higher exposure to low-income consumers include Wendy's (WEN), Domino's (DPZ), and Taco Bell (YUM), per Citi's analysis.\n\nChili's parent company Brinker International (EAT) has also been trying to adjust to changing consumer sentiments. \"We're seeing improved responsiveness to TV ads that showcase really sharp value,\" CEO Kevin Hochman said in a call with investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut customers who come in for deals aren't \"buying as much alcohol or desserts,\" he said. The company is planning to use promotions like $6 margaritas to boost traffic.\n\nMore discounts could be coming. If foot traffic broadly \"does not improve from this point forward,\" companies will have to offer better deals, said Tower, or lean into categories that may be not as inflationary, like fries or chicken over beef.\n\nWhile Starbucks tends to skew a higher-income demographic, some of its customer base is changing their spending habits as well. The coffee chain's US foot traffic was up a mere 1% in its latest quarter, while the check size went up 4%.\n\nBoth numbers were under analysts' estimates, partially because the \"occasional\" customer visited less.\n\nStarbucks drinkers are \"managing their checks, managing their frequency, or doing a combination of both,\" said Tower. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 30: People exit a Starbucks store in Manhattan on January 30, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nBut consumer staples companies that supplies both groceries stores and restaurants and bars could be well positioned in 2024.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) CEO Ramon Luis Laguarta said on an investor call that the company is \"putting a lot of focus\" in the food away from home channel, as people continue to go back to normal socializing patterns. The company is expecting to gain market share within the restaurants industry, per Laguarta.\n\nHow much people continue to go out will be the issue to watch for food companies that have large \"away from home\" businesses, Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBut moderating inflation likely won't result in lower prices in grocery aisles, said Spillane. Rather, consumer staples companies will hold the higher prices and reinvest the profit behind their brands.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (MCD) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has gained 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMcDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $12.37 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.47 indicates a change of +8.8% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.19 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5%. The $26.98 billion and $28.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.8% and +6.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.41 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.04%. The EPS surprise was +4.98%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMcDonald's is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD) released its fourth-quarter 2023 earnings report on Feb. 5, causing a sell-off. And yet, at the time of writing, the stock was up 5.50% on a three-month basis even after a 3.73% drop.\n\nWhen we zoom out even further, the stock is up more than 200% over a 10-year period. The earnings drop could be justified as a mere technical retracement and profit trimming. Indeed, there is nothing in the earnings report that could directly or indirectly point to corporate mistakes or strategy errors. My investment thesis is the share price is now at an interesting entry point for prospective investors who missed the end of year stock rally given the unjustified stock drop, the attractive forward valuation, the new CosMc concept and the exciting implementation of artificial intelligence in the business.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MCD. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nPullback Due To Earnings: An Opportunity To Jump On The Trade At The Last Hour\n\nLet us dive into the reported earnings. The earnings per share (EPS, which is the company's profit or net income per outstanding share) beat the Street's expectations by $0.13 to reach $2.95. This is an impressive 18% year-over-year (YoY) increase, especially for a corporation this large. The reason for the stock drop was the revenue disappointment: revenue missed expectations by $40m. That is a 0.6% miss considering the $6.41B revenue (up an impressive 8.1% YoY as well). Wall Street can be picky and the markets don't forgive even a slight miss. As mentioned, the miss is minimal from a quantitative perspective and couldn't possibly justify the erasal of $6bn of market cap; the nature of the miss may actually be of greater concern. Indeed, McDonald's is an international business with presence all-over the globe. Its ability to adapt its menus to local cultures has truly been the key to the business expansion on all continents, and support the continued growth of the company. Therefore, events outside of the U.S. could potentially have material impacts on the financials. When I looked into the quarterly same-store sales figures in the various regions, the U.S. saw an increase of 4.3% versus 4.45% expected while for the international figure the expectation was higher (4.79%) and missed severely by attaining only 3.4%. The international sales miss is what caused the stock to drop, and the main point of concern is the reason for international sales to drop: the situation in the Middle East, in particular the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's Israeli franchisee caused large controversy on social media after announcing its plans on Instagram to provide thousands of free meals to Israeli soldiers amidst the conflict with Hamas. The announcement was surprising because McDonald's has shown neutrality in conflicts over the years, key to being able to implement itself all around the globe with over 41,000 locations in more than 100 countries. The decision caused large boycotts in Muslim countries with large populations and growing markets, namely Malaysia and Indonesia. The boycott waves reached one of the largest and most profitable market as well, France.\n\nThe markets sold off the stock for a reason that is, in my opinion, a short-term circumstance and a short-lived event. Even if the boycotts were to continue, there is limited downside as it is unlikely they would intensify going forward (the peak of the boycotts were the days following the controversy). More importantly, McDonald's revenue depends less on its food sales than its real estate business and therefore, further downside from boycotts are mitigated. Harry J. Sonneborn, an early insider in McDonald's, once said, We (McDonald's) are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue, from which our tenants can pay us our rent.\n\nMcDonald's is a real estate business first and foremost. Out of the 41,000 plus locations I mentioned earlier, only slightly over 2,000 are operated by the company itself (the remaining ones are operated by franchisees). The company provides the franchisees with the product that the latter will sell to pay the rent to the company. Rental income in 2021 exceeded one third of the total revenue and represented the main source of revenue of the fast-food chain. This is the real moat of the business in relation to its competitors. The premium valuation reflects the quality of the business.\n\nA great business with an attractive outlook reflected by a rich valuation\n\nCompared with the wider fast-food industry, where competitors like Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) operate, McDonald's is rather richly valued. Based on trailing multiples, the stock keeps getting valued more and more richly over time. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nSource: TIKR.com\n\nTen years ago, the stock was valued at a total enterprise value of less than 4 times last 12 months revenue and around 10 times Ebitda. We are now at around double, meaning the stock has become twice more expensive than a decado ago. The reason for the growing valuation lies in its moat we discussed earlier. The company has successfully managed to mitigate the cyclical nature of its food business by the fixed part of revenue coming from the rental income of its franchisees. The company's growth prospects have also improved over the years, leading to a premium valuation on the multiples of revenue, Ebitda, earnings and free cash flow, which are all above the sector median. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nSource: TIKR.com\n\nThe rich valuation is, in my opinion, also justified by exciting innovations. McDonald's has launched a new concept that has been implemented in a few locations in the U.S. and is named after a little-known mascot of the company from the 1980s: CosMc. This new chain, CosMc, is focused on beverages and snacks and clearly aims to become an undeclared competitor to Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and Starbucks. The latter has been repeatedly criticized amidst a high inflationary environment to hike prices in an unbearable manner. CosMc has proven to be a huge success in its first open locations: the store has seen the triple amount of visitors per square foot than an average McDonald's restaurant.\n\nLast but not least, another exciting innovation is underway with regard to artificial intelligence. McDonald's announced in December a partnership with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google to gradually roll out an AI system throughout 2024 in the U.S. For now, the project is rather secretive with little publicly available information on the project. McDonald's has so far only declared that the aim is to provide to its customers hotter, fresher food and help managers quickly spot and enact solutions to reduce business disruptions. We can assume the AI system will help with orders, perhaps faster processing of orders and also in some ways cover for missing staff. It is not impossible that the implementation of AI could reduce the number of employed workers, leading to increased profitability. These innovations are still in the implementation phase and their positive impact could take months or even years to be reflected in the financials. What is certain is the revenue growth prospects and earnings per share growth estimates continue to improve, as shown below. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nCosMc and AI are likely to boost revenue growth with a significant outperformance relative to the trendline. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nThe earnings per share is also expected to outperform the 10-year trendline.\n\nThese events could invalidate my bull case\n\nDespite these great prospects and the fundamentals, my bullish case could be invalidated if McDonald's turns too political. Indeed, the business has been able to expand its presence, making it an unmatched brand - except perhaps by Yum's KFC - because of its ability to adapt to local cultures and consistently brushing off any involvement in geopolitical discussions.\n\nAdditionally, the new CosMc pilot project and the Google AI partnership are too uncertain to model any increase in cash flow projections in 2024. If they turn out to not be profitable, one or both projects could be a source of increased expenses in 2024.\n\nBottom line\n\nMcDonald's is a great business that is valued at a premium to the restaurant industry. In my view, the earnings do not justify the drop the stock has suffered, and therefore presents an excellent opportunity to initiate a position or continue accumulating shares. Despite the cyclical nature of the business, the continuous growth of the number of franchisees and the rental income stemming from them provide a reliable base to the financial health of the company. Exciting pilot projects like CosMc and the Google AI partnership provide comfort that the stock will likely continue being valued richly and the business will continue growing in the years to come.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 70%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in McDonald's implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 41% ownership Insiders have sold recently\n\nIf you want to know who really controls McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about McDonald's.\n\nView our latest analysis for McDonald's  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that McDonald's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in McDonald's. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of McDonald's\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$235m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McDonald's. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with McDonald's .\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "The restaurant industry is known for its fierce competitiveness, but therein lies a golden opportunity for savvy investors. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which arguably has been an industry bellwether for the longest time, is known for its strategic growth in the coffeehouse sector. Its focus on enhancing same-store sales and expanding store networks globally has been crucial in driving long-term growth for its business. However, in following its example, several restaurant stocks, have found success and have positioned themselves as advantageously in their niche.\n\nIn recent years, the restaurants and mobile food services market has demonstrated steady growth, with projections indicating an increase from $2,973.9 billion in 2023 to $3,119.7 billion in 2024, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.9%. This growth is not just a testament to the sector\u2019s resilience but also to its potential for future expansion. Therefore, investing in these resilient restaurant stocks offers a promising avenue to bolster one\u2019s investment portfolio, ensuring it flourishes regardless of market fluctuations.\n\nDave & Buster\u2019s Entertainment (PLAY) The storefront of a Dave and Busters location at a mall is seen during daytime.\n\nSource: Rosemarie Mosteller / Shutterstock.com\n\nDave & Buster\u2019s (NASDAQ:PLAY), the acclaimed entertainment complex operator, saw its share price soar by 35% over the past year, eclipsing many pre-pandemic peers. This growth stems from resilient strategic financial management, notably the significant amendment of its credit agreement. Its savvy move effectively lowered the interest rate margin on its loans, saving over $5 million in annual cash interest. Such financial prudence boosts both its financial flexibility and shareholder value.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, PLAY\u2019s latest earnings report showed it beat earnings-per-share expectations despite slightly missing revenue forecasts. The company isn\u2019t settling, though. It projects an average annual revenue growth of 7.5% over the next three years. Subsequently, its 24.4% revenue growth far surpasses the sector\u2019s median of 4.61% by 430.65%, highlighting its strong market position.\n\nStory continues\n\nBolstered by these financial and operational achievements, Dave & Buster\u2019s has earned a \u2018strong buy\u2019 rating from Seeking Alpha analysts, reflecting confidence in its continued growth and operational efficiency.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) A Shake Shack (SHAK) restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nSource: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top restaurant stocks to consider is Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), the New York-based purveyor of iconic hamburgers, hot dogs, and shakes, which has seen its shares surge by 53.7% over the last five years and an impressive 40.4% in the past year alone. Embarking on 2024 with enthusiasm, SHAK has unveiled a mouthwatering limited-time menu that promises to tantalize every palate. This culinary innovation accompanies the introduction of three \u201cWinter Classics\u201d shakes, incorporating traditional winter tastes with the chain\u2019s beloved frozen custard.\n\nMoreover, SHAK is set to open its flagship Canadian store in Toronto, signaling a major leap in its global expansion efforts. Financially, Shake Shack continues to excel, posting a 21.2% year-over-year revenue increase to $276.21 million in its third quarter, with earnings-per-share topping expectations at 17 cents. Looking ahead, the company anticipates revenues of $280.2 million and earnings per share of one cent for the upcoming quarter, highlighting its robust financial health and the promising outlook for its delectable offerings.\n\nArcos Dorados (ARCO) Three young adult friends sit around a vintage restaurant booth eating hamburgers. image represents restaurant stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother one of the top restaurant stocks is Arcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO), the globe\u2019s premier McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) franchisee headquartered in Uruguay, which presides over more than 2,300 eateries across Latin America. After weathering a series of downturns and a particularly harsh blow from the pandemic, ARCO\u2019s stock has impressively rebounded, surging 48% over the past year.\n\nAmidst its recovery, Arcos Dorados has been proactive in the investor sphere, participating in prestigious events like the Bradesco BBI Retail Days and the BTG Pactual Brazil CEO Conference 2024. These engagements underscore its commitment to maintaining a dynamic presence among investors.\n\nFinancially, ARCO is on a solid upward path, with its latest quarterly revenue reaching $1.1 billion, a 22% increase year-over-year and surpassing expectations by $36.6 million. Earnings-per-share also exceeded forecasts at 28 cents. The company\u2019s aggressive expansion, aiming for 80 to 90 new locations in 2024, reflects its ambition and optimism for the future. Tipranks analysts assign ARCO a moderate buy rating with a 22.6% upside, highlighting its promising outlook.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) olive garden (dri) sign on front of building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDarden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), another one of the top restaurant stocks is the U.S.-based conglomerate behind beloved chains like Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House. It\u2019s also witnessing a robust recovery, with its stock climbing 13.47% over the past year. This rebound shows the company\u2019s strategic agility during the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw many of its outlets temporarily shuttered.\n\nMoreover, DRI has announced plans to inaugurate 50 to 55 new restaurants, including a new Longhorn Steakhouse. This expansion underscores Darden\u2019s commitment to broadening its reach and serving more customers, enhancing its footprint in the competitive restaurant market.\n\nFurthermore, DRI\u2019s latest financials show strong growth, with earnings-per-share of $1.76, beating forecasts by 4 cents and revenue climbing 9.68% year-over-year to $2.73 billion. The company predicts full-year sales at $11.5 billion and adjusted earnings-per-share of $8.75 to $8.90, topping the $8.77 consensus. TipRanks analysts assign a moderate buy rating, seeing a 5.8% upside, underlining Darden\u2019s bright prospects.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) has skillfully navigated through industry hurdles, marking a 19.75% increase in its shares over the past year. This increase, coupled with a promising partnership with Uber (NYSE:UBER) through Uber Eats, underscores Domino\u2019s commitment to driving delivery growth and enhancing customer convenience.\n\nMoreover, DPZ saw a 5.1% uptick in retail sales growth, with a 0.9% increase in the U.S. market. This steadfast growth trajectory is further highlighted by the addition of 27 new U.S. stores, achieving a net growth rate of 1.8%.\n\nFurthermore, DPZ is revamping its digital ordering with a website and app redesign aimed at simplifying and enhancing the user experience, set for a fourth-quarter 2024 launch. Partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it introduced an AI-driven personal pizza-ordering assistant, elevating customer service personalization. TipRanks analysts give DPZ a moderate buy rating, with a 3.10% upside potential, reflecting confidence in Domino\u2019s strategic direction.\n\nU.S. Foods Holding Corp. (USFD) two chefs cooking in a restaurant kitchen\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nU.S. Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE:USFD)\u00a0slices through the food service industry with aplomb, distributing culinary must-haves to its impressive clientele. With a snappy network of over 6,000 suppliers and around 70 distribution facilities, USFD ensures that everything from prime cuts to fresh produce reaches restaurants, hospitals, and more. Its logistical prowess has translated into a relatively impressive 2.1% year-over-year increase in net sales and a savory 17.14% uptick in adjusted EBITDA.\n\nMoreover, its profitability has been impressive, with its EBITDA mushrooming by a whopping 47.57% year-over-year, dwarfing the sector\u2019s 7.32% median. Furthermore, its revenue forecasts are just as appetizing, with an 8.20% growth rate nearly doubling the sector\u2019s average. These numbers are telling, which is why it\u2019s earned a moderate buy rating from Tiprank\u2019s analysts, with them expecting a 12% upside in its stock from current levels.\n\nChiptole Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is redefining the fast-food landscape with its commitment to healthier options and sustainable practices, illustrated by a notable 64.19% stock increase over the past year. The introduction of an all-electric restaurant design underscores Chipotle\u2019s dedication to energy efficiency and a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nFurthermore, Chipotle\u2019s strategic investments in Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity through the $50 million Cultivate Next venture fund highlight its push toward sustainable farming. Leveraging AI and robotics, Greenfield Robotics aims to revolutionize regenerative agriculture by minimizing herbicide usage and enhancing soil health.\n\nFinancially, CMG reported a robust revenue increase of 15.6% year-over-year to $2.52 billion and earnings-per-share of $10.36, surpassing expectations.

        "title": "Feast on Profits: 3 Fast Food Stocks Cooking Up Hot Gains",
        "content": "The fast-food scene seems to be an intriguing place to invest these days with reasonable valuations and fairly defensive growth prospects. With a growing number of firms looking to feast on the profits from the booming market, not all fast-food firms are destined to reward their shareholders with returns above the market averages.\n\nThe firms that can grab more market share are worthy of a higher price tag. When it comes to growth in the fast-food world in the modern age, it\u2019s more than just about digitization, delivery and drive-thru, three traits that were the keys to success during the early days of the COVID pandemic.\n\nLooking ahead, restaurant modernization, automation and menu innovation could be the three keys to grabbing more share of the quick-serve restaurant market. Let\u2019s check in with three fast food stocks that look good to go in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) nosedived following the release of some distasteful quarterly earnings that saw some consumers shy away from the burger giant in favor of some good, old-fashioned home cooking. Once thought of as relatively inflation-resilient, it now seems that McDonald\u2019s has jacked up prices a tad too far, such that consumers have put their wallets away. Additionally, the value menu does not quite offer the same value proposition it used to, not after the storm of inflation.\n\nAt this juncture, it seems like McDonald\u2019s may be inclined to return to its value roots by addressing some of its consumers\u2019 affordability concerns. A viral photo of a $18 Big Mac meal is not doing McDonald\u2019s any favors on social media, especially as a fast-food firm that used to pride itself on food that\u2019s both tasty and affordable.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear that McDonald\u2019s overestimated the strength of its \u201cpricing power\u201d muscle. And now, it needs to beckon consumers back with better deals, new menu offerings and freshly renovated stores. A bit of automation couldn\u2019t hurt either, as firms beyond tech look to grab what AI has to offer.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) had delivery down well before many of its peers in the affordable fast-food scene. Though peers, especially those outside the pizza market, have since caught up, I\u2019d argue that pizzas remain one of the better items to have delivered straight to your door. Pizza pies seem to be immune from the \u201csog\u201d effect, something that french fries from the local burger joint may succumb to on those lengthy rides over from the restaurant.\n\nAs Domino\u2019s looks to move on from an underwhelming past two years that saw shares actually fall by just over 3%, investors ought to be enticed by what the pizza chain has in store in 2024. The company is serious about clawing at the share of its competitors in the pizza world and has plans to get the job done. Specifically, the firm wants to open more corporate stores while expanding its footprint internationally.\n\nInternational growth could be where it\u2019s at as the company looks to repeat the success it enjoyed domestically. As to whether the effort will cook up hot gains this year remains to be seen. At 29.1 times trailing price-to-earnings, I do like the price of admission.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava (NYSE:CAVA) is a lightweight in the restaurant scene with a modest $6 billion market cap. The Mediterranean restaurant chain recently received a \u201ctop pick\u201d rating from Baird. The firm views Cava as having \u201cmany of the same attributes\u201d that helped make Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) one of the firm\u2019s best growth picks. I think Baird is right to hold Cava stock in such high regard.\n\nUndoubtedly, Cava does seem to take a few pages out of an early-stage Chipotle\u2019s playbook. On the whole, Mediterranean food is quite fresh and healthy (like Chipotle\u2019s Mexican offerings), allowing it to gain from the secular tailwind of health and wellness.\n\nAdditionally, Cava is a small fish in a massive market that\u2019s ripe for disruption from new up-and-comers. All considered, Cava is a new-age growth play for those looking to play a different angle on the quick-serve restaurant scene.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of McDonald\u2019s.

        "content": "The fourth-quarter earnings season has done an about-face after starting out a little rough with disappointing banking results. Better-than-expected reports in the last two weeks have been driving U.S. stocks to new highs. On Thursday the S&P 500 crossed the 5,000 mark for the first time ever in intraday trading.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with MODG.\n\nLast week's notable winners were once again concentrated in the tech and tech-adjacent spaces, with artificial intelligence-focused companies leading the group. Recently IPO'd Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) smashed quarterly expectations and issued bullish guidance for the current quarter.[1] Arm's chips are found in many smartphone and PC devices, and they count giants such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Apple among their customers. Arm has benefitted from the race towards artificial intelligence as companies require more robust processors to support development. The stock catapulted nearly 50% in the day after its report.\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is another AI-centric company that blew results out of the water last week. The company surpassed revenue expectations on the back of strong demand for its AI tools, typically from defense and intelligence branches of the U.S. government.[2] CEO Alex Karp said the demand for large language models \"continues to be unrelenting.\"[3]\n\nOther standouts last week were consumer focused, perhaps giving some clues around the health of the U.S. consumer just ahead of major retail reports. Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) pleased investors by reporting an uptick in premium subscribers.[4] Disney (NYSE:DIS) saw shares climb after reporting a stake in Epic Games as well as the planned launch of an ESPN streaming service in 2025 and an exclusive release of Taylor Swift's Era's Tour movie.[5] Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) showed certain pockets of apparel are still strong after their earnings beat came from a mix of price increases and strength from China.[6] Fellow apparel company, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA), noted weakness in sales, but it was proposed cost cutting and increased profit expectations that took shares higher on Thursday.[7] In contrast, other consumer-centered businesses such as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) suffered poor results due to the Middle Eastern conflict and falling sales due to boycotts in that region.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result of better-than-expected reports last week, the FactSet (NYSE:FDS) blended S&P 500 EPS consensus now stands at 2.9%, an uptick from 1.6% the week prior.[8]\n\nMore earnings on deck\n\nWe get results from a smattering of industries this week including enterprise tech (MNDY, HUBS, TWLO), travel & leisure (ABNB, TRIP, MAR), restaurants (WEN, SHAK) and more. 4th-Quarter Earning?s Season Coming Up Roses\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[9]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies that have pushed their Q4 2023 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. However, only one of those companies is listed on the S&P 500. Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT) is set to report Thursday, Feb. 15, a week earlier than usual, therefore giving it a positive DateBreaks Factor*.\n\nThere are also several consumer-focused companies reporting later-than-usual next week. Those names are Topgolf Callaway Brands (NYSE:MODG), Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP), Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) and Cinemark Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CNK).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between Jan. 29 and March 1, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Feb. 22 is predicted to be the most active day with 549 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 69% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 32% have reported (out of our universe of 10,000+ global names). Roughly 67% of the S&P 500 has reported. 4th-Quarter Earning?s Season Coming Up Roses\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\n1 Arm Holdings FYE 24 - Q3 Shareholder Letter, February 7, 2024, https://investors.arm.com2 Palantir Reports Its Fifth Consecutive Quarter of GAAP Profitability, February 5, 2024, https://investors.palantir.com3 Annual Letter from the Chief Executive Officer, Palantir, February 5, 2024, https://www.palantir.com4 Q4 2023 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, Spotify, February 6, 2024, https://s29.q4cdn.com5 The Walt Disney Company Reports First Quarter Earnings for Fiscal 2024, February 7, 2024, https://thewaltdisneycompany.com6 Ralph Lauren Reports Strong Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Holiday Results Ahead of Expectations, February 8, 2024, https://investor.ralphlauren.com7 Under Armour Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results, February 8, 2024, https://about.underarmour.com8 Earnings Insight, FactSet, John Butters, February 9, 2024, https://advantage.factset.com?9 Time Will Tell: Information in the Timing of Scheduled Earnings News, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Eric C.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 highest quality fried chicken chains in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Highest Quality Fried Chicken Chains In The US.\n\nFried Chicken Industry: An Analysis\n\nOne of the prime reasons for the popularity of fried chicken is the ease it provides through its take-out options. According to a report by Market Research Future, the global take-out fried chicken market was valued at $6.85 billion in 2023. The market is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% from 2023 to 2032 and reach a valuation of $10.5 billion by 2032.\n\nAutomation in the fried chicken preparation process is expected to boost output as it cuts the demand for employees as well. One of the most notable tech solutions in fried chicken prep was developed by a company named Robo Arete. Their flagship project is a frying robot capable of preparing various menu items. The introduction of the robot arm also led to the launch of their brand, \"Robert Chicken,\" in 2020. The robot has been adopted by multiple brands and is expanding globally. Robo Arete is also developing automation solutions for cooking beyond frying, including hamburger patties and noodles, as well as a robotic bartender for soju cocktails. The company is set to launch various food tech solutions in 2024.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region dominated the fried chicken market in 2022. The growing disposable income in the region especially in countries including Korea, China, and Japan contributed to the large revenue share. Fried chicken is also a household staple for Christmas celebrations in many countries in the region including Japan. In 2022, North America had the second-largest share in revenue of the global fried chicken market. The rising number of fried chicken food chains across the country combined with the convenience they offer has played a significant role in its popularity. The region is anticipated to grow steadily during the forecasted period as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nNoteworthy Fried Chicken Companies In The US\n\nSome of the prominent names in the fried chicken industry include Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), and McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD). You can also check out 25 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants in America.\n\nYum! Brands, Inc.

The acquisition will bring all of EG's KFC restaurants and approximately 7,800 team members under KFC's management. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2024.\n\nRestaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR) is one of the most prominent names in the fried chicken industry with brands including Burger King and Popeyes under its belt.

        "title": "3 Stocks Everyone Will Be Talking About This Week",
        "content": "Midway through the current earnings reporting period, companies have been delivering results exceeding market expectations. As we forge ahead, now is the right time to discuss which stocks to watch this week.\r\n\r\nA trend observed during this earnings season is the increase in stock buybacks, a strategy executives employ to goose stock prices. So far in 2024, the daily average value for announced buybacks has reached $6.9 billion, surpassing the prior 4-year average of $6.5 billion for the same period. Firms expected to announce buybacks will likely draw additional interest, making good candidate stocks to watch this week.\n\nWith American consumers showing a proclivity towards budget brands as inflation continues to bite, budget alternative stocks could outperform. The travel sector is one of the outliers within the cash-conscious environment, with travel and tourism names exceeding forecasts. This points to some promising stocks to watch this week.\n\nDeere & Co (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) is poised to report its Q4 earnings on February 15, making it one of the stocks to watch this week. Those seeking clues about the food production industry are eagerly anticipating the company\u2019s results. Additionally, the purchasing patterns for lawn care equipment could mirror the spending capacity of American consumers. For example, those with surplus cash may opt to buy new lawnmowers. However, tight household budgets could postpone upgrading of equipment for a later period. High interest rates have already impacted the company, leading farmers to delay the purchase of new equipment in hopes of more favorable loan options arising. As such, DE will be one of the interesting stocks to watch this week.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts forecasts indicate a 20% drop in EPS from the year before to $5.16 billion, with lower sales of $10.3 billion. Aside from expectations, crop prices have seen a downturn lately, and Deere\u2019s results are often seen as an indicator of the agricultural sector\u2019s health, which feeds into food price inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will likely focus on the company\u2019s outlook and prospects of policy easing for gauging the potential growth across industrial agriculture sales.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock investors must watch this week is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), the staple soft drink manufacturer. The reason is similar to that of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) attracting attention. As one of the most frequently purchased products globally, KO\u2019s sales fluctuations can provide key insights into evolving consumer sentiment and the general perception of the economy. That makes KO another one of the stocks to watch this week.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s multinational presence, investors analyze how KO performs in regional divisions to discern varying economic conditions between the U.S. and other major markets. The upcoming quarterly results will be scrutinized for any evolution in demand patterns.\n\nAnalysts forecast a 6.7% surge in Coca-Cola\u2019s profits, reaching $0.48 EPS, with a 5.1% revenue increase to $10.6 billion. However, a rise in sales or prices could drive a market reaction. If Coca-Cola appears to encounter challenges in passing on higher costs to consumers, it would suggest a drop in U.S. consumer sentiment. Overall, several reasons exist to consider adding KO to the list of stocks to watch this week.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), among tech companies releasing earnings this week, could draw extra scrutiny. As a hotel alternative, ABNB frequently indicates travel demand, disposable income and how the housing market does. Given the numerous factors, it\u2019s safe to say that Airbnb is one of the stocks to watch this week.\n\nForecasts suggest the company will report a significant rise in EPS of 43.8% to $0.69. A revenue increase of 13.7% to $2.16 billion is also expected. Investors might look to determine whether the growth stems from market expansion or rising rental prices. Yet, the company\u2019s outlook is where attention will likely be more intense to gauge the company\u2019s ability to maintain demand throughout the year. Social chatter has been lively around increasing fees from hosts, with many curious to see what steps Airbnb might take to regain a positive brand image.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company is expanding its sales footprint at a pace that makes it one of the fastest-expanding brands in the fast-food industry. Management plans to launch as many as 165 new locations in 2024, boosting the store base by 20%.\n\nThere are major trade-offs to investing in a company that's this early in its growth story, though. It's an especially risky proposition in the restaurant industry, which is known for weak profit margins and high rates of failure as consumers' tastes shift from one year to the next.\n\nMost investors are better off focusing on established and profitable businesses. Let's take a look at why you might like McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) and Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) more than the fast-expanding Dutch Bros business right now.\n\n1. McDonald's earns its profits\n\nIt's no exaggeration to say that Mickey D's has the fast-food marketing process all figured out. The company has been serving up its Big Mac sandwich for over 50 years and thrived through several recessions and many shifts in consumer tastes during that time.\n\nYou don't have to worry about a surprise sales decline seriously hurting this massive global business. In contrast with Dutch Bros and its projected $1.2 billion of revenue in 2024, most Wall Street pros see McDonald's generating $25 billion in the same period. A huge portion of that revenue comes from stable franchise fees, royalty fees, and rent income, too.\n\nProfits aren't a concern as they might be with Dutch Bros. In fact, McDonald's is pushing its profitability to new highs toward a blazing 50% of sales (compared to Dutch Bros' 5%). That figure sat at 30% of sales just a decade ago, so McDonald's is still finding ways to squeeze more efficiency out of its global platform.\n\n2. Starbucks for a double shot of growth\n\nChoosing Starbucks over Dutch Bros isn't going to force you into the growth compromises that you might expect when purchasing an established, mature business. The coffee titan is expanding more quickly at its existing locations right now, after all, having boosted same-store sales by 5% last quarter, compared to Dutch Bros' 4% rate. It has plenty of room to add to its huge store base, as well, despite having blanketed most metro markets with its cafes.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarbucks is pushing into more rural locations, for example, with help from its expanding drive-thru presence. Toss in a thriving international business, and you've got some excellent growth avenues for the coming years. The chain added 550 locations in the last quarter to push its total to just below 39,000.\n\nYou might be tempted to prefer Dutch Bros, given its far smaller sales base of below 900 locations spread across 16 states. Reaching even a fraction of Starbucks' U.S. presence in a decade would translate into massive growth.\n\nBut the market leader is clearly the less risky choice, both for its large and stable sales base and caffeinated growth potential. Coffee fans continue to find reasons to frequent its cafes at a faster rate and spend more during every visit. As a result, when you look back in a few years, you'll likely be happy to have put Starbucks (or McDonald's) stock in your portfolio over Dutch Bros shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "If you can identify the right passive income blue-chip stocks, you will be able to enjoy steady income each quarter, and some companies have been rewarding investors for decades.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice to enjoy passive income frequently while your original investment continues to grow? Building wealth is a long-term process and while it can be your destination, the journey should be well-planned.\n\nOne way to achieve your goal is through dividend investing. Getting paid regularly and reinvesting this amount can help build wealth over time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo matter what, they continue with their dividend payments. Look for companies that have a solid history, steady dividend growth, and a competitive valuation. If you are looking for solid, passive income blue-chip stocks to invest in, here are my top picks for you.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal healthcare giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the best businesses to invest in. The company is growing because of its massive umbrella of products across diverse industries. Its innovative medicine and Medtech segment is growing at a rapid pace and continues to drive revenue.\n\nThe company also makes acquisitions to expand its portfolio. With a dividend yield of 3.04%, JNJ is one of the most resilient stocks to own. In the\u00a0recent quarterly results, the revenue came in at $21.40 billion, and the EPS stood at $2.29.\n\nOut of this, the medical devices business saw a 13% jump and generated $7.67 billion while the pharmaceutical segment saw a 4% jump and contributed $13.73 billion.\n\nThis is one company that believes in rewarding shareholders and has paid dividends for over 50 years. Trading at $156, the stock is down 9% over the past six months and worth buying at a discount.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite a slowdown in growth, 3M\u2019s (NYSE:MMM) valuation and a dividend yield of 6.48% make it a solid buy. The guidance for 2024 hasn\u2019t been impressive, but I do not think we should write off the stock just yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has a powerful presence across multiple industries and offers products that will always stay in demand.\n\nTo handle the challenges, the company has made multi-billion dollar acquisitions and has also restructured the business to reduce the segments from five to now four. It later announced job cuts and took more restructuring decisions to reduce the costs.\n\nThe company is down on full-year guidance, and this has impacted the stock. It means you can buy the stock while it is trading near a 52-week low of $93. While the stock might not see an upside soon, it is worth holding on to for the steady dividend income and the high payouts.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a company that benefits from the transition towards renewable energy. It is a utilities and renewable energy business that has offered strong dividends to shareholders. Most of its revenue comes from the utility business, which is also the largest utility company in the U.S.\n\nWhile the renewable energy segment isn\u2019t growing as it should, I think the worst is over. The fourth quarter results showed a strong improvement in the utilities business. NextEra Energy beat estimates in the\u00a0fourth quarter results, and the bottom line was up by 2% because of the growth in utilities business.\n\nIts operating revenue stood at $6.87 billion, and the total revenue stood at $28.1 billion, up 34%. While the numbers are impressive, the stock is down 23% in the past year and is trading for $56. Buying it in a dip could help enjoy significant gains as the energy sector improves. The company has a dividend yield of 3.32%, and has enough cash to keep rewarding shareholders for years to come.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nBurger giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) enjoyed an excellent 2023, and it showed strength in high inflation periods.\n\nAs one of the biggest names in the industry and a global presence, McDonald\u2019s is one business that will not disappoint in the years to come.\n\nIt is on an expansion spree and is taking steps to ensure high customer satisfaction through loyalty programs. It aims to open\u00a010,000 stores globally by 2027. The company has a franchise business which helps make the most of the growing number of MCD outlets. It generates revenue from the franchises while keeping the operating costs down.\n\nMCD stock isn\u2019t cheap and is trading at $291, but it is worth an addition to your portfolio. This is one stock that will continue to thrive, no matter the market situation. It enjoys a dividend yield of 2.29% and has been paying dividends for the past 35 years. MCD is one stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (EPD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a dividend yield of 7.85%, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) can be an excellent addition to your portfolio.\n\nFor a stock trading at $26, a dividend yield over 7% is a strong buy. The company operates in the energy industry and owns several assets that continue to generate revenue for it.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners charges fees for the use of its infrastructure assets and this produces reliable cash flow year after year. This is how it continues to reward the shareholders. Even during peak periods, the company sees demand for its midstream assets.\n\nIt has increased the dividend payouts for 25 consecutive years and has a solid balance sheet which ensures steady rewards for shareholders.\n\nThe company has invested billions into capital projects that will support growth in the coming years, and the stock looks undervalued to me. If you are looking for steady dividend income from a safe stock, consider EDP.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A Procter & Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the largest consumer staple companies in the world, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)\u00a0is a dividend aristocrat that has raised dividends for the past 67 years. It enjoys a dividend yield of 2.37% and has an annual payout of $3.76.\n\nThis is one stable stock to add to your portfolio and it will generate steady income for you. In the recent quarterly results, the company saw a 3% YOY rise in sales and this was despite the price hikes.\n\nIt also suffered because of the high inflationary period and this led to a flat volume. The company is aiming for an organic sales growth of 4% to 5% in the year.\n\nI believe the business is solid, and it has a range of brands under its umbrella which continue to generate revenue. At the 52-week high, the stock is exchanging hands for $158 but is a long-term buy and hold.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) makes massive machines that are used in the construction and mining industry. While the business is steady, it can become cyclical.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results were impressive, and it beat expectations.\n\nIts revenue came in at $17.07 billion, and the EPS stood at $5.23. The company saw high sales and growing demand as inflation eased. It ended the year with a backlog of $27.5 billion, and management projected little revenue growth for the year.\n\nCAT stock is trading for $322 and it isn\u2019t cheap, but this is one stock that will boost your returns significantly. It is up 30% in the past year and 136% in the past five years. The company has a dividend yield of 1.61% and has 31 years of consistent dividend growth. A frontrunner in the industry, Caterpillar is one of the best in the business today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

McDonald\u2019s also ended 2023 by launching its coffee spinoff,\u00a0CosMc's, a small restaurant with a DNA of McDonald's\u00a0but that serves customizable drinks along with sweet and savory treats. McDonald\u2019s reported its sales still grew but they were also below Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nFirst Fiscal Quarter Results Were Below Wall Street Estimates\n\nFor the first fiscal quarter that ended on January 1st, revenue grew 8% YoY to $9.4 billion and came short of analyst estimates that expected a 10.2% rise to $9.6 billion.\u00a0Adjusted earnings per share rose 20% to $0.90, but also came short of the estimated $0.93. Disappointing US same-store sales rose 5% with foot traffic rising only 1%, and check size going up 4%, with all three figures coming below estimates.\n\nChina Results Were A\u00a0Far Cry From Estimates\n\nSame-store sales in China rose only 10%, below Wall Street\u2019s 16% estimate and although foot traffic rose 21% YoY due to eased COVID-19 restrictions, check sizes tanked 9% due to consumers being cautious with their spending. Starbucks aimed to grow to 9,000 stores at its second-largest market by the end of 2025 but its plans got derailed by rising competition from locals such as Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee with aggressive pricing strategies.\u00a0Yet, Starbucks remains confident in its positioning to lead China\u2019s premium coffee market.\n\nOverall, international sales rose 7% with increased foot traffic but a decline in average check size. Its loyalty customers also spent record amounts per member.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Lowered Fiscal Year Outlook\n\nStarbucks guided for\u00a02024 total revenue growth in the range\u00a0between\u00a07%\u00a0and\u00a010%\u00a0while it previously guided for the lower end of the\u00a010% to 12%\u00a0range.\u00a0Starbucks is forecasting its global and US same-store sales\u00a0will rise\u00a04% to 6%,\u00a0while it previously guided for the\u00a05% to 7%\u00a0range. It guided for\u00a0China's same-store sales growth\u00a0in\u00a0low single digits, also lowering the prior 6% guidance to\u00a04%. But earnings growth is expected to remain flat, ranging from\u00a015% to 20%.\n\nStill, Starbucks remains ahead of its industry peers.\n\nTo increase foot traffic at its U.S. stores, Starbucks will be introducing three new flavor lines to attract Gen Z consumers and afternoon visitors. During the current quarter, it will also bring out its special creations for Valentine's Day.\u00a0Despite challenges that include the slower than expected recovery in China and Middle East conflict, CFO Rachel Ruggeri\u00a0reiterated that Starbucks continues to pursue its international expansion strategy as it aims to increase its footprint from over 38,000 stores to 55,000 stores by the end of the decade.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Could Challenge Starbucks In The Near Future\n\nMcDonald's is also cooking up an ambitious growth plan as back in December, it announced a record expansion to 50,000 locations by 2027, along with growing its loyalty program from 150 million to 250 million members.McDonald\u2019s also announced a partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google last year. With Google Cloud and its AI solutions, McDonald\u2019s aims to have the most tech sophisticated and productive restaurant platform in the industry. With the multi-year partnership through which Google will equip the burger chain with the latest technology, McDonald\u2019s already showed it is thinking big. Though McDonald\u2019s, Google Cloud also gained a valuable opportunity to show what its tech can do and reinvent the future of fast food. Moreover, empowered by Google Cloud and AI, it isn\u2019t unlikely for McDonald\u2019s to go after another concept and perhaps go after Starbucks\u2019 throne as well. But the tragedy that is occurring in the Middle East has shaken the world to the core as many mistakenly thought that the human civilization has evolved, so no wonder that consumers had something else on their minds before sweet and savory cravings. With such a gloom and doom global backdrop, both McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks could face more \u2018depresso\u2019 financials ahead, but such global players will undoubtedly identify new ways to cultivate the relationship with their customers.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Investors are back to looking at value stocks as many see high-flying growth as a bubble poised to burst. Even index investors focused on benchmarks like the S&P 500 are increasingly wary of the risks associated with a handful of stocks carrying the rest.\n\nThat\u2019s why value stocks represent a dual benefit: they help diversify away tech and growth risk, and, as the name implies, many are on-sale value buys since they\u2019ve gone overlooked for so long.\n\nOf course, value traps abound when looking at value stocks. That\u2019s why running down the details and validating that a company has a long-term and viable future is key when researching value stocks. These seven meet the mark, though, and could be the top value stocks to invest in this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) reported its first quarterly sales miss in four years this week, but that doesn\u2019t mean the value stock is down for the count.\n\nIn fact, McDonald\u2019s stock is rising rapidly after a quick downturn post-earnings.\n\nThe most bullish outlook on McDonald\u2019s centers on the company\u2019s rapid adaptation to emerging tech and trends. From an operational standpoint, McDonald\u2019s digital and delivery services are rapidly gaining ground on dine-in or drive-through, marking 40% of recent sales.\n\nThis shows that McDonald\u2019s is willing and able to adapt to shifting consumer purchasing trends as online ordering and delivery accelerate post-pandemic.\n\nThe company also knows how to listen to customers, as recent marketing efforts saw the Hamburgular return, Grimace milkshakes take social media by storm, and adult Happy Meals drop. All these initiatives mean that, far from resting on its laurels, McDonald\u2019s is happy to innovate and try new things in an attempt to drive sales, retain customers, and target a new era of fast food enjoyers.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s (NYSE:CAT) recent earnings report marked massive increases in revenue and profit alike, sending shares to record highs this week. But the run isn\u2019t over for this value stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the earnings call, CEO Jim Umpleby summed up the year\u2019s wins in a single sentence: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of our global team\u2019s strong performance as they achieved the best year in our 98-year history, including record full-year sales and revenues, record adjusted profit per share and record [industrial] free cash flow.\u201d\n\nCAT\u2019s annual revenue climbed 13% compared to 2022, with earnings per share peaking nearly 50% higher than the preceding year. CAT recognized that their higher financing rates led to increased top-line numbers, showing the company\u2019s ability to adapt to the new rate regime.\n\nStill, despite financial engineering, CAT also saw direct-to-user sales spike even as dealer sales stagnated. This points to an emerging trend wherein users want to cut out the middleman, driven by advances in tech that turn your home office into a virtual showroom.\n\nAs residential and commercial construction rates climb, expect big things from this value stock.\n\nToyota Motor Corp (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nMostly overlooked as electric vehicles and labor disputes captured media attention, value stock Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) is on a winning streak competitors wish they could match.\n\nThe company continues dominating the sweet spot between gas- and battery-powered vehicles with its popular hybrid lines, which Toyota attributed its recent success to in its earnings report.\n\nAnalysts agree, as Goldman Sachs wrote, \u201cWe think the market is now rethinking the potential of hybrid products, which are a strength of Toyota.\u201d\n\nBut Toyota is still hedging a bet on an EV-centric future, making it a value stock for the long haul. Toyota is dropping a whopping $1.3 billion on expanding its Kentucky plant to include capacity for a new all-electric SUV. Though demand is falling across the EV sector, innovation is bringing the tech\u2019s price down, which bodes well for the family and soccer mom segment the SUV will likely target.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT), a blue-chip healthcare stock and premier medical device manufacturer, is a top pick for value investors who want to capture healthcare\u2019s long-term upside.\n\nAlthough the stock stayed flat in 2023, it\u2019s surging today and returned over 6% since January. But the company\u2019s future outlook overshadows its current modest showing, offering an enticing opportunity for investors to enter.\n\nMedtronic\u2019s latest earnings report showcases a robust growth trajectory post-pandemic, setting it apart from many other healthcare stocks with a staggering 112% year-over-year increase in GAAP earnings.\n\nMedtronic\u2019s growth largely benefits from its venture into integrating artificial intelligence in healthcare. The collaboration with Nvidia (initiated in early 2023) aims to create AI-driven platform solutions, which they expect to be widely adopted by 2024.\n\nThis advancement holds promise for investors who have stood by during the stock\u2019s recent static phase, but it isn\u2019t too late to jump into this hot value stock.\n\nH&R Block (HRB) Image of a yellow building featuring the H&R Block (HRB) logo\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs tax season looms, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) stands out among value stocks based on its fintech innovation, a rare trait among mature firms typically shying away from new and emergent tech.\n\nLast year, the company navigated challenges amid speculations about the IRS launching a free national tax filing service.\n\nHRB has made an impressive recovery and now strategically positions itself to lead the tax return sector and seize new revenue opportunities.\n\nHRB launched a mobile banking service last year to counterbalance the tax industry\u2019s seasonal nature. By April, this service had garnered significant customer engagement, with 291,000 users signed up and total deposits exceeding $280 million.\n\nHRB\u2019s small-business accounting service achieved a 10% year-over-year growth. These strategic initiatives show HRB\u2019s commitment to stabilizing cash flow and securing a consistent revenue stream throughout the year, a notable challenge for tax-centric firms.\n\nHRB\u2019s total yield currently sits at 10.4%, shockingly high for any stock but particularly noteworthy compared to other value stocks. That high yield comes from a measly 34% payout ratio, too, indicating HRB has plenty of cash to grow while keeping shareholders happy.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T logo on wooden background\n\nSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) stands out as a top growth-oriented value stock, actively broadening its scope to target an interconnected world.\n\nSpecifically, the company is backing space startup AST SpaceMobile\u2019s (NASDAQ:ASTS) venture into satellite-based cell service, which is on track for a commercial launch in 2024. This initiative is just one of the driving forces behind AT&T\u2019s rise in 2024.\n\nThe company released its Q4 earnings report at the end of January, and despite earnings falling below expectations, the report highlighted strong growth areas.\n\nNotably, AT&T\u2019s wireless service revenue saw a near 4% year-over-year increase, signaling the company\u2019s adept management of economic pressures to maintain high subscriber numbers and implement necessary price adjustments.\n\nThis success is clear from the company\u2019s postpaid phone net additions, which outperformed expectations: AT&T reported 526,000 new plan subscriptions, surpassing the forecasted 487,500. This achievement is striking in a market that is already quite saturated.\n\nThough some (incorrectly) call it a yield trap, AT&T\u2019s current dividend distribution rate is 6.3%, representing a 56% payout ratio.\n\nU-Haul (UHAL) U-Haul van driving on a street in downtown San Francisco\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nU-Haul (NYSE:UHAL) is the name in DIY moving and truck rental, with competitors like Penske Truck Leasing and Budget Rental unable to match even a fraction of the company\u2019s 23,000 locations and 200,000 rental truck fleet.\n\nNotably, investors overlook the company as, in the words of Barron\u2019s writer Andrew Bary, \u201cThere is virtually no Wall Street coverage of U-Haul. It is run like a private company by the Shoen family, which owns about half the company.\u201d\n\nUHAL trades at a slim 16x earnings and 1.8x book value. If interest rate hopes hold true and the Fed brings its target down, expect substantial residential housing outcomes.\n\nThat means more people moving, which, of course, benefits U-Haul\u2019s bottom line as more elect to go the DIY route. Only 22% of movers elected to have a company do the work for them, while 37.5% went the rental truck route. Household budgets remain tight so, even if rates fall and residential moves accelerate, we can expect the DIY ethos to reign supreme.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Amid recent market volatility, certain growth stocks gained favor, but many deserving businesses remain overlooked. As 2024 becomes more welcoming for bullish investors, most investors also seek fresh opportunities in different stocks.\u00a0Smart stocks that can outperform in times of uncertainty may trade at a higher premium, and are increasingly in higher demand.\n\nIn recent years, the stock market has been facing much uncertainty. However, the S&P 500 surged roughly 20% over the past year. Long-term investors may expect a bumpy ride, but while uncertainties loom, consistent investment in robust businesses shows potential growth. Such investments allow one to capitalize on market highs and leverage downturns for additional investments.\n\nAlthough past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future success, resilient companies with solid use cases and a broad competitive advantage tend to thrive over time, contributing to a robust and diversified portfolio.\u00a0 Here are three of the best industry-graded stocks that deserve a spot in your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nAchieving 9% global same-store sales growth, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is truly the fast food behemoth investors should never miss out on. The company boasts profitability and a record-high diluted earnings per share of $11.56. While the company\u2019s 2024 outlook is less-than-positive with some analysts downgrading the company\u2019s profitability on its claims of becoming more affordable, growth can still be possible over time if volumes rise as a result. Thus, many investors anticipate McDonald\u2019s growth rate slowing to the low-single-digit level, and a flat operating profit margin in the coming year.\n\nThat said, McDonald\u2019s moat around its core brand and global presence remains unchallenged. I have another company in the same industry on this list, for the same reason. Fast food sales tend to remain robust in times of trouble. As consumers look to trade down in their dining preferences, McDonald\u2019s could conceivably see a larger share of wallet in the overall dining sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nRenowned for pricing power, McDonald\u2019s maintains a solid global market presence, and remains a buy in my books.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven with looming inflation and economic struggles, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is in a strategic and optimistic position. Boasting over $150 billion in cash, $341.1 billion in securities, the Warren Buffett-led giant stands out as a defensive conglomerate with growth potential. Buffett\u2019s long-term approach emphasizes capital preservation, making it a prudent choice in downturns. With ample liquidity, Berkshire is poised to seize opportunities in a major correction.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s endurance an strength are evident in its growth. The company is poised to succeed in the coming years as it showcased impressive revenue growth, from $162 to $302 billion over the past two years. With substantial investments in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Japanese firms, and others, the stock attracts value and momentum investors. As Berkshire pursues a long-term strategy, it is a value-conscious option amid tech uncertainties.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) a tray of food from popeyes\n\nSource: Tony Prato / Shutterstock.com\n\nPrioritized for growth, this other fast food chain stock Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) is also wasting no time in seizing new opportunities worldwide. With about 30,375 worldwide restaurants, major efforts are starting to pay massive dividends. The company has begun evaluating master franchisees and joint ventures. In Q3 2023, 250 new restaurants opened, fostering a 4.2% year-over-year increase in the overall count.\n\nRestaurant Brands emphasize service improvement through training, operations, reimagining, and appealing menus for enhanced guest satisfaction, driving comparable sales. Core platforms, menu balance, delivery expansion, promotions, breakfast focus, and product launches fueled traffic and revenue growth. Additionally, the company prioritized digital sales, with a 40% year-over-year increase in Q3 2023, driven by kiosks and delivery, reflecting vital digitalization and Tim Hortons\u2019 growth. Optimism surrounds international digital sales growth with diverse service modes.\n\nRestaurant Brands International CEO, Josh Kobza, recently announced the acquisition of Carrols Restaurant Group, aiming for long-term, high-return investments. While solving a crucial issue adds a $750 million debt for Restaurant Brands, this deal hasn\u2019t come without investor scrutiny. That said, if Restaurant Brands\u2019 management team executes smoothly, the remodeling strategy could pay off big-time over the long-term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Investors Shouldn't Overlook The Favourable Returns On Capital At McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for McDonald's, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$12b \u00f7 (US$56b - US$6.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThus, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for McDonald's  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering McDonald's here  for free.\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nIt's hard not to be impressed by McDonald's' returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 24% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 65% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 24%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If McDonald's can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.\n\nOur Take On McDonald's' ROCE\n\nIn short, we'd argue McDonald's has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's does have some risks though, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for McDonald's that you might be interested in.\n\nHigh returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Unilever takes sales hit in Indonesia over anti-Israel boycotts",
        "content": "By Richa Naidu\n\nLONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Britain's Unilever said on Thursday that fourth-quarter sales growth in Southeast Asia had been hurt by shoppers in Indonesia boycotting brands of multinational companies \"in response to the geopolitical situation in the Middle East.\"\n\nThe maker of Dove soap, Knorr stock cubes and Ben & Jerry's ice cream is among several Western brands that have seen protests and boycott campaigns against them - particularly in countries with large Muslim populations - over their perceived pro-Israeli stance in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nMcDonald's this week posted its first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years, partly due to the conflict in the Middle East. The company said the war had \"meaningfully impacted\" performance in some overseas markets.\n\nIn Indonesia, home to more than 200 million Muslims, Unilever's fourth-quarter sales declined by double-digits, the company said, adding that it has \"since seen some improvement to customer and consumer uptake in January\".\n\nUnilever CEO Hein Schumacher said the company was otherwise \"not seeing material impacts to our supply chain\" as a result of the Israel-Hamas conflict and related attacks on vessels in the Red Sea.\n\n\"There are some small interruptions obviously for some key ingredients and on shipping and so forth. So there's some delay but I wouldn't call it material,\" Schumacher said on a call with journalists.\n\n\"We are working with big forwarders and carriers and I'm aware of them taking longer routes,\" he added, saying that much of Unilever's products and materials are sourced locally and regionally to where they're sold.\n\nUnilever's Ben & Jerry\u2019s board last month called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The brand announced in July 2021 that it would stop sales in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parts of East Jerusalem, saying selling ice cream in the occupied Palestinian territories was \"inconsistent with our values\".\n\nIn 2022, Unilever sold its interest in Ben & Jerry's operations in Israel.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy for the Next Bull Run: February 2024",
        "content": "So far, to the best of my knowledge, only three prominent stocks have surged tremendously as a direct result of the AI Revolution: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2014 of course. Microsoft is incorporating AI into its software and sells AI tools to many firms through its cloud infrastructure unit, Azure. Super Micro markets hardware used to develop and provide AI, while Nvidia sells the chips used to create the technology. But many firms will need help implementing AI since they haven\u2019t done so before. As a result, they need to hire other companies to assist them with this endeavor, enabling these firms to ultimately generate a great deal of revenue and profits from these projects. Indeed, according to one report, \u201cthe\u00a0Global AI Consulting Services market is to witness a CAGR\u00a0of 38.5%\u201d between 2024 and 2030. I believe the stock market will begin rewarding these names soon, making them great AI stocks for the next bull run.\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nAccenture (NYSE:ACN)clearly sees a huge, long-term opportunity for itself in AI, as it intends to hire 40,000 more \u201cdata and AI experts\u201d \u201cin coming years.\u201d That would bring its total staff in those areas to 80,000.\n\nMoreover, ACN Chief Executive, Technology and CTO Paul Daugherty stated that many businesses are having trouble determining \u201chow and where\u201d to utilize AI. That assertion suggests the company, as well as its competitors, can indeed generate huge amounts of revenue and profits from helping businesses implement AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso noteworthy is that on Jan. 24, investment bank Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) identified Accenture as one name within the \u201csmall- and mid-cap\u201d stock group gaining momentum. The bank stated that ACN had \u201csurpassed multiple resistance levels,\u201d and shares were likely to climb going forward.\n\nAlso importantly, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) on Dec. 19 stated it would expand its collaboration with ACN to focus on AI. The announcement bodes well for ACN\u2019s ability to convince many of its large customers to similarly expand their partnerships with Accenture.\n\nStory continues\n\nEPAM Systems (EPAM) The logo for Epam Systems is seen on the side of an office building.\n\nSource: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.com\n\nEPAMSystems (NYSE:EPAM) provides \u201cdigital transformation services.\u201d In August 2023, the firm started a team to help businesses \u201cstreamline and enhance (their) AI-driven business solutions.\u201d\n\nAlso noteworthy is, in December, EPAM unveiled an open-source platform that will enable developers to create new AI applications. I believe the initiative is a low-cost way for EPAM to create new, innovative and highly useful AI apps that can market and sell to its customer base. Consequently, I think this initiative will prove to be very profitable for EPAM over the longer term.\n\nOn Nov. 3, investment bank Piper Sandler raised its rating on EPAM stock to Overweight from Neutral. The bank stated it became more bullish on the company\u2019s fundamentals and long-term outlook in the wake of its Q3 results. It raised its price target on the shares to $265 from $243.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) provided higher-than-expected 2024 top-line growth guidance of about 5%, excluding currency fluctuations. That was above analysts\u2019 average estimate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the tech giant expects to generate an impressive free cash flow of about $12 billion this year.\n\nIBM reported that the deployment of AI systems by many of its customers was meaningfully boosting the overall demand for both its software and services.\n\nNotably, CEO Arvind Krishna stated its AI-related pipeline had doubled in Q4 versus Q3.\n\nCalling IBM\u2019s 2024 free cash flow guidance of $12 billion \u201cthe standout metric,\u201d Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) noted it had only expected the firm to provide free cash flow guidance of $11 billion to $11.5 billion.\n\nIBM\u2019s forward price-earnings ratio of 18.3 is quite attractive.\n\nIBM\u2019s strong prospects and attractive valuation make it one of the great AI stocks for the next bull run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Dow Stocks to Buy on the Dip: February 2024",
        "content": "Stocks such as Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) have been among the worst performers. And while investors should steer clear of those stinkers, there are a few blue-chip names worth buying on the dip. Here are seven Dow stocks to buy on the dip: February 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the lead-up to its recent fourth-quarter earnings, Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell from a 52-week high. Its market cap dropped below $3 trillion. And it lost the title of the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unfortunately, Apple slipped even more after the Q4 results showed a 13% decline in iPhone sales across China. The good news is much of the hand-wringing is overdone, and there are still good reasons to buy Apple shares.\n\nWhile it is true that sales of Apple\u2019s electronic devices such as its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook computer have slowed, the services side of the company has more than made up for any shortfall. In addition, Apple still beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on the top and bottom lines with its Q4 print. Revenue rose in the quarter, breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of declines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple is one of the top Dow stocks to buy before it resumes its growth trajectory.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nAnother one of the top Dow stocks to buy on dips is McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). After the quick-service restaurant chain reported mixed financial results, the stock slipped. However, McDonald\u2019s fourth-quarter results were strong. For example, MCD reported fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.82. Sales increased 8% year over year, with total revenue coming in at $6.41 billion, which was a little less than the $6.45 billion forecast by analysts.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s blamed the revenue miss on the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has hurt its global sales. Outside the Middle East, all other global markets, including China, reported positive same-store sales growth. Domestic same-store sales at McDonald\u2019s rose 4.3%, in line with Wall Street forecasts. MCD stock is down 4% on the year and ripe for the picking.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up on this list of top Dow stocks to buy is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While the tech giant\u2019s results managed to beat expectations on Wall Street, they didn\u2019t blow away estimates. Plus, there was very little mention of artificial intelligence (AI) to be found in its report. This appears to have left investors feeling underwhelmed, which led to a pullback in the MSFT stock. However, investors should buy the dip.\n\nWhile Microsoft is only now starting to monetize AI, the company continues to demonstrate strong growth in its cloud-computing unit, with revenue from its Intelligent Cloud segment rising 20% from a year earlier to $25.88 billion. During Q4 2023, Microsoft closed its $68 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company has also announced custom cloud microchips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot AI add-on with its software bundles.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has seen its stock fall 10% over the last 12 months as earnings have been eroded by a decline in crude prices. After posting record profits in 2022 when crude oil was trading above $100 a barrel, Chevron has had to contend with a steady decline over the last year. However, there are still reasons to buy CVX stock. These include a dividend payment that the company just increased by 8%, taking the yield on the stock to 4.28%.\n\nChevron now pays out a strong quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share. Despite its profit in 2023 declining by 40%, the company still returned a record $23.60 billion to shareholders by paying out $11.30 billion in dividends and buying back $14.90 billion of its own stock. And although crude oil is currently trading around $73.50 per barrel, Chevron still managed to produce a record 3.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day last year as the company boosted its capital expenditures.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t been immune to the bank stock downturn, shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) have fared better than most of its peers. Over the past year, JPM stock has gained 23%, including a 2% increase so far in 2024. The world\u2019s biggest lender with $4 trillion of assets under management has proven to be more immune to high-interest rates than smaller banks.\n\nWhile JPMorgan reported mixed Q4 2023 financial results, the print was due to a $3 billion fee it was forced to pay related to the government\u2019s seizure of failed regional lenders. However, despite the fee it paid to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, JPMorgan is still viewed as having come out of last year\u2019s regional banking crisis as a winner. It acquired First Republic, a midsized lender to wealthy families, amid the collapse of several regional lenders across the U.S. First Republic is already having a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings, according to the bank.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSneaker giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) has been one of the worst-performing Dow components over the last few years. Over the last year, for example, the stock plummeted about 20%. Not helping, its share price plunged 12% in a single day in December after its sales guidance for 2024 was lowered. The good news is that Nike\u2019s stock looks to have bottomed right around $100 per share. Each time the share price dips below that level, it quickly regains its footing.\n\nPatient investors who take a position in NKE stock now are likely to be rewarded with future gains coming off the current bottom. And while Nike\u2019s most recent earnings print was mixed, it contained some encouraging data. For example, the company\u2019s gross margin rose for the first time in 18 months and reached 44.6%; inventories declined 14%; and sales in China, an important market for the company, rose 10.1%, which was the fastest pace of growth since May 2023.\n\nIt will likely take time to recover, but Nike is a Dow stock to buy on the dip.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Visa (NYSE:V) has been volatile, investors might want to buy one of the dips. After all, the company just reported Q4 2023 financial results that beat analysts\u2019 forecasts across the board. It also issued upbeat guidance as consumer spending remains resilient in the face of inflation and high-interest rates. It also posted EPS of $2.41, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.34.\n\nRevenue in Q4 2023 totaled $8.60 billion, up 9% from a year earlier and ahead of forecasts that called for $8.50 billion in sales.\n\nLooking ahead, Visa said that it expects revenue growth in the current first quarter of 2024 in the \u201cupper-mid to high-single digits\u201d and profit growth in the \u201chigh-teens.\u201d Visa said its payment volumes, which cover the year-end holiday shopping season, rose 8% in Q4 2023, while cross-border volumes increased 16%. The company\u2019s total transactions in Q4 rose nearly 10% to $57.50 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in AAPL and MSFT. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "(Adds analyst comments in paragraphs 6, 11)\n\nBy Deborah Mary Sophia\n\nFeb 7 (Reuters) - Yum Brands' quarterly sales missed Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, with weaker growth for all three of its top chains, as fewer customers ordered at Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut amid a choppy spending environment in the United States.\n\nThe company's shares fell about 2% in premarket trading.\n\nWith their budgets stretched, Americans \u2014 particularly low-income households that frequent fast-food chains like KFC and McDonald's \u2014 have been increasingly cutting costs, including by switching to home-cooked meals.\n\nFast-food traffic worsened in the quarter, with KFC and Pizza Hut seeing declines of 4.8% and 2.6%, respectively, according to Placer.ai data.\n\nTaco Bell, long viewed as the \"crown jewel\" of Yum's portfolio, also saw a 3.5% drop, the data showed. UBS analysts had noted the Mexican-themed chain's customers traded down to cheaper items in the quarter.\n\n\"For a lot of these fast-food players, what used to be $4, $5 or $6 meal has become a $10, $12, $13 meal over the past few years ... And people are starting to question that,\" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.\n\nSeveral Western brands, including McDonald's and Yum, are also seeing a hit to business in the Middle East and other markets like Malaysia and Indonesia due to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe Middle East, Turkey and North African markets together make up about 6% of KFC's system-wide sales, while Middle East and Africa account for 5% of those at Pizza Hut.\n\nYum, which franchises operations of its chains in the Middle East, did not disclose a financial impact from the war.\n\nGlobal same-store sales at Taco Bell rose 3%, while KFC saw a 2% rise. Pizza Hut posted a 2% decline. All three were below expectations.\n\nThe sales misses from KFC and Taco Bell were \"kind of surprising\", Yarbrough said, adding it appeared the two brands were losing market share.\n\nYum Brands' total same-store sales rose 1% in the fourth quarter, missing LSEG estimates for a 3.9% increase.

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) stock closed at $285.97 on Feb. 5. In the trailing 52 weeks, the stock price fluctuated between a high of $302.39 and a low of $245.73.\n\nOn Feb. 5, the global foodservice retailer released its earnings for the year ending Dec. 31, 2023. The financing activities section on McDonald's cash flow statement showed $4.53 billion in cash dividends paid for the 2023 fiscal year compared to $4.17 billion in fiscal 2022.\n\nBased on its current quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share, the annualized dividend payout for McDonald's is $6.68 per share. Using the stock price on Feb. 5, its dividend yield is 2.34%.\n\nHow Can You Earn $500 Per Month As A McDonald\u2019s Investor?\n\nIf you want to earn $500 per month \u2014 $6,000 annually \u2014 from McDonald's dividends, your estimated investment value is approximately $256,410, which is about 897 shares at $285.97 each. If you reduce your earnings target to $100 per month, your estimated investment value drops to $51,282 for about 179 shares.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nPassive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it\u2019s no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nCalculating your estimated investment value using dividend yields: To calculate your estimated value of investments, you would rely on two factors. The first is your desired annual income \u2014 $6,000 or $1,200 \u2014 and the second is the dividend yield of the stock, which is 2.34% in this case. So, $6,000 / 0.0234 = $256,410 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0234 = $51,282 for $100 per month.\n\nTo calculate the dividend yield of a stock, divide its annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock. A stock's dividend yield changes because of fluctuations in stock prices. Just like a change in the stock price affects the yield, any changes in the dividend policies can also impact its yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nAssuming the stock price remains fixed, the dividend yield will increase with an increase in the dividend payout and vice versa. The yield and the payouts are positively correlated.\n\nAssume a stock pays a $2 annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).\n\nDisclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share at the close on Feb. 5 using an annualized dividend. The price of McDonald\u2019s stock at the end of the trading session on Feb. 5 was $285.97.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.  Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nImage Credit: Shutterstock\n\nSend To MSN:\u00a0 Send to MSN\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 Per Month From McDonald's Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

(NYSE:UEC) is carving a distinguished niche in the energy sector, marked by a stellar 131.25% surge in share price over the past six months.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks Worth Holding for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Investing in\u00a0dividend stocks is generally reserved for those who prefer steady returns and low volatility over the thrill of rapid potential gains. Investors saw tech stocks explode in 2023 as artificial intelligence emerged. In 2024, investors expect further growth but are also hesitant.\n\nEconomists believe that a soft landing is the most likely scenario. Let\u2019s all hope that that\u2019s the case. However, it also makes sense to bolster your portfolio simultaneously with the safety of dividend stocks.\n\nAs with all others, February is a great month to invest in dividend stocks. Investors seeking income and stability should consider these buy-and-hold dividend stocks during the month and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDividend Stocks: AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie\u2019s (NYSE:ABBV) The story regarding its blockbuster drug Humira has been told many times. It\u2019s worth telling you again because it shows precisely why investors should consider the pharmaceutical stock, which offers an excellent dividend.\n\nHumira has been a massive success as one of the greatest-selling pharmaceuticals ever. However, It also lost patent exclusivity in 2023. Biosimilar competition is now allowed, and Humira\u2019s sales are rapidly declining. This outcome has long been expected and is not surprising to anyone who follows the company. The question is really about what AbbVie can do as Humira declines.\n\nThe answer is that the company is finding sales from elsewhere within the same immunology class of drugs. Rinvoq and Skyrizi\u00a0grew at rates above 50% in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s serving to soften the blow of Humira\u2019s decline. Humira is an outside contributor to the company\u2019s success, but sales only declined by 6% overall.\n\nThe company has a lot of growth potential in Rinvoq and Skyrizi and Recent acquisitions. Investors who get on board with the company\u2019s strategy will receive a dividend yielding 3.7%, which was last reduced in 1972.\n\nStory continues\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock will not attract many investors based on the strength of its dividend yield alone. That yield is a very modest 1.2% at the moment. However, what it lacks in raw income power, it makes up for in many other ways.\n\nPrimarily, Occidental Petroleum is a strong contrarian play for those who believe in the Warren Buffett school of investing. His Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0currently owns 34% of the equity in Occidental Petroleum. His firm has been buying the company over the last several quarters, and he is particularly big on the company because of its balance sheet and macroeconomic factors. Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway believe that instability in the Middle East will lead to a resurgence in oil prices.\n\nThe company has been buying OXY shares rapidly, particularly when they fall below the $60 threshold. The energy sector was the weakest performer in 2023 after 2022, which saw it as the strongest sector. The story of 2024 has yet to be told, but geopolitical instability will play a large role in the sector\u2019s performance this year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) feels like a very solid stock to invest in now. While the company arguably has a solid reputation, a lot of growth is coming. More accurately, McDonald\u2019s is already growing quite rapidly.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent Financial results tell a simple story. The company\u2019s Top Line is growing at roughly 10% within the United States and even faster internationally. McDonald\u2019s is not satisfied and continues to seek much greater growth.\n\nThe company aims to grow its restaurant count to 50,000 by 2027. If it is successful, that will be the fastest period of growth in its history. Meanwhile, McDonald\u2019s is also approaching growth in new areas\u2014namely, high-margin drinks sold by competitors like\u00a0Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nIts recent brand extension with\u00a0CosMc\u2019s is receiving an early strong reception. There\u2019s a lot to like about the company\u2019s growth strategy, even more so when considering its 2.3% dividend.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock is humming along primarily due to optimism around artificial intelligence. 2024 promises to be another strong year for the emerging AI sector. IBM believes that growth will continue to be strong, which could catalyze its shares higher.\n\nThe company released earnings a few weeks ago, which were particularly strong. Free cash flows were well above expectations, reaching\u00a0$11.2 billion. Further, margins reached their highest levels since 1999.\n\nInvestors will pay particular attention to continued growth from IBM\u2019s artificial intelligence offerings. Its book of business for generative artificial intelligence doubled between Q3 and Q4. The company is relying on some of that AI prowess to catalyze a reduction in the workforce. As a result, IBM is finding greater efficiencies and has a decreased need for human labor.\n\nIt\u2019s not so great if you\u2019re an IBM employee, but it\u2019s very welcome for investors as labor costs are commonly the greatest expense overall.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is among the better-known Healthcare stocks overall. The healthcare sector is noted for its reliability and lack of volatility. The reason is very simple: Consumers utilize healthcare at relatively steady rates that don\u2019t correlate with cyclical economic fluctuations.\n\nIn short, Medtronic is predictable. The company gives guidance, and it\u2019s not common for it to change it. Yet, Medtronic did exactly that when it reported second-quarter results in late November. Medtronic\u00a0increased its fiscal year 2024 revenue growth and EPS guidance, a strong sign overall.\n\nPart of the optimism derives from product approvals. Medtronic received FDA approval for several devices related to its cardiac business.\n\nOverall, Medtronic is an excellent example of what a dividend stock should be. The company\u00a0last reduced the dividend in 1978, implying extreme reliability. Moreover, Medtronic has grown its dividend by more than 8% over the last five years. Strong dividend growth is a particularly important sign for investors, and Medtronic has exactly that.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Albuquerque, New Mexico / USA - November 2 2020: Boxes of Band-Aids in Walmart in the pharmacy and over-the-counter medication aisle. Kenvue (KVUE) split from JNJ and now owns the Band-aid brand.\n\nSource: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com\n\nKenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is the relatively new spin-off of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) consumer healthcare division. The stock currently trades for around $21, below its IPO of $22.\n\nThat IPO occurred back in May of 2023, and Kenvue currently pays a dividend yielding 3.7%, making it a young, optimistic investment. Kenvue was spun off from Johnson & Johnson due to controversies surrounding its products\u2019 health. It\u2019s fair to argue that Johnson & Johnson sought to get rid of its consumer Healthcare brands because they simply didn\u2019t do as much for its bottom line as its medical device sector.\n\nThe company now has a chance to prove that its consumer Healthcare brands can stand alone as a stock and generate returns. The point here is that its shares are currently quite cheap and include a high-yield dividend approaching 4%. Analysts don\u2019t expect that those shares will decline much, if at all. Instead, they believe they\u00a0could rise by as much as 50%. Even if they don\u2019t, investors will have a nice healthy chunk of dividend income in the worst-case scenario.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock, like Kenvue, includes a dividend that yields more than 3%. And like Kenvue, NextEra Energy has seen better days.\n\nThe company is one of the more unique investments in energy. It is part utility firm and part renewable energy firm, both of which are the largest respective companies in the world in their sector. The utilities side of the business is called Florida Power and Light. It had a particularly\u00a0strong fourth quarter, with net income rising to $1.146 billion from $763 million a year earlier.\n\nHowever, its renewable resource business did not fare as well. Net income from NextEra Energy Resources fell from $995 million to $893 million during Q4.\n\nNextEra Energy benefits from the strength of its utility business, but ultimately, it remains at the mercy of greater narratives around green energy. 2024 should be a much better year for the solar and wind projects in which the company is particularly well invested.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional question. Today's conference all is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I turn it over to Chris. A cook in a busy kitchen assembling cheeseburgers for orders.\n\nChris Kempczinski: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. When we gathered at this time last year we shared the despite a challenging operating environment McDonald's continued to deliver historically high levels of growth. While macroeconomic pressures persisted throughout 2023, the resilience and power of our system was on full display, and we are heading into the new year in a position of strength. In 2023, we achieved global comp sales growth of 9%. Delivered comp guest count performance of nearly 3% globally with positive traffic across each of our segments, and maintained our leading market share across most of our major markets. These results are a credit to the tireless dedication of the entire McDonald's system. The over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, the industry's best franchisees and our world-class network of suppliers around the world, all executing with excellence and with an unwavering commitment to serving our customers and local communities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd in our restaurant focusing on the fundamentals of creating an exceptional customer experience has delivered operational improvements, improved service times and increased customer satisfaction across almost all of our major markets. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, fueling over 30% comparable sales growth since 2019 and our MCD growth pillars enable us to remain agile in response to changing customer needs. For example, we've expanded loyalty to 50 markets around the world and reached over 20 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales in 2023. Our user base continues to grow with over 150 million users that have been active in the last 90 days, making us one of the largest loyalty programs in the world. Over the last three years, we've also delivered tremendous growth in chicken by developing the McCrispy, a globally consistent high quality chicken sandwich.\n\nWith the goal of solving this unmet customer need across the system, it was developed and tested in a few markets first and has quickly scaled to $1 billion brand across more than 30 markets worldwide. Our chicken category now represents $25 billion in annual system-wide sales, on par with beef. And about a year ago, we formed a new business ventures team designed to operate as an entrepreneurial startup within McDonald's. The team quickly identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across our top six markets that comprised of beverage-led occasions where our core McDonald's business underindexes. In a little less than a year, the team opened a pilot CosMc's restaurant, and the buzz has been electric. Now let me say this again, we're only talking about a 10-store test.\n\nSee also 25 Best Colleges with High Acceptance Rates and 10 Best Cheap Car Insurance in New York for 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "content": "U.S. stock markets closed sharply lower on Monday regarding concerns about when the Fed will initiate interest rate cur and how much this year. Yields on government bonds rose following the Fed Chairman\u2019s tepid signal. Fourth-quarter 2023 earnings results were mixed. All three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.\n\nHow Did The Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 0.7% or 274.30 points to close at 38,380.12. Notably, 24 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and 6 ended in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 15,597.68, sliding 0.2% due to weak performance by corporate bigwigs.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.3% to finish at 4,942.81. Nine out of 11 broad sectors of the broad-market index ended in negative territory while two in positive zone. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB), the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) tumbled 1.4%, 1.4%, 2.1%, 2.5% and 2%, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 1.3% to 13.67. A total of 10.99 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.58 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 4.2-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.7-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.\n\nPowell Gives Tepid Rate Cut Signal\n\nOn Feb 4, in an interview with the CBS, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell once again reiterate that the central bank is in no hurry to initiate first cut in interest rate in March. He said the \"danger of moving too soon is the job's not quite done\" to combat inflation. Powell also hinted that the number of rate cuts may be less than expected this year.\n\nFollowing the news, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 13 basis points to reach at 4.166%. Last week, this yield was hovering around 3.81%. The CME FedWatch currently shows just 15% probability of a 25-basis point rate cut in March. This probability was nearly 90% at the beginning of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nMixed Earnings Results\n\nCaterpillar Inc. CAT reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.23 in the fourth quarter of 2023, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.75. The company reported fourth-quarter revenues of around $17.07 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.15 billion. The top line rose 3% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to favorable price realization.\n\nThe Estee Lauder Companies Inc. EL reported second-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55. Net sales of $4,280 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,190.9 million.\n\nMcDonald's Corp. MCD reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81. Quarterly net revenues of $6.4 billion missed the consensus mark of $6.5 billion.\n\nConsequently, the stock price of Caterpillar and The Estee Lauder advanced 2% and 12.1%, respectively, while shares of McDonald's tumbled 3.7%. All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nThe Institute of Supply Management reported that the Services PMI (purchasing managers\u2019 Index) for January came in at 53.4, beating the consensus estimate of 52. The metric for December was revised marginally downward to 50.5 from 50.6 reported earlier.

        "title": "McDonald\u2019s is promising \u2018attention to affordability\u2019 after the price of Big Mac meals hits $18",
        "content": "More isn\u2019t always more\u2014as McDonald\u2019s CEO recently admitted. After beefing up its prices in the hopes of generating more sales, the burger giant actually wound up turning off some core customers. Now, its chief executive Chris Kempczinski has hinted at a U-turn to lower prices, with a focus on \u201caffordability\u201d to boost sales.\n\nOn an earnings call Monday, Kempczinski revealed that sales in the last quarter fell short of expectations for the first time in nearly four years, thanks in part to higher menu prices.\n\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re going to see as you head into 2024 is probably more attention to what I would describe as affordability,\u201d Kempczinski told analysts.\n\nThe company posted global same-store sales growth of 3.4% for Q4, falling short of estimates of a 4.79% jump. In contrast, same-store sales increased by 8.8% in Q3\u2014before the increased menu prices\u2014beating analyst estimates at the time.\n\nLow income customers are snubbing fast food for home-cooking\n\nThanks to price hikes at the end of last year, the once ultra-affordable fast food chain is no longer a cheap eat option\u2014and it\u2019s not gone unnoticed by customers. The Chicago-based chain has taken heavy criticism over its Big Mac meals that are priced at nearly $18. Meanwhile, customers have slammed its on-off Dollar Menu for not having a single $1 item.\n\nIt\u2019s why, according to Kempczinski, customers making less than $45,000 per year in particular have stopped ordering from McDonald\u2019s. Instead, many have turned to home cooking as inflation has eased and the cost of groceries has come down.\n\n\u201cEating at home has become more affordable,\u201d Kempczinski added. \u201cThe battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kempczinski\u2019s definition of affordability may not meet customer's expectations. Prices at McDonald's are still expected to increase\u2014albeit at a slower pace of 2% to 3%, versus last year\u2019s 10%\u2014 restaurant analyst Mark Kalinowski told the New York Post.\n\nFortune has reached out to McDonald\u2019s for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s banked on benefitting from a 'difficult' economy\n\nMcDonald's leadership team may be surprised by the company\u2019s latest lackluster performance.\n\nKempczinski previously boasted the company is banking on customers feeling the pinch and choosing to eat at McDonald's as rising costs leave them with few affordable options.\n\nHe even described the current cost of living crisis as an \u201copportunity\u201d for the chain to shine.\n\n\u201cBetween inflation remaining high, the elevated cost of fuel, interest rates, housing affordability pressures and more, consumers all over the world are having to pay more and more for everyday goods and services, proving time and time again in difficult economic times, the McDonald\u2019s brand and our positioning on value is an opportunity for us,\u201d Kempczinski said on a third-quarter earnings call.\n\nMiddle East\n\nAnother challenge that McDonald\u2019s bottom line has had to face is war in the Middle East. The burger giant is among several Western brands that have seen protests and boycott campaigns against them over their perceived pro-Israeli stance.\n\nLast month, Kempczinski warned that the company has suffered a \"meaningful business impact\" following controversy surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, which has claimed more than 27,000 lives.\n\nThe announcement came not long after McDonald's Israel announced on social media that it gave out thousands of free meals to Israel Defense Forces personnel in October\u2014drawing criticism from McDonald's franchises in some Muslim countries.\n\nStarbucks has similarly slashed its annual sales forecast partly due to a hit to sales and traffic at stores in the Middle East, as well as, calls to boycott the coffee chain.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. \r\nAs a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. \r\nFollowing prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions) today's call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. \r\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nStory continues\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. When we gathered at this time last year, we shared that despite a challenging operating environment, McDonald's continued to deliver historically high levels of growth. While macroeconomic pressures persisted throughout 2023, the resilience and power of our system was on full display and we are heading into the new year in a position of strength. \r\nIn 2023, we achieved global comp sales growth of 9%, delivered guest count performance of nearly 3% globally with positive traffic across each of our segments and maintained our leading market share across most of our major markets. These results are a credit to the tireless dedication of the entire McDonald's system: the over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, the industry's best franchisees and our world-class network of suppliers around the world, all executing with excellence and with an unwavering commitment to serving our customers and local communities. \r\nAnd in our restaurants, focusing on the fundamentals of creating an exceptional customer experience has delivered operational improvements, improved service times and increased customer satisfaction across almost all of our major markets. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, fueling over 30% comparable sales growth since 2019, and our MCD growth pillars enable us to remain agile in response to changing customer needs. \r\nFor example, we've expanded loyalty to 50 markets around the world and reached over $20 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales in 2023. Our user base continues to grow with over 150 million users that have been active in the last 90 days, making us one of the largest loyalty programs in the world. \r\nOver the last 3 years, we've also delivered tremendous growth in chicken by developing the McCrispy, a globally consistent high-quality chicken sandwich. With the goal of solving this unmet customer need across the system, it was developed and tested in a few markets first and has quickly scaled to a $1 billion brand across more than 30 markets worldwide. Our chicken category now represents $25 billion in annual system-wide sales on par with beef. \r\nAnd about a year ago, we formed a new business ventures team designed to operate as an entrepreneurial start-up within McDonald's. The team quickly identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across our top 6 markets that comprise of beverage-led occasions where our core McDonald's business under indexes. \r\nIn a little less than a year, the team opened a pilot CosMc's restaurant and the buzz has been electric. Now let me say this again: we're only talking about a 10-store test. But more than that, we are excited about what this says about our potential to test, learn and innovate quickly. \r\nEach of these examples illustrate our ability to identify opportunities and adopt new ways to surprise and delight our customers. It gives us an incredible amount of resilience as a system no matter where the customer goes next or what the macroeconomic landscape may bring. \r\nIn the last year, we also implemented Accelerating the Organization, an effort to modernize the way we work so that we're faster, more innovative and more efficient. And over the past year, as I've had the opportunity to visit markets around the world, I've witnessed how the principles of AtO have empowered our teams to take the right risk, lead in innovation and reduce complexity in decision-making. \r\nSome of the senior leadership team and I recently visited Salt Lake City, and I witnessed firsthand how knowledge-sharing across the system is unlocking speed and driving customer lifetime value. The business unit is part of our Denver field office, which as a whole has embraced the power of digital, maximizing our platform to drive frequency and engagement with customers. This means that the restaurants can take full advantage of Ready On Arrival. \r\nIn addition to a national average 60-second reduction in wait times for customers that pick up curbside in our restaurant where higher customer satisfaction in these transactions, Ready On Arrival benefits the crew by giving the right information to the right person in the restaurant to deliver food faster and hotter. As a result, we've reduced complexity and stress in restaurants and Salt Lake franchisees are driving higher levels of guest count growth and franchisee cash flow. \r\nBy removing layers between our people and the restaurants and implementing a One McDonald's Way approach, collaborating across the organization is much more intuitive and teams bring the full breadth of McDonald's resources, skills and experiences to the forefront when making decisions. And as critical as this power of global scale is to our competitive advantage, at our core, we are a global business that is run by local small business owners that employ thousands within their communities. \r\nSince the beginning of our brand's history, McDonald's and our franchisees have been steadfast in the support of our communities in the most challenging times. And whether it was the recent earthquake in Japan, the tragedies that struck Morocco and Hawaii last year or the war in the Middle East, our focus is on creating a positive impact in the communities we serve. \r\nAcross the more than 75 markets in our IDL segment, McDonald's is a major employer of local citizens, creating valuable career opportunities for more than 780,000 local employees in both restaurant and office jobs and at more than 1,000 locally owned suppliers. \r\nWe're proud to grow that footprint. In 2023, the IDL segment opened an average of 4 new restaurants every single day, creating new jobs for nearly 50,000 people this year alone. \r\nAnd by removing barriers for children who need health care, Ronald McDonald House Charities helped to provide essential services for over 870,000 families across this segment. \r\nFor the over 130,000 workers in our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, our #1 priority is keeping our people safe. We recognize that families and their communities in the region continue to be tragically impacted by the war, and our thoughts are with them at this time. \r\nMcDonald's has always been a beacon in our communities around the world, led by local franchisees who work tirelessly to serve and support. The ongoing impact of the war on these franchisees' local businesses is disheartening and ill founded. As our value states, McDonald's will always proudly open our doors to everyone. \r\nThinking back on 2023, I can't help but feel tremendous pride in the entire McDonald's system. And as we think about our ambitions and the potential that lies ahead, there's never been a better time to be part of brand McDonald's. As I will continue to say, we believe there is still significant runway in our Accelerating the Arches strategy and we're setting our sights even higher. \r\nI'll speak more on the year ahead in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn it over to Ian to talk through our Q4 results.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned just a few minutes ago, core to Accelerating the Arches strategy is putting the customer at the center of every decision we make, acting with agility in any environment to deliver delicious feel-good moments at an affordable price each and every day. \r\nOur quarter 4 comp sales performance of over 4% in both the U.S. and IOM segments and over 3% globally remains a direct result of exceptional execution against this strategy, making it clear once again that our business is resilient despite ongoing macro pressures and challenges. \r\nAs a system, we've navigated countless challenging environment since we first opened our doors in 1955. This past quarter was no exception, and our thoughts remain with the families and communities impacted by the war in the Middle East. As Chris and I have both mentioned before, the war has meaningfully impacted our IDL segment performance, resulting in fourth quarter comp sales of less than 1%. Despite this, our business model provides stability in our P&L from the negative sales impact in the region. \r\nAmong the many strategic advantages of McDonald's are our size, scale and geographic diversity translating to incredible resilience as a system. We will continue to stay focused on supporting our people and the local communities in which we operate as we work closely with our DL partners in the region. \r\nWe are extremely proud of the way our system continues to consistently show up for customers in every corner of the world, highlighting time and time again the strength of the McDonald's brand when our system comes together. \r\nProviding our customers with affordable options has always been core to our brand, and it's even more important as consumers feel pressure on their spending, particularly the lower-income consumer. We continue to listen to our customers by evolving our value offerings, maintaining strong perceptions in value for money and affordability. \r\nCanada, for example, maintained their McMuffin and hot coffee pairing this quarter, providing an affordable bundle during a critical daypart and helping to drive market share gains in breakfast. \r\nThe U.K. followed a similar playbook by expanding their Saver Meals Deals to offer smaller bundles during the morning daypart for just a few pounds. Only available through our mobile app, this further cemented McDonald's U.K. as a destination for great food at great value while contributing to increased loyalty sales. \r\nThe U.K. also combined the strength of the McDonald's brand with its proven history of connecting with customers through successful holiday marketing to create Festive Wins, an elevated in-app experience that leaned into the holiday spirit with a fun and interactive calendar promotion. Through a combination of daily deals, compelling prices and exclusive merchandise, Festive Wins boosted digital engagement to an all-time high for the market and generated 4 million active monthly customers. \r\nAnd in Australia, the market brought back its 30 Days 30 Deals promotion, where customers enjoyed a daily deal available exclusive in the MyMc's app. From discounts on our most iconic menu items like the Big Mac, cheeseburger or our world-famous French fries to unique meal deals, the promotion drove remarkable engagement and contributed to a record number of active loyalty members in the market. \r\nBeyond maintaining an affordable price point, we're constantly elevating the McDonald's experience, enhancing the overall value proposition of the brand. This was evident as many markets offered Monopoly this quarter, leveraging learnings from across the globe to create highly interactive campaigns and once again igniting our fan's love for McDonald's. \r\nThe Canadian market tapped into global best practices by offering Monopoly with a Double Peel option for the first time this year by giving customers a second chance to win in the app. The market continued to amplify the digital experience while maintaining those core qualities of the game that our customers love. The customer excitement was on full display, and the market achieved record-setting results generating nearly 700,000 new app customers in just 5 weeks and driving significant lifts in mobile app sales. In fact, more than 43 million Monopoly codes were digitally redeemed during the promotion. That's more than the entire population of Canada. \r\nGermany also experienced record-breaking registrations with their Monopoly program by combining iconic peel off game pieces with the ability to scan to win prices in the mobile app. And for the first time, Germany offered loyalty points as prizes, rewarding our customers and driving additional digital customer frequency. \r\nAnd in France, Monopoly drove additional loyalty sales with an interactive redemption experience for our customers. We continue to navigate a difficult operating environment in the market, where results have softened and comp sales were negative for the quarter. \r\nMoving forward, we're confident that we have the right leadership team in place with the right experience to reset with our franchisees who I know are committed to restoring our strong foundation. We are acting with a sense of urgency to address our opportunities and maintaining a growth mindset in critical areas like value, core menu and delivery. \r\nOur One McDonald's Way approach to marketing extends beyond Monopoly as we continue to drive brand strength building cultural relevance and connecting with our customers and crew in new and exciting ways. This quarter, we once again tapped into the nostalgic McDonald's experience of enjoying a Happy Meal as a kid and recreated it for our adult fans featuring our core menu favorites at the center. \r\nOriginally launched in the U.S. in 2022, we brought back the campaign to the market in December, partnering with artists and creator, Kerwin Frost, and scaling it to 15 additional markets, including Canada. The excitement for the return of this event was evident, driving a significant social media engagement across many of our channels. And by encouraging our customers to trade up with a full margin promotion, we fueled top line growth with a strong average check lift. \r\nIn an environment where our customers are looking to familiar favorites, those core menu items have never been more relevant or beloved. At the center of our core menu are an iconic portfolio of brands, $17 billion brands in their own right, including 4 different chicken equities that are each $1 billion brands. We continue to stay aggressive on chicken this quarter, making further progress towards our ambition of developing a reputation for great chicken. \r\nGermany rehit the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich with strong results driving a lift in chicken sandwich sales and building additional customer affinity for the product. And the U.K. built on its market leadership in chicken by extending the McCrispy brand with a limited time offering, the McCrispy Smokehouse, combining new and exciting flavors and ingredients with our core chicken offerings. \r\nIn China, with slowing macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence near record lows, the market continued to build brand equity by combining our delicious food with culture and community through a collaboration with local street wear designer, Verdy. The campaign not only featured access to exclusive merchandise, but put our delicious chicken at the center and drove incremental traffic into our restaurants by offering customers a discount on a second order. \r\nTurning to our P&L. Our top line growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.95 for the quarter. This is an increase over the prior year of 11% in constant currencies excluding current year charges of almost $140 million for write-offs of impaired software no longer in use and charges related to our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy. \r\nForeign currency translation positively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.07 per share. \r\nFor the full year, adjusted operating margin was just over 47%, reflecting higher restaurant margin dollars across all segments. \r\nDespite the significant P&L pressures that we've discussed throughout the year, top line results generated $14 billion of restaurant margin for the year, an increase of about 10% in constant currency. \r\nLastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CapEx spend for the year was approximately $2.4 billion with more than half invested in new unit development across our U.S. and IOM segments. After reinvesting in the business, our free cash flow conversion was in the 90% range for the year. \r\nAnd with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nThanks, Ian. As we look to 2024 with elevated absolute prices and muted consumer confidence, we believe that consumers will continue to be more discriminating with their dollars. But we expect our focus on our MCDs will continue to drive growth across our business. And from a historical perspective, we know our resilience is rooted in our ability to adapt in any environment. \r\nMcDonald's is one of the world's most recognized and most beloved brands, providing delicious meals at an affordable price and showing up when and where customers need us. By building a One McDonald's Way approach to marketing and creative excellence, we will continue to scale the best ideas globally through common tools and processes that help us maximize return on investment and that shine a light on what people love about McDonald's. \r\nWe're creating an environment that embraces bold creative and we're remaining connected to culture by tapping into the moments, memories, rituals and behaviors that people have with our brand. \r\nAnd McDonald's position on value is a competitive advantage. With a strategy rooted in customer behaviors and insights, we are optimizing price while limiting customer resistance. \r\nAs we continue to attract millions of new loyalty members, we can get even smarter with our pricing methodology and tailor our digital offers to our fans, making them even more personalized. \r\nLooking ahead, we'll also continue to make our core menu even more enticing. With initiatives like Best Burger, we've made small changes that are adding up to big differences that our customers are really noticing. Best Burger is now deployed across more than 70 markets, including the U.S., and we're excited about the potential for growth as it deploys to nearly all markets by 2026. \r\nAnd as we look to build on our leadership in beef, we're addressing an unmet customer need across markets for larger, high-quality burgers. We're working horizontally across the system to innovate. As we test and learn, we'll be working to understand how the new offering will complement our already established burgers like the Double QPC or the Big Tasty. \r\nWe're also excited to further build on our success in chicken by continuing to invest in beloved icons like McNuggets and McChicken while further scaling emerging favorites like McCrispy and McSpicy. These 4 equities are the building blocks of our growing chicken business, and we see the potential to add another point of chicken share by 2026, in part through an expansion of our McCrispy platform into wraps and tenders. \r\nWe've made incredible progress across our 4Ds by taking the things our customers love about McDonald's from convenience to personal connections with our brand and making them even better. For example, Ready On Arrival will expand across our top 6 markets by the end of 2025. And while we build one of the largest loyalty programs in the world in just a few years, over 150 million active users today represents only a fraction of our total customers. We aim to reach 250 million active users and $45 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales by the end of 2027. \r\nAnd as you heard during our investor update, the world's largest restaurant company is planning to grow even faster over the next 4 years. We know our ambition to reach 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027 is a compelling opportunity, and we've done our homework. We've identified key areas with high population growth and lower store density across both our IOM and U.S. segments, and that's where we're starting. \r\nThese opportunities before us in the near term are compelling. But as we plan for long-term growth and solidify McDonald's leadership position, we've introduced 3 new platforms that will become part of Accelerating the Arches: to build on our competitive advantages, cement our place in culture and stay one step ahead of the next generation of digital customers. \r\nThis includes building one of the largest consumer platforms in the world to attract and retain highly valuable digital and loyalty customers. The easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform that puts intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams and drives a better experience for both our customers and our crew and a company platform that unlocks speed and innovation. \r\nWe believe our biggest opportunity to advance and acquire new customers and build more meaningful customer relationships that result in greater frequency and spending is continuing to aggressively invest in digital and technology as a 3-legged stool. For our customers, we will better leverage the data we have across our loyalty program to provide targeted offers and personalized experiences, building relationships with the customers that we serve every single day and ensuring that they enjoy a more familiar, consistent experience no matter where they go or how they were. \r\nFor restaurant, it's investing to put the most intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams that makes their jobs easier and empowers them to provide amazing hospitality while serving hot and accurate orders to customers even faster. \r\nAnd for the company, it is building the systems, processes and tools that will enable our people to be more efficient and innovate with speed and agility. \r\nAs I've said before, these are bold plans, but our success tomorrow has always depended on our ability to stay ahead of our customers' changing needs while reimagining what a restaurant can be. We're building the engine that will power McDonald's ability to unleash the full strength of our global scale where it counts. \r\nI'll now turn it back over to Ian to talk through our 2024 financial outlook.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nThanks, Chris. As we've discussed, we continue to operate in a challenging environment with varying levels of headwinds across our markets. Looking ahead to this year, we anticipate these headwinds will continue as the current macro dynamics continue to weigh on both our consumers and our business results along with the war in the Middle East. As we navigate these ongoing challenges, continuing to execute at the highest level with a laser focus towards growing market share will be critical. \r\nIt's clear that we've had exceptional success over the last 4 years with strong broad-based momentum and global comp sales of over 30% when compared to 2019. It's truly remarkable. But as we've mentioned before, we anticipate 2024 comp sales growth will continue to moderate as we return to a more normalized level of growth with expectations closer to historical averages of between 3% and 4% in our U.S. and IOM segments. And in IDL, we do not expect to see meaningful improvement until there is a resolution in the Middle East. \r\nWe expect our net restaurant expansion in 2024, along with restaurants we opened in 2023, will contribute nearly 2% to system-wide sales growth as we begin to accelerate our new unit development and make progress against our target of 50,000 restaurants by 2027. \r\nWith expectations of moderating sales growth and ongoing inflationary headwinds, we expect our company-operated margin percent will remain pressured in the near term and we expect the full year 2024 company-operated margin percent will be relatively in line with 2023. \r\nTurning to G&A. The financial strength of our system enables us to invest in areas that will drive long-term efficiencies for our people and for our stakeholders. We expect 2024 G&A as a percentage of system-wide sales to be about 2.2%, which reflects elevated investments in technology, digital and Global Business Services or GBS. Through these investments, we'll look to run the business more efficiently over time and ultimately free up more resource to continue to drive long-term growth. \r\nDespite headwinds throughout the P&L, we anticipate an operating margin of mid- to high 40% in 2024, driven primarily by top line growth and franchise margin performance. \r\nWe're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 9% and 11% compared to 2023 due to higher average debt balances and interest rates. \r\nAnd we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%. \r\nTransitioning to capital expenditures, we plan to spend between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion this year, more than half of which will be dedicated to new unit openings across our U.S. and IOM segments. Globally, we plan to open more than 2,100 restaurants this year with about 500 of these openings in our U.S. and IOM segments, where we continue to see strong returns. \r\nWe also expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IDL segment this year, including about 1,000 in China, where we recently completed the acquisition of Carlyle's 28% stake in McDonald's China. We're excited to have increased our minority ownership to 48% in our second largest and fastest-growing market and believe it will enable us to further benefit from the market's long-term potential. Overall, we anticipate about 4% unit growth driven by more than 1,600 net restaurant additions in 2024. \r\nAnd finally, we expect to generate strong cash flow in 2024 with free cash flow conversion in the 90% range. \r\nGoing forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, investing in the business to drive growth. This includes both capital expenditures as well as increased cash investments in technology, digital and GBS. \r\nSecond, returning all remaining free cash flow through dividends and share buybacks over time. \r\nWhile the macro environment remains challenging, we believe that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is the right playbook, and we continue to maximize our M, C and D growth pillars to drive strong results. We have confidence that our competitive strengths and our ability to continue to evolve to stay ahead of the customer positions us to succeed in any economic environment, delivering long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. \r\nNow let me turn it back over to Chris to close.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nFor nearly 70 years, the McDonald's story has been one of growth: a first job for millions, the best franchising opportunity in the world and a familiar beacon of support for the over 40,000 communities we serve. In fact, our U.S. business generated 1.4 million jobs and contributed $108 billion to the U.S. GDP in the last year alone. \r\nEven as the world around us continues to change, the power of our brand has stood the test of time. That's because McDonald's continues to reinvent itself and stay one step ahead of our customers. \r\nWhile our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, we will only keep growing when we're continuing to take smart risks and operating with a long-term mindset. Ray Kroc said it best, \"The only way we can advance is by going forward, individually and collectively, in the spirit of the pioneer in the pride of accomplishment.\" \r\nEven with all that we've accomplished since the launch of Accelerating the Arches, I am confident that there is so much more that we could achieve. I look forward to coming together with all 3 legs of our stool at our upcoming worldwide convention this April to share how we will reimagine our future together. \r\nThank you to our franchisees, suppliers and employees whose passion and dedication is central to bringing the McDonald's experience to life for our customers each and every day. With that, we'll take questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur first question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Sterling Palmer\n\nProbably just a two-parter. Quickly, do you think that there's any impact from boycotts to IOM results anywhere even if they're slight? \r\nAnd then separately, the multiyear trends this year have been stable for a lot of the year, basically since the second quarter. I'm really thinking the U.S., very strong multiyear trend. So there's no shame in these remaining stable. I'm just wondering if there -- if you think that there is a reason for those trends to reaccelerate or there's a lesson in that maybe your best play because, obviously, we're dealing through some very noisy months here with weather and whatnot over the fourth quarter and here in January. So I'm wondering how you're viewing that with the goal perhaps being that multiyear trend can reaccelerate into '24 and your best play to make that happen.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nHey, David, it's Chris. Thanks for the questions. First, on your question about the Middle East, obviously, the place that we're seeing the most pronounced impact is in the Middle East. We are seeing some impact in other Muslim countries like Malaysia, Indonesia. \r\nAnd then as far as IOM impact, it depends on the country. So in a country, for example, like France that has a larger Muslim population, we are seeing some impact in France. It depends very much on where the restaurant is located and if it's in a Muslim area, but we are seeing some impact there. And then in other countries like Spain, like in Italy, we're seeing no impact. So it really depends very much on the country. But as I said, the most pronounced impact that we're seeing is in the Middle East and in Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. \r\nAlso, as we said, in our prepared remarks, our outlook is, so long as this conflict, this war is going on, we're not making any plans. We're not expecting to see any significant improvement in this. It's a human tragedy what's going on. And I think that, that does weigh on brands like ours. \r\nBack to your other question about potentially a reacceleration, as we also said in the prepared remarks and we also talked about at Investor Day, we're expecting 2024 to be normalizing comp sales growth in that kind of 3% to 4% range, which is where we've been more historically. So we certainly had great performance over whether you look at it on a 2-year horizon, a 4-year horizon, 30-plus percent on a 4-year horizon, call it, 14% or so on a 2-year horizon. So feel great about that. But I think we are moving into a 2024 that's going to look more like what you would have considered a typical year prior to COVID and all the things that have gone on.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\n\nJohn William Ivankoe\n\nThe question is on France. And France has obviously been a leading market for McDonald's in a lot of ways for a couple of decades now, and in some cases, has actually been a leading indicator of positive performance in other markets of things that were done in France that were then copied by others quite successfully -- implemented by others quite successfully. So it did sound like you had some self-help in France: value, core menu and delivery. \r\nI mean did you find yourself, I guess, kind of catching up from behind in some of those metrics? I wanted to understand a little bit more maybe what you could have done differently in the fourth quarter to improve results. And do you think possibly there could be some leading indicators in France that are happening now within the market, of course, excluding the Middle East sentiment, that maybe we can apply to other markets to ensure those markets don't dip negative in the near term?\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. You're right in pointing out France for us has been historically one of our best markets. We have some of our highest customer satisfaction in that market. We have some of our highest franchising cash flows in that market. We're not happy with our performance in France right now. And if I were to isolate 2 areas that we are focused on to improve in France, the first is we did get offsides on value there. The team has done a very nice job in pivoting and just put in place a new value program there that we're seeing great early success with that. But certainly, that was a reaction and we don't want to see that. \r\nAnd then second, we continue to have operations opportunities in France and that's something that we've been having a lot of engagement on with our franchisees. \r\nSo as I think about IOM, certainly lessons there. But on the positive side, France is certainly our most pressured market right now in France -- or in IOM, but I also feel very good that we're going to get that business back on track and continue to have the performance that we've become accustomed to in that market over many, many years.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nAnd maybe, John, I'll just build on a bit on Chris' comments. I mean, I think 2 things. One is as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've got almost an entirely new leadership team in place in the market, a team that has a tremendous amount of McDonald's business experience and we have a lot of confidence in that team and the experience they bring, I think, to drive the right catalyst. \r\nI think when you have a market that maybe is a little bit off track, what you look to have you got the right people with the right experience to drive change and then do you feel like you have clarity of sight to the kind of underlying issues that you need to address. And I think on both of those fronts, we feel good. \r\nObviously, as Chris spoke about, it's going to kind of take a moment to get momentum going back in the right direction. But I know together with our franchisees in France, we're going to be aggressive to kind of go after the opportunities that we exist. And I think we're very, very aligned in how we're approaching that with them.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\n\nJeffrey Andrew Bernstein\n\nGreat. Chris, question as we think about 2024. First, I just wanted to clarify, I think you mentioned 3% to 4% comps in the U.S. and IOM. I'm not used to seeing such specific guidance, so that's encouraging. But I'm wondering if you could share any thoughts on the components of that between pricing, which we get the sense is easing versus traffic.\r\nAnd then just more broadly, the operating margin guidance from mid- to high 40% range, let's say, fairly wide, I guess, 500 basis points or so range. I'm just wondering if you can help narrow or perhaps talk about what would lead margins to be at the upper versus lower end of that wide range.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nIt's Ian. So let me take that. I think as we talked about on the comps in our opening remarks, I think -- and we've been talking about it, as you know, pretty consistently over the last couple of quarters, as inflation levels have come down and obviously our pricing broadly is coming down in line with kind of inflation getting back to what I'll call more normal levels, I think that's why we talk about comps kind of getting back to more of that historical norm range of 3% to 4% in both the U.S. and IOM this year. \r\nI mean I think the only texture I'd give you there is we had a slower start to the year. I think there are a couple of important reasons for that. Firstly, we had a really strong start to 2023. So obviously, we're lapping against that. And then I think you'll remember a year ago, we talked about just the abnormally mild weather that we were dealing with as a tailwind benefit in beginning of '23 in both North America and Europe, and so we're obviously working against that as well. \r\nI think if I was to think about the year, I think about the back half of the year probably being slightly stronger -- slightly stronger than probably the front half. Just again, we had an incredibly strong first 2 quarters of 2023 that we're working against. And I think some of the macro factors that were -- are going to impact us in 2024 could, I think, be slightly easing towards the back half of this year versus the front half. \r\nOn op margin, look, I mean if you go back to 2019, I think we've had a pretty strong demonstration of what we will continue to talk about, which is, over time, certainly believe we continue to be able to drive leverage and op margin as we get the strong top line growth. If you go back to 2019, we were kind of in that 44-ish percent range. We ended last year at just over 47%. I think that's a pretty strong proof point of our ability to continue to grow margins as we look forward on a percentage basis. I think obviously, as Chris talked about 2024, we've got some headwinds to work through, but feel really confident about our ability to continue to grow margins over time.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\n\nDavid E. Tarantino\n\nMy question is on the impacts you're seeing in the Middle East. I guess 2 questions. One, could you help to quantify your estimate on how much that impacted your sales in the fourth quarter? \r\nAnd then secondly, could you comment on the health of your franchisees in the areas that have been most impacted and whether you think some temporary assistance will be needed as you move through 2024?\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nHey, David, it's Chris. Just -- I'll do a couple of things and then let Ian clean up whatever I missed. But we're not going to get into specific numbers on the Middle East. But suffice to say, as you see in our IDL results, you can infer that the impact is meaningful, as I said also in our employee note at the beginning of this year. \r\nAnd then in terms of health of the franchisees, we're really fortunate in that we have some very strong, very well-capitalized franchisees in the Middle East. But as we have historically done, as we work through challenges around the world, you've seen us in partnership with franchisees do things to support them during difficult periods that sometimes can be deferrals, sometimes it can be other forms of support. And so those are ongoing conversations that we'll have with our franchisees. \r\nWe believe that working in partnership with our franchisees and doing things together through good times and bad is the way that we've been successful over time. So it's going to be very much a situation-by-situation approach that we have in the Middle East, but certainly, the impact right now is significant. And Ian, I'll pass it off to you for anything else you want to add.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nYes. Thanks, Chris. So maybe just a couple of builds to that. I mean, David, you know that, as I've talked about before, I think we've got an incredibly resilient business model. Obviously, if you look back over the last several years, we've had to work through a number of different external challenges, and I think the geographic breadth, the size and scale of our business and our financial strength means we're in a position of strength to kind of work through any of these challenges, including the one that we're currently facing in the Middle East with the war that's going on. \r\nIn regards to kind of support for franchisees or DL partners, as I've talked about before, I mean, providing support is part of our business model. It's obviously how we work together with our franchisees when conditions outside of their control warrant support. But when we do that, it's always, as you know, targeted and temporary and designed, obviously, to go to owner-operators or partners who are most in need. I think as Chris said, we've got some incredibly strong partners in the Middle East, the majority of those partners have been with us for 20 years or more. We've worked through a variety of challenges over the years. And I think we'll continue to be focused on supporting our team members in the region, working with the communities that we do business in and working closely with the DL partners to get through this together. And I'm very, very confident that we'll do that.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\n\nEric Andrew Gonzalez\n\nI'm wondering maybe if you could comment on China specifically. I know it's not a huge part of your profit today, but you do have some big growth aspirations in that country. So if you could comment on some of the macro challenges that you're seeing and how they're impacting results in that country? And maybe talk about how the brand is positioned to gain share in that market.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nSure. Well, overall, we had a very good 2023 in China. We were happy with how our business performed in China. We're seeing strong growth there. We also built 1,000 restaurants in China. So we're very much on track from our development aspirations and we would expect to do something similar in 2024 from that standpoint. So overall headline is feel good about what we're seeing in China and the progress in growth. \r\nCertainly, in China, as you've read about and seen it with a number of other companies, consumer sentiment in the country is a little bit more under pressure right now. And that is leading to -- in Q4, in particular, we saw the environment get more promotional. We didn't necessarily follow that, but certainly the environment is getting more promotional. \r\nAnd our focus is on making sure that we remain competitive. So we're going to do what we need to do to maintain our competitiveness in that market. But if you think about the overall macro trends in China, I talked about this at Investor Day, we certainly think that we're going to continue to see good comp performance in that market as consumer wealth and GDP continue to grow mid-single digits. We think there's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to build out development and penetration in that market to many places where we don't really have McDonald's presence. \r\nSo overall outlook on China for us continues to be very robust, which is why we increased our stake, as Ian mentioned.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nI might just add on a couple of things to Chris. I mean first, I would just acknowledge the team and our team in China, we opened just over 1,000 restaurants in 2023, which was an all-time high for us. And as Chris mentioned, as we talked about in our remarks, we completed the acquisition of the additional 28% to take our stake to 48% at the end of January. And I think we continue to remain really optimistic about the long-term opportunity there and our ability to have an increased stake in that long-term opportunity with that additional stake acquisition. And we're looking forward to getting that market to 10,000 restaurants by end of 2028, which is, I think, a really important milestone as we look forward.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian James Harbour\n\nYes. Maybe I'll just ask about the U.S. Are you willing to say kind of where pricing was in the fourth quarter and also into the first quarter? And also any color you can provide by daypart, I think we've heard some other companies talking more about late night or if you perhaps have any comments on breakfast recently?\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nSure. Well, I'll kind of just give some macro comments. Again, have Ian pick any details. But certainly, we've continued to work through pricing in the U.S. as we were looking to offset inflation. We saw what I would describe as mid- to high single-digit price increases last year. It depends a little bit on where you were in the country, but mid- to high single-digit pricing. \r\nWe are seeing, as I've talked about on prior calls, that particularly among the low-income consumer, there's some transaction size reduction that we're seeing. We're also seeing some trade down there. So that offset a little bit of the pricing -- the absolute pricing that we took. \r\nBut I think as you think about 2024, certainly, inflation is going to be less, probably in the low single-digit inflation in '24, and that will be consistent with where we end up on pricing. \r\nFrom a daypart standpoint, I'd say pretty balanced there. But breakfast continues to be a competitive area, a lot of activity going on in breakfast. Our business, as you know, is dominated around particularly lunch. That's our single biggest daypart and that daypart continues to do well. So nothing particularly noteworthy that I would say on dayparts, but Ian, maybe you have any other insights to share there.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nYes. You, I think, covered all the bases, Chris, but maybe just a couple of builds. I mean, I think we did see overall pricing for the year just around 10%. But as Chris noted, in the fourth quarter, that level of pricing came down, obviously, in line with inflation and was in that high single-digit range. I mean, I think we're continuing to see pretty consistent flow through with pricing, which I think is really important because it goes back to what I've spoken about before with just the tools and capabilities that we've put in place to make sure that when we are taking pricing, we're doing that in the most effective way possible. \r\nObviously, as we head into 2024, knowing inflation has come down a fair bit from its peak. I think, as I said earlier, I think our pricing we certainly expect will come down roughly in line with that as we work through the year. We certainly know consumers are more weary or weary of pricing, and we're going to continue to be consumer led in our pricing decisions as we kind of look forward to 2024 and knowing that the environment will continue to be competitive. We'll be thoughtful together with our franchisees, obviously, who make those decisions in their own restaurants as we look forward.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nGreat. Chris, wanted to just follow up on some of the color you just gave on the U.S. consumer and then some of that lower-income consumer, I think, managing the check a little bit. Just curious if you could elaborate anything more there on the consumer in the U.S. And is that check management largely been consistent with what you've seen in recent quarters? Or are you seeing any of the incidents or intensity there, pick up some? And ultimately, what does that mean as you kind of think about promotions and the evolving value options that you talk about in the U.S. this year.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nSure. I think consistent with what we talked about on the prior call, where you see the pressure with the U.S. consumer is that low-income consumer. So call it $45,000 and under. That consumer is pressured. From an industry standpoint, we actually saw that cohort decrease in the most recent quarter, particularly I think as eating at home has become more affordable. There's been much less pricing that's been taken more recently on packaged food. So you're seeing that eating at home is becoming more affordable that I think is putting some pressure from a IEO standpoint on that low-income consumer. \r\nIf you think about middle income, high income, we're not seeing any real change in behavior with those. We continue to gain share with those groups. But the battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer. \r\nAnd I think what you're going to see as you head into 2024 is probably more attention to what I would describe as affordability. So think about that as being absolute price point being probably more important for that consumer in a lower absolute price point to get them into the restaurants than maybe a value message, which is a 2 for $6 or something like that. Those probably are going to resonate a little bit less in '24, particularly we think in the front half with the consumer there may be something that's lower absolute price points. \r\nSo that's -- we are set up well to be able to go after that. We have our D123 platform, as you know, and I think you're going to see probably some activity there in the U.S. at the local level to make sure we continue to provide good value for that low-income consumer.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\n\nSara Harkavy Senatore\n\nI wanted to ask about G&A and it came in actually just below the 2.2% of system-wide sales you guided to, which is true despite the fact that I suspect that the system-wide sales were lower than you might have expected in the fourth quarter, given the implications in the Middle East. \r\nAnd so I was just curious to what extent are you able to flex your G&A? I know you usually guide to percentage of system-wide sales, but trying to understand whether sort of internally you actually forecast more along the time -- along lines of dollar spend? And are you seeing any of the -- any improvements perhaps because of Accelerating the Arches? I'm curious to what extent you have flex there.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nSara, it's Ian. Let me take that one. Well, look, I think you've heard me talk about this before. But the way we think about G&A is kind of in 2 broad buckets. I mean, firstly, we want to continue to work to run our business as efficiently as we can. We know we've got some opportunities in that area. It's why I talked about in our upfront remarks that we're going to continue to invest in the areas where we think we have strategic opportunities to drive greater efficiency. A lot of that work is going to be led by the Global Business Services organization that we stood up and is driving these transformation efforts in area like HR, finance, tech and getting after spend opportunities in areas like indirect sourcing. \r\nSo part of what we're focused on is continuing to make those strategic investments so that we can continue to drive greater efficiency in how we operate, which if you go back to the principles of kind of accelerating the organization, which was really what that whole initiative was designed around was how do we get faster, how do we get more innovative and how do we get more efficient in how we're running the business. \r\nThe second kind of broad area of G&A spend is obviously investing in the areas that we feel like we've got opportunity to drive growth and strong returns for the business. And part of running the business more efficiently is to make sure we have the resources available to invest behind the opportunities that we believe exist, and we continue to believe we've got significant opportunities. I think we've talked previously to the examples of kind of our tech platforms and digital capabilities where we continue to make significant investment. Those, I think, are really strong examples of the type of growth when you look at the growth mix that are coming from those investments and obviously continuing to drive strong returns for us, and we're going to continue obviously to invest behind those growth opportunity areas that we have. \r\nAnd so I think that's -- over time, as you kind of look forward, I do believe we'll continue to be able to gain leverage in G&A as a percentage of sales. But I think certainly in the short term, our focus is going to be in those areas that I highlighted.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOur next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\n\nChristopher Emilio Carril\n\nSo just on McOpCo margins, I believe you mentioned you expect them to be relatively in line this year versus 2023. So can you expand maybe on some of the puts and takes around this outlook? Maybe any detail on U.S. versus IOM, your cost inflation outlook? And maybe finally, if and where you see opportunity for company margin upside?\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nWell, let me take that. Yes, you're right. I think as you said, in our opening comments, we talked about the fact that we think our '24 company-operated margin percent will be roughly in line with where we ended for 2023. I mean I think there are a few things that are going on, so I'll kind of talk about it, U.S. and then International. \r\nI mean I think in the U.S., if you look at kind of commodity inflation for '24, we think that will be in the low single-digit range. I think wage inflation probably in the mid- to higher single-digit range. Part of that is because of the impact of what we're going to have to work through in California, which I know you'll be aware of and the significant wage increases that come into effect there at the beginning of April. \r\nI think internationally, on the commodity side, again, I think we expect commodity inflation to be in that low single-digit range. Wage inflation probably in the low to mid-single-digit range. \r\nSo obviously, we've still got kind of the current inflationary effects. And at the same time, we've got, obviously, carryover from much higher kind of inflation levels that we experienced as we work through 2023. So those are a bit of maybe kind of the -- kind of pressures. \r\nObviously, you've heard us talk about what we think from a sales perspective. So obviously, we're going to get a lift as we continue to grow sales through 2024 landing kind of where I said. But I think we remain really confident that we can continue to drive leverage in margins as we look forward as some of these inflationary pressures begin to settle on a more consistent basis. And we're able to continue to grow sales, which we're obviously really, really confident in our ability to do that with the plans and strategies that we've got in place.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nWe have time for one more question from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Danielle Silberman\n\nJust a follow-up. Given the modest pricing in '24 in the U.S., do you expect positive traffic then? \r\nAnd then my actual question is on the digital side. Can you talk about any changes as it relates to your approach, specifically to value offers as you look ahead into '24 in the U.S.? Have a lot of promotions on the app also driving higher ticket, frequency. So just -- to what extent is digital marketing accretive to franchisees? And just any thoughts there.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nSure. Well, as you know, we don't give traffic guidance. So we won't get into kind of a specific what do we expect to see in traffic. But I think it's fair to say that the success in this industry is always about having balance and you need to have both traffic growth and you need to have price growth. That's the long-term formula for success. So that's kind of what we use as our North Star. \r\nI think we're set up really well to have that kind of balance. As I look at our business around the world, our brand is in great shape. We are seeing some of our highest customer satisfaction scores around the world. We're seeing our operations in almost every single country around the world get better as we execute our Performance and Customer Excellence program or PACE, as you know it. I think globally, in Q4, we saw service times improve by 10 seconds. \r\nAnd we've got very good alignment with our franchisees. In most of our big markets, we're seeing healthy franchising cash flows. In the U.S., franchising cash flows were up roughly $35,000 last year despite all the price headwinds. \r\nSo I think we're set up well as a business to have that balance right as part of our long-term focus.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nOkay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

In addition, some low-income customers have stopped patronizing the chain as inflation has caused prices to jump, Kempczinski said.\n\nBURGER KING OWNER RESTAURANT BRANDS BUYS FRANCHISEE CARROLS FOR $1 BILLION Big Mac is seen on a restaurant table in this illustration photo taken.

        "content": "A franchisee of fast food giant McDonald's has agreed to pay a teenage girl $4.4 million to settle her lawsuit over having been sexually assaulted by a Pittsburgh-area restaurant manager who was a registered sex offender, the victim's lawyers announced on Monday.\n\nThe deal between the girl, who was 14 at the time of the 2021 sexual assault, and McDonald's franchisee Rice Enterprises LLC, compensates her for the attack by Walter A. Garner in the restaurant bathroom.\n\nAt the time, Garner, now 44, had served prison time and was listed on the Megan's Law website for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl.\n\nGarner pleaded guilty in 2021 to statutory sexual assault, indecent assault and other charges for the McDonald's assault and is serving a state prison sentence. A message seeking comment was left Monday for the public defenders who represented him in that case and in the 2003 case that was resolved with a guilty plea to aggravated indecent assault and other charges.\n\nThe lawsuit helped prompt an October 2021 strike by workers in 12 U.S. cities, an effort to get the company to better address what they described as an ongoing problem of sexual harassment and violence in McDonald's stores.\n\nThrough a McDonald's spokesperson, Rice Enterprises said it fired Garner as soon as they learned of the allegations against him in 2021.\n\n\u201cSince then, we\u2019ve redoubled our efforts to ensure a positive and respectful experience for all employees in our restaurants, and our organization maintains a zero-tolerance policy for harassment of any kind,\u201d Rice Enterprises said in the emailed statement. The company said it puts new hires through \u201csafe and respectful workplace training\" and has enhanced security.\n\nThe employee was 14 when she began working at a McDonald's in Bethel Park in October 2020. She said she had no training on sexual harassment or how to report it. Garner made sexual comments to her and touched her inappropriately before the bathroom sexual assault in mid-February 2021, according to the lawsuit.\n\nStory continues\n\nGarner was arrested in April 2021 after another McDonald\u2019s employee told administrators at her school about his behavior and police were called, the lawsuit said.\n\nLawyer Alan Perer, who represents the girl and her parents in the Allegheny County civil litigation, said he questions how a sex offender was hired to manage girls of high school age.\n\n\u201cFor a company to allow a known sex offender to have access to and control over young teens turns America\u2019s best first job into a nightmare for those teens,\u201d Perer said in a release.\n\nMcDonald's USA called the girl's assault deeply troubling, issuing a statement that said violence and sexual harassment are completely unacceptable. The company said it is committed to providing franchisees with training resources to help prevent harassment.",

        "content": "Did Meta and Amazon just save earnings season?\n\nBig tech earnings kicked off earnings season last week and not all of the results were so magnificent. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) got things started on Tuesday, and while both surpassed top and bottom-line expectations, it wasn't enough for investors. Weak advertising revenues for Alphabet resulted in a nearly 6% stock price decline in the wake of the report,[1] and light guidance from Microsoft also didn't go over well with investors.[2] Given the momentum tech had into these reports and rich price-earnings levels, investors were less willing to forgive minor stumbles. The same went for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which reported disappointing revenue from China on Thursday, the stock fell over 5% in the hours after the report before climbing back on Friday.[3]\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nThe two standouts for last week were undoubtedly Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (AMZN?), both handily beating expectations on the top and bottom-line.[4] Even sweeter for Meta investors was the announcement of the company's first ever dividend of 50 cents as well as a $50 billion buyback plan.[5] CEO Mark Zuckerberg also vowed to \"keep things lean,\" a strategy that has worked well for the social media company who successfully pulled off the \"year of efficiency\" in 2023.[6]\n\nAs a result of better-than-expected reports last week, the FactSet blended S&P 500 EPS consensus now stands at 1.6%, an uptick from -1.4% the week prior.[7]\n\nBut that's not all that moved the markets last week, the first Federal Reserve meeting of 2024 ended up being a bust when Chairman Powell indicated they are not ready to begin cutting rates yet.[8] The CME Group FedWatch tool is now predicting a 60% probability of a rate cut at the May 1st meeting, with the likelihood of a March 20th cut falling to 21%.[9]\n\nWhile markets initially fell after that news on Wednesday, they perked back up after Thursday's tech results and Friday's blockbuster jobs number. Nonfarm Payrolls came in at 353,000 for January, and unemployment stayed at 3.7%, marking 24 consecutive months of sub-4% unemployment and the longest stretch since the 1960s.[10]\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustrials, pharma and consumer discretionary take center stage?\n\nWe get results from a smattering of sectors this week, including the restaurant space (MCD, CMG), Industrials (CAT, UBER), pharma (GILD, LLY) and always highly anticipated Disney (NYSE:DIS). Not All of Big Tech Posted Magnificent Results for the 4th Quarter\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week?\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[11]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their fourth-quarter 2023 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Nine companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), IDEX Corporation (NYSE:IEX), Edwards Lifesciences Corp (NYSE:EW), Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA), McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) and Catalent Inc. (NYSE:CTLT).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nQ4 earnings wave?\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between Jan. 29 - March 1, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Feb. 22 is predicted to be the most active day with 561 companies anticipated to report. Thus far, 64% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 18% have reported (out of our universe of 10,000+ global names). Roughly 46% of the S&P 500 has reported.

Like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX), McDonalds is experiencing a meaningful business impact from the war between Israel and Hamas. Weighted down by weak sales growth across the Middle East, China and India, the burger chain reported its first sales miss in almost four years.\n\nMiddle East\u00a0Backlash\n\nBoth Starbucks and McDonalds issued a public statement in attempt to fight misconceptions and untangle their respective brands from controversies related to the war that led to boycotts affecting their stores not only in the Middle East but across the globe.\n\nWeak Consumer Spending In China\n\nDespite government support, consumer spending at McDonald\u2019s second largest market remained weak. Starbucks also reported its recovery in China is going slower than expected.\n\nA Mixed Fourth Quarter\n\nFor the December quarter, McDonalds reported revenue rose 8% to\u00a0$6.41 billion, falling short of $6.45 billion that LSEG expected. Same-store sales grew 3.4%, also falling short of StreetAccount\u2019s 4.7% estimate with international developmental licensed markets segment reporting a same-store sales increase of only 0.7%. Domestic store sales grew in line with expectations, more precisely at 4.3% due to price hikes, efficient marketing and increase in digital and delivery orders. However, McDonald\u2019s did not disclose if U.S. traffic continued to fall after the reported drop in the previous, third, quarter.\n\nNet income amounted to $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share\u00a0and adjusted earnings amounted to $2.95 per share after excluding restricting costs and other one-time items.\n\nAs for the annual 2023 revenue, sales grew 10% compared to 2022, as they amounted to\u00a0$25.49 billion.\n\n2024 Kicked Off With A Slower Start But McDonald\u2019s Still Plans To Accelerate Its Expansion\n\nThe fast-food giant topped analyst estimates on the earnings front,\u00a0\u00a0but posted a rare sales miss due to international market weaknesses. However, McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t thinking of slowing down as it plans to spend\u00a0between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion on capital expenditures, with half of those funds aimed at opening new stores across the U.S. and international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week, Starbucks lowered its annual outlook partly due to lowered sales and traffic at its Middle East stores and McDonald\u2019s is also expecting the negative impact on its sales from the ongoing war to continue until the conflict is resolved. Yet, despite pressures, McDonald\u2019s\u00a0reiterated\u00a0its December guidance with new restaurants increasing its sales growth by almost 2%, showing it remains confidence in the resilience of its business despite lingering macroeconomic challenges.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Britain's services sector has performed better than businesses in France and Germany - ANDY RAIN/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nBritain\u2019s dominant services sector expanded at its fastest pace in eight months as France and Germany\u2019s companies slumped, according to closely-watched surveys.\n\nThe S&P Global UK Services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) - a key monthly barometer of the sector\u2019s performance - rose to 54.3 in January, up from 53.4 in December.\n\nIt was above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the third consecutive month.\n\nTim Moore, economics director at S&P Global, said: \u201cThe revival in UK service sector performance gained momentum at the start of 2024, with output growth accelerating to its fastest for eight months amid stronger business and consumer spending.\u201d\n\nHowever, it was a different story in Europe. France\u2019s services businesses are in their longest downturn for more than a decade, with its PMI showing a decline for the eighth consecutive month.\n\nGermany\u2019s services sector PMI worsened to a five-month low.\n\nNorman Liebke, economist at Hamburg at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said \u201cthe best we can say for the first quarter is that we expect a stagnation of the French economy\u201d while his colleague Dr Cyrus de la Rubia said Germany\u2019s sector was \u201cfirmly entrenched in inflationary territory\u201d.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:17 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

The biggest riser was Ocado, up 3.56pc, while GSK followed not far behind, closing up 3.19pc. The biggest faller was JD Sports, down 5.27pc, followed by telecoms firm Airtel Africa, down 4.40pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 dropped 0.80pc. The biggest riser was Helios Towers, which runs telecoms infrastructure in Africa and the Middle East. It added 4.41pc. Auction Technology added 3.84pc. The biggest faller was Harbour Energy, down 4.55pc, followed by Ithaca Energy, down 4.42pc.\n\n04:48 PM GMT\n\nPlanning rules costing \u00a3138.5bn in growth, say economists\n\nPlanning rules that prevent existing cities from becoming more dense could be costing \u00a3138.5bn a year in lost economic growth, a report from the Adam Smith Institute has claimed.\n\nThe research, which has been endorsed by the former housing minister Sir Brandon Lewis, argues for regulations to be liberalised on the height, width, space and density of current buildings, allowing them to go up to 8 floors tall.\n\n\u201cBy increasing the number of homes in this way, and reducing their price, the UK could seriously boost its economic growth, as more workers are able to afford to live in our most productive cities, and we have more money to spend on everyday goods and services,\u201d the institute said.\n\nMaxwell Marlow, director of research at the think tank, added:\n\nThese figures are a stark reminder of just how damaging our excessively restrictive planning system has been for the UK\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nNot only is it impacting the delivery of the new homes we desperately need, it makes the building and maintaining of the infrastructure that local communities rightly want to see alongside them needlessly expensive and difficult.\n\nOur new research shows that just by densifying our cities, we can meaningfully boost Britain\u2019s GDP. Sir Brandon Lewis said there is an economic duty to build more homes - Geoff Pugh\n\n04:38 PM GMT\n\n'Mixed messages' about cars causing headaches for German manufacturers\n\nGerman exports fell sharply in December on weaker demand from eurozone countries. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at brokers Hargreaves Lansdown, explains what\u2019s going on:\n\nAs interest rates have been ramped up across Europe in response to rampant inflation, demand for goods from Germany\u2019s key industries has faltered significantly, with exports to the EU falling 5.5pc. China\u2019s fragility amid its property woes and a drop in confidence has also been hindering Germany\u2019s manufacturers, with German exports to the region dropping 7.9pc.\n\nThe reticence of EV buyers in Britain won\u2019t help German motor-manufacturers. Overall exports to the UK fell 4.3pc in December, and reticence over buying bigger ticket items like cars, parts and accessories is likely to be part of the picture.\n\nFleet buyers have been supporting overall motor manufacturing sales of EVs, but private buyers have been more reluctant to join the EV revolution. The government\u2019s decision to delay the ban on sales of fossil fuel powered vehicles certainly won\u2019t have helped, with mixed messages adding to buyer confusion. On the one hand, the incentives for companies to invest in EV fleets are generous, but deals for individual motorists have been whipped away. The production line of Volkswagen electric cars at the Volkswagen Sachsen plant in Zwickau, Germany - Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg\n\n04:22 PM GMT\n\nCarney raises $10bn to back net zero projects\n\nMark Carney has raised $10bn for an eco-friendly investment fund, as the former Bank of England governor seeks to boost funding for net zero projects. Tim Wallace reports:\n\nHis new fund has already bought a renewable energy company which runs on-shore wind farms in Scotland and the north of England, and is building solar projects across the country.\n\nThe new fund has raised $10bn so far, and follows a previous vehicle which raised $15bn from investors. Mr Carney, now chairman of Brookfield Asset Management, is understood to have helped bring in international backers including pension funds, insurers and high-net worth families.\n\nBrookfield said the new fund will invest in renewable energy, nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, and renewable natural gas, which can be made by processing manure through an anaerobic digester and harvesting the resultant methane.\n\nMr Carney, who served at the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, said the fund proves there is money to be made in the shift to net zero.\n\n\u201cWe have demonstrated beyond doubt the breadth and scale of attractive investment opportunities in the transition to a net zero economy,\u201d said Mr Carney.\n\n\u201cBy going where the emissions are, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund strategy is aiming to deliver strong risk-adjusted financial returns for investors and make meaningful environmental impacts for people and the planet.\u201d\n\nThe former Governor, who gave speeches on greening the financial system while at the Bank of England, has mounted a series of projects promoting net zero investments.\n\nHe helped launch the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance in his capacity as a UN climate envoy. The initiative aimed to encourage the industry to assess, and then reduce, their impact on the environment.\n\nBut the NZIA suffered a series of blows last year as criticism from US politicians and anti-ESG (environmental, social and governance) campaigners led some, largely American, companies to quit the group. Mark Carney believes there are attractive investment opportunities in the transition to net zero - David Rose\n\n04:17 PM GMT\n\nDollar jumps to highest level in nearly three months\n\nThe dollar climbed to its highest in almost three months against other major currencies on Monday as traders clawed back bets the US Federal Reserve would aggressively cut interest rates this year after new economic data further diminished those odds.\n\nUS services sector growth picked up in January as new orders increased and employment rebounded, suggesting economic growth momentum from the fourth quarter spilled over into the new year.\n\nThe data added to Friday\u2019s blockbuster US jobs report that far exceeded expectations and forced the market to readjust its outlook for rate cuts, the dollar\u2019s strength and how high Treasury yields, which act to bolster the US currency, can go.\n\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six other major currencies, rose to 104.59, its highest since Nov. 14, and was last up 0.53pc at 104.58.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield was last up 10 basis points at 4.478pc, after jumping 18 basis points on Friday.\n\nThe euro fell to its lowest since Nov 14 at $1.0721 and was last down 0.60pc at $1.0727.\n\nJane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, said a weak euro zone economy was also likely weighing on the euro:\n\nWe have stagnation in Germany. I think we\u2019re going into a period when it\u2019s going to be really hard for the euro to make significant gains.\n\n04:04 PM GMT\n\nAnglo American to cut costs in South Africa\n\nThe world\u2019s largest producer of platinum is reviewing its cost base in South Africa, its chief executive has said, as the country\u2019s Minerals Council warns that 4,000 and 7,000 jobs across platinum mining companies are at risk.\n\nDuncan Wanblad, the Anglo American boss, told a conference in Cape Town that declining ore grades and sharply increased input costs meant that margins could \u201cevaporate quickly\u201d. He added:\n\nWhat matters is the industry\u2019s and government\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges to ensure that the industry does survive and prosper - yes with smaller direct workforces, and this is a reality that the industry is contending with right now.\n\nAnglo American as a whole aims to cut capital expenditure by $1.8 billion by 2026, after reporting lower profits and returns for the first half of the financial year. Duncan Wanblad, chief executive of Anglo American, speaks at the Investing in African Mining Indaba in Cape Town, South Africa, today - Dwayne Senior/Bloomberg\n\n03:55 PM GMT\n\nInvestors punishing companies more than usual for missing analysts\u2019 estimates\n\nCompanies that have been missing analysts\u2019 estimates for earnings during this quarter\u2019s reporting season have been seeing their stocks get punished even more than usual, according to analaysts at Bank of America.\n\nRroughly half the companies in the S&P 500 having reported their latest quarterly results, including most of the market\u2019s most influential. Estee Lauder jumped 14pc after it reported better revenue and profit than analysts expected. McDonald\u2019s, meanwhile, fell 3.6pc despite reporting stronger profit than expected. Its revenue for the latest quarter fell just short of forecasts.\n\nAdam Vettese, an analyst at investment platform eToro, said:\n\nNot only did revenue come up slightly short of expectations, but there\u2019s an underperformance in same-store sales growth. A year ago we had growth of 10.9pc, but expectations for this most recent quarter were for a much more modest 4.7pc \u2013 unfortunately, McDonald\u2019s missed even that low bar, delivering just 3.4pc, with stores in the Middle East dragging on the global figure.\n\nThe company noted the impact of the war in the Middle East in its press release, and there are echoes here of a similar issue from Starbucks when it reported recently. Domestic sales growth was broadly in line with Wall Street expectations though.\n\n03:47 PM GMT\n\nThe Kremlin has a \u00a3200m London buy-to-let property empire\n\nHomes owned by the Russian state risk being seized in wake of unprecedented legal battle. Mark Hollingsworth has the details:\n\nAt first glance, the imposing \u00a335m Victorian Grade-II-listed mansion on Holland Park in the heart of affluent west London does not stand out. But in fact the three storey, six bedroom white stucco house has a secret history. For the past 60 years, it has been a London residency for Russian intelligence officers and diplomats.\n\nIn 1983, an MI5 officer called Michael Bettaney walked to the front gate and dropped an envelope containing security files on three Soviet agents through the letterbox. The inhabitant \u2013 KGB station chief Arkadi Gouk \u2013 assumed it was a sinister trick and ignored the approach.\n\nBut the documents were genuine. It was a crude and na\u00efve attempt to sell state secrets and the unstable Bettaney was later jailed under the Official Secrets Act.\n\nToday the Holland Park residence is still owned by the Russian state and could be embroiled in a different type of controversy in the new Cold War. The house is just one of many Russian state-owned properties in London worth an estimated total of \u00a3200m which could be seized in the light of last week\u2019s unprecedented legal charge against a plot of land in Kensington.\n\nRead the full story...

The lone exception came in December 2022.\n\nAnthony Nieves, chair of the ISM survey committee, said:\n\nThe overall growth rate increase in January is attributable to faster growth of the new orders, employment, and supplier deliveries indexes.\n\nThe majority of respondents indicate that business is steady.\n\nThey are optimistic about the economy due to the potential impact of interest rate cuts; however, they are cautious due to inflation, associated cost pressures and ongoing geopolitical conflicts.\n\nHere is some of the analyst reaction:\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 @ISM Services rebounds: 53.4 in Jan\r\n\r\n\u2705Activity 55.8 (flat)\r\n\u2705New Orders 55 (\ud83d\udd3c2.2pt)\r\n\u2705Employment 50.5 (\ud83d\udd3c6.7pt)\r\n\u2705Backlogs 51.4 (\ud83d\udd3c2pt)\r\n\u2705Supplier Deliveries 49.5 (\ud83d\udd3c2.9pt) \r\n\ud83d\udd25Inflation 64 (\ud83d\udd3c7.3pt)\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcc9Activity steady, optimism abt rate cuts, worries: inflation & geopolitics pic.twitter.com/ubZg1Ke9FY\n\n\u2014 Gregory Daco (@GregDaco) February 5, 2024\n\nISM Service \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\r\n\r\n*US JANUARY ISM SERVICES GAUGE INCREASES TO FOUR-MONTH HIGH\r\n\r\n*US ISM SERVICES PRICES-PAID INDEX RISES TO NEAR ONE-YEAR HIGH\n\n\u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) February 5, 2024\n\nBOOM!\r\n\r\nUS ISM Services PMI (Jan): 53.4 vs. 52.0 exp.

The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nChris Kempczinski, president and CEO of McDonald's, attributed the performance to the effective implementation of the Accelerating the Arches strategy. The initiative paved a path for a cumulative comparable sales growth of over 30% from 2019 levels.

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s (MCD) shares are trading lower early Monday following a less-than-stellar fourth quarter earnings report. The fast-food giant reported global same store sales and revenue that missed analyst estimates, citing turmoil in the Middle East as a major factor.\n\nYahoo Finance\u2019s Alexandra Canal reports on the numbers and the company\u2019s stance in the global market.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Let's talk a little bit more about McDonald's, the Golden Arches. Whatever you want to call them, call them down right now. By about 1.4% shares sliding this morning after global same store sales rose 3.4% during the fourth quarter. That fell short of estimates, though. The fast food giant also facing setbacks from conflicts in the Middle East. Yahoo Finance's Alexa-- Alexandra Canal has the top takeaways here. Sorry, I was thinking about this company that's usually electric.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Usually it is.\n\n- There's not so much today.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Not so much. Like you said, that surprise same store sales miss dragging down the stock today. We also saw revenue come in lower than expected. We did see a beat on the bottom line. But it's at stale, same store sales miss that analysts and Wall Street investors are really going to be focused on here. Same store sales also known as comparable sales, it's one of the most important metrics for restaurants and fast food chains.\n\nMcDonald's has consistently outperformed in that area. But we're seeing that miss in both the US and international markets. So global same store sales clocking in at 3.4%. That's lower than the expected 4.79% jump. While US sales growth came in at 4.3%. That's just shy of the 4.45% increase Wall Street had expected. So still growing, just not at the rate that analysts were looking for.\n\nAnd a big reason for that stemmed from the conflicts that are going on right now in the Middle East. This is something that CEO Chris Kempczinski alluded to prior to the earnings report. He had a LinkedIn post back in early January saying, quote, \"several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald's.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's also been boycotts over the chain's perceived pro-Israel stance. The call is currently underway right now. So I'm sure the Middle East conflict, how McDonald's plans to handle this moving forward is going to be a big emphasis on the call here. But let's get to some good news because McDonald's loyalty program, still very strong. And a big reason why we saw that beat on the bottom line their, loyalty members bringing in $6 billion in sales across 50 markets.\n\nMore than $20 billion when you look at the whole fiscal 2023, that's a 45% jump compared to 2022. So loyalty remains strong, the consumer also apparently strong in the face of price hikes and those larger check sizes due to inflation McDonald's saying in that release, quote, \"we remain confident in the resilience of our business amid macro challenges that will persist in 2024.\" So despite all of this, I think Wall Street is overall very bullish on McDonald's as a company.\n\nBut again, we'll see how they handle this same store sales miss. Because it's not something we normally see from [INAUDIBLE].\n\n- Yeah. We don't normally see and I think this might have taken the street maybe by surprise just a little bit given the fact that McDonald's is one of these names that has been relatively resilient. When you talk about the fact that consumers are trading down, they're still going into McDonald's. I'm curious also Ali, what the Street's saying about some of the softness that maybe we could see looking out to the rest of 2024.\n\nIf we're already seeing a little bit of weakness, a lot of that being driven by the Middle East and we're not getting potentially that rate cut anytime soon, putting maybe more pressure on Americans, what that would mean for a name like McDonald's.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. We already saw McDonald's hike prices in 2023. It's very possible we could see those price increases increase this year, especially as you were saying, if we don't get that rate cut, if there's more pressure on these businesses. And the Middle East conflict it's not going away anytime soon. And I think some of that pressure that we saw in the fourth quarter, it's likely going to continue in Q1.\n\nAnd hopefully we get some answers there. But I do think there are overarching risks here for the company. No, no pun intended.\n\n- Overarching risk for the Golden Arches. Ali, thanks so much.",

        "title": "McDonald's (MCD) Surpasses Q4 Earnings Estimates",
        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.95 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.59 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.98%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's biggest hamburger chain would post earnings of $3 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.19, delivering a surprise of 6.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nMcDonald's , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $6.41 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.04%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.93 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMcDonald's shares have added about 0.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4%.\n\nWhat's Next for McDonald's?\n\nWhile McDonald's has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for McDonald's: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.77 on $6.3 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $12.48 on $27.36 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Restaurants is currently in the bottom 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Shake Shack (SHAK), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 15.\n\nThis burger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +116.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 40.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nShake Shack's revenues are expected to be $280.06 million, up 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Adds share movement in paragraph 3)\n\nFeb 5 (Reuters) - McDonald's reported its first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years on Monday, squeezed by weak sales growth in its business division that includes the Middle East, China and India.\n\nHowever, the company's overall net profit rose 7% in the fourth quarter, thanks to higher menu pricing and a let up in raw material costs.\n\nShares of the burger giant were down about 2% in premarket trading.\n\nComparable sales in the company's International Developmental Licensed Markets segment rose 0.7% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, widely missing estimates of a 5.5% growth, according to LSEG data. The business accounted for 10% of McDonald's overall revenue in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski last month flagged a \"meaningful business impact\" in McDonald's Middle East market and some areas outside the region due to the Israel-Hamas conflict as well as \"associated misinformation\" about the brand.\n\nMcDonald's is among several Western brands that have seen protests and boycott campaigns against them over their perceived pro-Israeli stance. Starbucks last week cut its annual sales forecast, partly due to a hit to sales and traffic at stores in the Middle East.\n\nConsumer spending in China, McDonald's second-largest market, has also remained weak despite government support measures. Starbucks previously said a sales recovery in China was slower than its expectations.\n\nMcDonald's Indian franchisee also reported its first revenue decline in three years.\n\nMcDonald's does not break down sales in these markets.\n\nThe company's U.S. business is also starting to show signs of weakness. Traffic at McDonald's U.S. stores slumped 13% in October, according to Placer.ai data cited by Wells Fargo. It declined 4.4% and 4.9% in November and December, respectively.\n\nIts comparable sales in the U.S. climbed 4.3% in the fourth quarter, just shy of estimates of a 4.4% rise.\n\nGlobal same-store sales increased 3.4% in the quarter, missing estimates of a 4.9% rise. That represented the slowest sales growth in about three years.\n\nExcluding one-off items, McDonald's posted a per-share profit of $2.95. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.82 per share.

        "content": "McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Reports Sales Below Analyst Estimates In Q4 Earnings\n\nFast-food chain McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) fell short of analysts' expectations in Q4 FY2023, with revenue up 8.1% year on year to $6.41 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $2.95 per share, improving from its profit of $2.59 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy McDonald's? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $6.41 billion vs analyst estimates of $6.45 billion (0.7% miss) EPS (non-GAAP): $2.95 vs analyst estimates of $2.83 (4.4% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 57%, in line with the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales were up 3.4% year on year\u00a0(miss vs. expectations of up 4.7% year on year) Store Locations: 40,000 at quarter end, decreasing by 275 over the last 12 months Market Capitalization: $215.5 billion\n\n\"Our global comparable sales growth of 9% for the year is a testament to the tremendous dedication of the entire McDonald's System,\" said McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski.\n\nArguably one of the most iconic brands in the world, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food behemoth known for its convenience, value, and wide assortment of menu items.\n\nTraditional Fast Food\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nSales Growth\n\nMcDonald's is one of the most widely recognized restaurant chains in the world and benefits from brand equity, giving it customer loyalty and more influence over purchasing decisions.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 4.5% over the last four years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) was weak , but to its credit, it opened new restaurants and grew sales at existing, established dining locations.\n\nStory continues McDonald's Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, McDonald's revenue grew 8.1% year on year to $6.41 billion, missing Wall Street's expectations. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 6.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nNumber of Stores\n\nWhen a chain like McDonald's is opening new restaurants, it usually means it's investing for growth because there's healthy demand for its meals and there are markets where the concept has few or no locations. As of the most recently reported quarter, McDonald's operated 40,000 total locations, in line with its restaurant count a year ago. McDonald's Operating Retail Locations\n\nTaking a step back, McDonald's has generally opened new restaurants over the last eight quarters, averaging 1.3% annual increases in new locations. This growth is decent compared to other restaurant businesses but should be taken lightly as the industry is quite mature. Analyzing a restaurant's location growth is important because expansion means McDonald's has more opportunities to feed customers and generate sales.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is an important metric that tracks organic growth and demand for a restaurant's established locations.\n\nMcDonald's demand has outpaced the broader restaurant sector over the last eight quarters. On average, the company has grown its same-store sales by a robust 10% year on year. This performance suggests its steady rollout of new restaurants could be beneficial for shareholders. When a company has strong demand, more locations should help it reach more customers seeking its meals. McDonald's Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, McDonald's same-store sales rose 3.4% year on year. By the company's standards, this growth was a meaningful deceleration from the 12.6% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago. We'll be watching McDonald's closely to see if it can reaccelerate growth.\n\nKey Takeaways from McDonald's Q4 Results\n\nRevenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations, driven by a same-store sales miss. With better gross margins, through, EPS beat. The stock is down 1.7% after reporting, trading at $292 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in McDonald's right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry and with revenue growth of 50% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.",

        "content": "By Deborah Mary Sophia\n\n(Reuters) -McDonald's reported its first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years on Monday, squeezed by weak sales growth in its business division that includes the Middle East, China and India.\n\nThe burger giant is among several Western brands that have seen protests and boycott campaigns against them over their perceived pro-Israeli stance in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nComparable sales in McDonald's International Developmental Licensed Markets segment rose 0.7% in the quarter, widely missing estimates of a 5.5% growth, according to LSEG data. The business accounted for 10% of McDonald's total revenue in 2023.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski last month flagged a \"meaningful business impact\" in McDonald's Middle East market and some areas outside the region due to the war as well as \"associated misinformation\" about the brand.\n\n\"The effects (of the war) on earnings durability would be our biggest concern ... it looks like this is going to be an issue that persists past the next quarter or maybe even two,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which holds McDonald's shares.\n\nStarbucks last week also cut its annual sales forecast, partly due to a hit to sales and traffic at stores in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer spending in China, McDonald's second-largest market, has also remained weak despite government support measures.\n\nStarbucks previously said a sales recovery in China was slower than its expectations. McDonald's would have also seen similar trends in China in the quarter, Zacks Investment's Mulberry added.\n\nMcDonald's Indian franchisee also reported its first revenue decline in three years.\n\nChicago-based McDonald's does not break down sales in these markets.\n\nThe company's U.S. business is also starting to show signs of weakness. Traffic at McDonald's U.S. stores slumped 13% in October, according to Placer.ai data cited by Wells Fargo. It declined 4.4% and 4.9% in November and December, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparable sales in the U.S. climbed 4.3% in the fourth quarter, just shy of estimates of a 4.4% rise.\n\nStill, the company reported an adjusted profit of $2.95 per share, beating estimates of $2.82 per share.\n\n\"It's going to take some time for the results to bounce back (in the Middle East),\" Stephens analyst Joshua Long said, adding he was still positive on McDonald's stock given it is \"one of the best positioned brands\" to navigate a tricky macroenvironment.\n\nMcDonald's projected 2024 operating margin to be in the mid-to-high 40% range and expects more than 1,600 net restaurant additions this year.\n\nIt reported an operating margin of 45.7% for 2023. The company's shares were down marginally in volatile premarket trading.\n\nMcDonald's's global same-store sales increased 3.4% in the quarter, missing estimates of a 4.9% rise. That represented the slowest sales growth in about three years.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s (MCD) fans are still showing up for their Big Macs \u2014 but just not as much as Wall Street thought.\n\nThe company, which reported its Q4 results on Feb. 5, posted global same-store sales growth of 3.4%, lower than the expected 4.79% jump. Its US sales growth clocked in at 4.3%, under the 4.45% increase Wall Street anticipated.\n\nThat's in contrast to Q3, where overall same store sales increased 8.8%, beating analyst estimates at the time.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $2.95, higher than the $2.82 expected, while total revenue jumped 8% to $6.41 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2023, McDonald's reported $25.49 billion in total revenue, up 10% from $23.18 billion in 2022.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski acknowledged the current consumer environment in the earnings release: \"We remain confident in the resilience of our business amid macro challenges that will persist in 2024.\"\n\nHe also alluded to McDonald's growth plan Accelerating the Arches, saying the strategy \"has driven over 30% [of same store sales] growth since 2019.\"\n\nIn the US, Q4 sales growth were driven by larger check sizes and increased menu prices, in addition to marketing campaigns like the return of the McNugget Buddies and Happy Meal Squishmallows. For the full fiscal year, sales in the US jumped 8.7%.\n\nIn its international operated markets, Q4 same store sales increased 4.4%, down from the 12.6% growth McDonald's saw a year ago.\n\nIn its international licensed markets like Latin America and Asia, same store sales are up only 0.7%, compared to an increase of 16.5% in Q4 2022. McDonald's said sales in that segment were affected by war in the Middle East.\n\nIn early January, Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald\u2019s.\"\n\nStory continues Glennville, Georgia, McDonald's fast food restaurant customer at cashier check out. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images)\n\nMcDonald's loyalty program was key to its performance. In Q4, loyalty members brought in $6 billion in sales across 50 markets, and more than $20 billion across fiscal 2023, a 45% jump from 2022.\n\nPrior to the results, Wall Street seemed bullish on the stock.\n\nWhile fast food stocks were hammered in 2023 amid fears of softening consumer sentiment, higher food inflation like beef (which may not improve soon given a low supply of cattle), and potential impact of weight-loss drugs, McDonald's seems to find a way to forge ahead.\n\nIt's \"hard to see McDonald's not \u2018winning\u2019 in any consumer environment,\u201d Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan wrote in a client note. He projected sustained same-store sales growth in the near term, driven by menu pricing and innovation, loyalty programs, effective marketing, and operational execution and efficiencies.\n\nJefferies\u2019 Andy Barish named the stock a top pick in 2024, calling it the \"best defensive and offensive play in restaurants,\" with \"resiliency in an uncertain or weak macro [environment].\" Barish expects the chain to further invest in digital, delivery, drive-through, and chicken products.\n\nMcDonald's has been cooking up a sizzling growth plan. During its Investor Day last December, it announced a record expansion to 50,000 locations by 2027, and growing its loyalty program from 150 million to 250 million members.\n\nThe chain currently has more than 40,000 locations, with more than 39,000 of those owned by franchisees.\n\nEarnings breakdown\n\nHere's what McDonald's reported in Q4, compared to Wall Street's expectations, per Bloomberg consensus data:\n\nRevenue: $6.41 billion versus$6.45 billion expected\n\nAdjusted EPS: $2.95versus $2.82 expected\n\nGlobal same-store sales growth: 3.4% versus 4.79% expected\n\nUS same-store sales growth: 4.3% versus 4.45% expected\n\nInternational operated markets same-store sales growth: 4.4% versus 5.03% expected\n\nInternational developed licensed markets same-store sales growth: 0.7% versus 5.06% expected\n\nHere's what McDonald's reported for fiscal 2023, compared to Wall Street's expectations, per Bloomberg consensus data:\n\nRevenue: $25.49 billion versus $25.53 billion expected\n\nAdjusted EPS: $11.94 per share versus $11.78 per share expected\n\nGlobal same-store sales growth: 9.0% versus 9.41% expected\n\nUS same-store sales growth: 8.7% versus 8.81% expected\n\nInternational operated markets same-store sales growth: 9.2% versus 9.53% expected\n\nInternational developed licensed markets same-store sales growth: 9.4% versus 10.51% expected\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n\nComparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Restaurants in Russia were treated as permanently closed as of April 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable guest counts beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, McDonald's excluded results from Argentina and Lebanon in the calculation of comparable sales due to hyperinflation (Venezuela continues to be excluded). Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. Systemwide sales to loyalty members is comprised of all sales to customers who self-identify as a loyalty member when transacting with both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are measured across approximately 50 markets with loyalty programs globally. Full year Systemwide sales to loyalty members represents an annual aggregation of quarterly sales to loyalty members active in the last 90 days. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n\nFree cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.\n\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information related to the Company's results for the quarter and year ended December\u00a031, 2023.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation will broadcast its investor earnings conference call live over the Internet at 7:30 a.m. (Central Time) on February\u00a05, 2024.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fast food and quick service restaurant market, you can go directly to the 5 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants in America.\n\nWhat's Trending in the Fast Food Industry?\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global fast-food market was valued at $972.74 billion in 2021. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.05% from 2022 to 2028 and reach a value of $1.46 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.\n\nA myriad of factors contribute to the success of the fast-food industry, most significant is the demand for on-the-go convenience food and snacks. The fast-paced work and personal lives of people have drawn them to rely on ready-to-eat fast food that they can order at home or pick up from a drive-thru.\n\nThe expansion of e-commerce has significantly impacted the growth of the fast food industry. Access to the internet means that online ordering and food delivery services have increased people's reliance on fast food. These services enable consumers to fulfill their appetites without the hassle of going somewhere or interacting with others. Fast-food companies are rapidly creating their mobile applications, with easy interfaces that allow customers to order directly from their nearest location. These apps also offer discounts and other deals to their members.

The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6% during 2024-2030, reaching $454.3 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The market's growth is influenced by evolving consumer lifestyles and the increasing urban population. Disposable income levels are rising and more consumers are ready to eat out and go for fast food, which is contributing to the market\u2019s growth.\n\nThe growing working population and their busy schedules have led to a significant increase in the demand for fast food. Moreover, continuous innovation in menu offerings by fast-food restaurant chains, including new flavors, ingredients, and meal options, is attracting more customers.

        "content": "Fast-food prices in California are set to rise this spring with businesses responding to the state\u2019s $20 per hour minimum wage law for fast-food workers that will take effect on April 1, 2024.\n\nThe law was signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom last fall and will require a $20 per hour minimum wage at all restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide \u2013 though the law includes an exception for restaurants that make and sell their own bread.\n\nSeveral major fast-food franchises, including McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle, have already signaled that prices will have to rise in response to the increased labor costs.\n\n\"Everyone is going to have to pay more,\" Jack Hartung, chief financial officer of Chipotle, said in the Wall Street Journal. The California-based company expects to raise prices by about 5% to 9% more at its restaurants in the Golden State to cover the costs.\n\nCALIFORNIA CRIME WAVE TAKES ITS TOLL ON IN-N-OUT, OTHER COMPANIES AS BUSINESSES START TO ISSUE SAFETY WARNINGS Chipotle has said that a price hike of 5% to 9% was likely due to the California minimum wage law.\n\nHartung told the Journal in November that he expects Chipotle\u2019s labor costs to rise in the 15% to 20% range, which he said is \"significant enough that it puts a dent in our economics.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nHe added at the time that although he didn\u2019t see it having an immediate impact on restaurant opening plans, customers\u2019 response to price hikes will factor into those decisions. Chipotle is expected to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday.\n\nLOS ANGELES DESSERT SHOP ANNOUNCES SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LOCATIONS, CITES COST OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA\n\nMcDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on an earnings call in October that prices at the fast-food giant will have to rise even though the company hadn\u2019t determined at the time how large the increases would be.\n\n\"Certainly, there\u2019s going to be some element of that that does need to be worked through with higher pricing,\" Kempczinski said. \"There\u2019s also going to be things that I know the franchisees and our teams there are going to be looking at around productivity. How all of that plays out, there will certainly be a hit in the short term to franchisee cash flow in California; tough to know exactly what that hit will be because of some of the mitigation efforts.\"\n\nStory continues McDonald's is among the fast-food chains anticipating the need to raise prices in California due to the increased minimum wage.\n\nMcDonald's is scheduled to report earnings before the opening bell on Monday.\n\nJack in the Box said during an earnings call in November that it expects to raise prices by 6% to 8% across the company primarily to address increased wage expenses stemming from the California law. The company will likely provide an update when it releases earnings later this month.\n\nCALIFORNIA JOB GROWTH FALLS BY MOST IN THE NATION POST-PANDEMIC: REPORT Burger King is adding more kiosks to help restaurants more efficient for workers and customers.\n\nSome restaurants may turn to increased automation as a way of mitigating the impact of a higher minimum wage in the industry.\n\nJosh Kobza, the CEO of Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International, told investors during an earnings call in November that the chain plans to speed up its rollout of digital ordering kiosks, which let restaurant workers focus more on preparing food and can improve order accuracy, reducing stressful interactions between employees and customers.\n\n\"My point of view is we need to get this business to 100% digital,\" Kobza said. \"We should have all of the order-taking done through digital ordering channels over time.\"\n\nCalifornia\u2019s minimum wage ticked up to $16 an hour in January for all jobs in the state \u2013 up from $15.50 an hour which was already the highest in the nation.\n\nOriginal article source:Fast-food prices set to rise at McDonald's, Chipotle and others as California minimum wage hike looms",

        "title": "These 2 Stocks Are No-Brainer Buys, Even During a Market Crash",
        "content": "There isn't a lot that investors can know beforehand about a stock market crash except that it always catches Wall Street by surprise. You could say that this \"shock\" element is the defining characteristic of a crash, in fact, which only occurs when there's a dramatic downward shift in short-term earnings expectations.\n\nNo stock is immune to falling along with the wider market, of course. But there are some businesses that tend to do better through whatever tough selling environment that may come. Let's take a look at two of these sturdy stocks worth putting in your portfolio.\n\n1. McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's (NYSE: MCD) has been selling its signature Big Mac sandwich for over 50 years and its dividend has been growing for about the same length of time. The fast food giant has hiked its payout in each of the last 47 years, in fact.\n\nStreaks like these just aren't possible without some massive competitive advantages, which McDonald's clearly enjoys right now. A few of these include its dominant market share in a global industry, its pricing power, and its ownership of one of the most valuable brands on the planet. It also helps that Mickey D's can cater to a wide range of fast food fans through its value-priced menu and its more indulgent snacks, beverages, and meals.\n\nMcDonald's is adept at reinventing itself along with the changes in consumer preferences, most recently by boosting food quality and improving delivery and to-go speed. You can see evidence of its success in its blazing 9% comparable-store sales this past quarter.\n\nThe chain is putting up even more impressive earnings metrics as its operating profit margin moves toward 50% of sales. Investors should be happy to have a winning business like that in their portfolio, through market upturns and downturns alike.\n\n2. Procter & Gamble\n\nDon't look now, but you likely have several products in your home that were manufactured by Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG). The company dominates consumer categories that are used by millions of people each day, including paper towels, laundry detergent, diapers, skin cream, and healthcare supplies. Demand for these consumer essentials doesn't typically dive during recessions, and shoppers tend to stick to the brands they've trusted for years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNone of this is to say that P&G is a recession-proof stock. The business has been posting weaker sales volumes lately, for example, as shoppers pulled back on purchasing frequency while prices were rising in 2023.\n\nStill, P&G is winning market share in a tough selling environment. Its profitability stands well ahead of peers like Kimberly-Clark as well.\n\nThe company is highly likely to announce a decent boost to its dividend in April for its 68th consecutive raise, given expectations for strong earnings growth in the just-concluded fiscal year. Don't forget that P&G has paid a dividend since the '90s -- the 1890s, that is. This incredible streak reflects one of the big benefits of holding a prime market position in the consumer staples industry. It also suggests that shareholders will be happy to own this stock in a rally, or through the next surprise market downturn.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and McDonald's wasn't one of them.

        "title": "7 Steady Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy and Hold All Year",
        "content": "The Fed crushed expectations of lowering interest rates by holding the current rates steady. However, there are several signs of the economy improving and this could mean lower rates in the coming months. But if you want to build a resilient portfolio that survives the ups and downs of the economy, you need to consider stocks that are worth holding on to for years \u2014 like reliable blue-chip stocks. While these stocks may not be cheap, they are stable companies with a long history, impressive balance sheet and a strong business. They understand the market, have a range of products and services and have proved themselves time and again. This is what sets it apart from the other companies, and such stocks are worth holding on to for years. Let\u2019s take a look at the seven most reliable blue-chip stocks to buy and hold throughout 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) products\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest tech giants right now and its financials didn\u2019t disappoint. In the recent quarterly results, the company saw an 18% year-over-year (YOY) rise in revenue to hit $62 billion and it saw strong growth from the cloud services business.\n\nDriven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, the company saw a 61% YOY jump in gaming revenue this quarter. Azure, its cloud business also saw a revenue growth of 30% YOY. The company has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has integrated AI into its products and services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt expects to start seeing returns from this year. The company is already at its best, and MSFT stock is trading at $407 today. However, it will continue moving upward this year and is one stock that will keep rewarding you. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 0.74% making it a top choice for passive investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been writing about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a while and had recommended a buy before the quarterly results. The e-commerce giant is set to have an excellent 2024, and its recent numbers are proof. A dynamite stock for the year, it has grown the cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) at a solid pace in the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt saw a surge in revenue during the pandemic, significant lows due to high inflation and has rebounded in 2023. Amazon is firing on all cylinders, and it reported a 14% jump in revenue to hit\u00a0$170 billion ,and the EPS came in at $1. Even the sales at AWS saw a 13% jump to $24.2 billion, and this segment will continue growing throughout 2024.\n\nThe advertising revenue has been on an upward momentum since the past quarter, and it saw a 27% YOY rise in sales to a record $14.7 billion. Trading at $170 today, the stock is up 51% in the year and shows no signs of slowing.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA personal favorite and a global business, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is winning the market with loyal customers. If you have used an Apple product once, there is very little chance that you would want to switch to a different company. Apple is a solid brand and has an enviable balance sheet.\n\nThe company finally saw a surge in iPhone sales in the recent quarter and reported a revenue of\u00a0$119.6 billion with an EPS of $2.18. The iPhone sales came in at $69.7 billion but the sales have slowed down in China. Even the sales of iPads have seen a drop. However, this is temporary.\n\nApple is so much more than its devices and generates significant revenue from the Services segment. It reported a record revenue of $23.1 billion in services, and I believe this segment will continue to expand. The company is known for innovation and offering world-class products. Trading at $186 today, the stock is up 23% in the year, and this upward momentum will continue in 2024.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. . reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0stock is down 6% over the past week, and any drop in the stock is a chance to buy. The drop is due to the recently announced results where the company produced a revenue of $65.5 billion from advertising, lower than analysts\u2019 expectations. Its total revenue came in at $86.3 billion, and the operating income stood at $23.7 billion.\n\nMost of the revenue was from the advertising business, and the rest was from the search engine and the other social media products. However, the bigger picture for the company looks highly attractive, and there are many reasons to load up on the stock.\n\nThe operating income and profit are growing at a healthy rate, and the stock hit a record high last month. It has dropped since then and is trading for $142 today. The company has missed expectations but only by a small number and this is not a reason to avoid the stock. GOOG stock is a strong buy and hold.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company. reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another option in reliable blue-chip stocks. The company has had a tough ride but it has survived through it all. In 2022, it saw a drop in revenue and membership growth, but the same picked pace in 2023, and it is entering this year on a very optimistic note. It stopped password sharing and cracked down on those who accessed the service without paying, and this has helped improve the revenue numbers.\n\nIts\u00a0fourth-quarter results were also impressive. The company saw a 12.5% YOY rise in revenue growth, and the EPS came in at $2.11. Most importantly, the company added 13.1 million subscribers, its highest jump since 2020. Its growing member numbers and revenue growth are proof that this streaming giant is here to stay.\n\nIt expects an even faster growth this year while aiming for an operating margin expansion. The stock is exchanging hands for $567 and isn\u2019t cheap, but it is worth it. The stock is up 21% year-to-date (YTD) due to the quarterly results.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards. reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top fintech stocks, Visa (NYSE:V) is a solid buy in 2024. The company has been thriving despite the unpleasant macroeconomic situations. It has a strong business model where it generates revenue whenever someone uses a Visa card.\n\nThe company has a global presence and caters to more than 100 million merchants. In the recent quarterly reports, Visa reported a 9% YOY increase in revenue to $8.6 billion, while the payments volume grew by 8% and the EPS was up 20%.\n\nVisa has never disappointed in the earnings, and it is a rock-solid business that will continue to grow as we transition from cash to card. It also boasts of a dividend yield of 0.75% and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.52. Visa is also making\u00a0strategic acquisitions to enhance its position in the industry. Trading at $277, the stock is up 7% YTD.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches. reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) delicious burgers are raking in big revenue for the company. An excellent buy, the company has nailed the franchise business model and has managed to keep the operating costs down while steadily generating revenue.\u00a0It is one of the most reliable blue-chip stocks to own.\n\nIt has done well despite inflation and boasts of a strong dividend yield of 2.27%. The stock is trading close to the 52-week high at $294 today but has the potential to grow at least 25% this year. The company is set to report earnings soon and I am certain it will be a blowout quarter, driven by the holiday season. It has already beaten revenue estimates for the past three quarters with an 11% rise in sales in the previous quarter.\n\nA highly reliable business, McDonald\u2019s is generating enough cash to keep rewarding the shareholders and is one of the best brands in the market. It enjoys a pricing power and has a solid presence across the global market which ensures it stands strong in any market situation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nStocks are back near record highs with the S&P 500 finishing Friday at 4,959, its highest close ever. All three major indexes logged gains for the week, surviving a tumultuous week of trading.\n\nStocks initially slid following lackluster tech results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and sold off further on Wednesday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut in March is not the \"base case.\"\n\nBut blowout earnings from Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN), combined with a stronger-than-expected January jobs report, sent stocks into rally mode. morning brief image\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained just under 1%.\n\nA slew of corporate earnings including reports from Eli Lily (LLY), Disney (DIS), Spotify (SPOT), McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle (CMG), and Pepsi (PEP) will greet investors in the week ahead amid a light economic schedule.\n\nThe rate cut debate rolls on\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell poured cold water on investor hopes for a March interest rate cut during his press conference following the January Fed meeting. Powell said the central bank needs \"greater confidence\" in inflation's path lower before cutting rates.\n\nEconomists believe the January jobs report, which showed the US economy added 353,000 jobs in the month, bolsters the Fed's case it can wait to cut interest rates without pushing the economy into recession. But the report also brought forth concerns about inflation reaccelerating, as wages increased 4.6% in the month, the highest pace of growth since July 2023.\n\n\"After the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, we maintained confidence in our expectation of a March rate cut,\" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"After today's data, however, it is hard to see how that is going to happen. Barring a significant turnaround in the February data, or very weak inflation data between now and mid-March, it is much more likely that the FOMC will hold policy rates steady in March.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are now placing a roughly 20% chance on a interest rate cut at the March meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. On Thursday, there had been a nearly 40% chance and a month ago nearly an 80% chance.\n\nEarnings check-in\n\nCorporate earnings appeared to round a corner to end last week. After S&P 500 earnings had been posting a more than 1% decline for the quarter, a swath of earnings in the past week flipped the narrative headline with earnings beats from tech stalwarts Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, per FactSet.\n\nThe latest data from FactSet shows earnings are expected to grow 1.6% in the fourth quarter. And notably, estimates for the first quarter have been kept in check too. In the past month analysts have trimmed first quarter earnings estimates by 1.4%, less than the five-year average of a 2.1% cut.\n\n104 S&P 500 companies are slated to report earnings this week, per FactSet.\n\nMainly quiet on the economic front\n\nAfter an onslaught of economic data that's showed the US economy is off to a hot start to the first quarter, investors will have few data points to dissect in the week ahead. Weekly initial jobless claims will continue to be closely tracked as companies announce layoffs while an update on activity in the services sector on Monday will catch investor attention.

        "content": "In the last year, many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Christopher Kempczinski, sold US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$280 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$297. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Christopher Kempczinski's holding.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in McDonald's than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nMcDonald's Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at McDonald's. Specifically, insiders ditched US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of McDonald's\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. McDonald's insiders own about US$241m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About McDonald's Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold McDonald's shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that McDonald's is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - McDonald's has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.\n\nBut note: McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Earnings To Watch: McDonald's (MCD) Reports Q4 Results\n\nFast-food chain McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) will be reporting results today before the bell. Here's what you need to know.\n\nLast quarter McDonald's reported revenues of $6.69 billion, up 14% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 2.2%. It was an impressive quarter for the company, with a decent beat of analysts' revenue and EPS\u00a0estimates.\n\nIs McDonald's buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting McDonald's's revenue to grow 8.9% year on year to $6.45 billion, improving on the 1.4% year-over-year decline in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $2.83 per share. McDonald's Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have had mixed opinions about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing ten upward and four downward revisions over the last thirty days.\u00a0The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at McDonald's's peers in the restaurants segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Starbucks delivered top-line growth of 8.2% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 2.1% and Brinker International reported revenues up 5.4% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 0.4%. Starbucks traded up 2.3% on the results, and Brinker International was flat on the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Starbucks's results here and Brinker International's results here.\n\nInvestors in the restaurants segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks up on average 1.7% over the last month. McDonald's is up 2.3% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $324.5, compared to share price of $298.5.\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

We sifted through 5 online product review platforms to curate a list of high quality fast food burgers in the US. These included Yelp, OpenTable, GrubHub, TripAdvisor, and DoorDash. We sourced the rating and the number of reviews from the sources for each of the fast food brands in our list.\n\nWe then tabulated the average customer rating and total number of reviews across all five sources. The customer rating and number of reviews are a good representation of the quality and popularity of a certain fast food burger. The average rating was calculated by averaging the individual ratings across the sources. Total reviews were found by adding up the individual review count for each fast food brand across 5 sources. The list of the 15 high quality fast food burgers in the US is in ascending order of the average customer rating as a primary metric and the total number of reviews as a secondary metric.\n\nNote: It was highly challenging to extract customer ratings and reviews for specific burgers.

        "content": "McDonald's Corporation  (NYSE: MCD) is expected to release earnings results for its fourth quarter, before the opening bell on Feb. 5, 2024.\n\nAnalysts expect the fast food giant to report quarterly earnings at $2.82 per share, up from year-ago earnings of $2.59 per share. The Chicago-based company is projected to report quarterly revenue of $6.45 billion, compared to $5.93 billion in the year-earlier quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nMcDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski, last month, released a letter regarding headwinds related to war in the Middle East. In the letter, Kempczinski reflected on 2023 and warned of potential headwinds in markets in and around the Middle East.\n\n\"Several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald\u2019s,\" Kempczinski said.\n\nWith the recent buzz around McDonald's, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company\u2019s dividends. As of now, the Happy Meal innovator has a dividend yield of 2.24%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.67 a share ($6.68 a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from McDonald's dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by McDonald's $6.68 dividend: $6,000 / $6.68 = 898 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $267,676 worth of McDonald's, or 898 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $6.68 = 180 shares, or $53,654 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on MCD\n\nAlso Read:  Top 4 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Crash In January\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nMCD Price Action: Shares of McDonald's gained 1.8% to close at $298.08 on Thursday.\n\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and McDonald\u2019s Corporation MCD may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because McDonald's is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MCD in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for MCD for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81 per share.\u00a0 This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MCD, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.16% heading into earnings season.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMcDonald's Corporation price-eps-surprise | McDonald's Corporation Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that MCD has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for McDonald's, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "McDonald's Corporation MCD is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 5, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings surprise of 6.3%.\n\nHow Are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.81 per share, indicating growth of 8.5% from $2.59 reported in the year-ago quarter. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $6.47 billion. The metric suggests growth of 9.2% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at how things have shaped up in the quarter under review.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nMcDonald's fourth-quarter 2023 results are likely to benefit from strong comparable sales growth, innovative menu additions, expansion initiatives, increased average check value and menu price adjustments. Our model predicts the company\u2019s U.S and international comps in the fourth quarter to witness growth of 3.8% and 3.3% from the year-ago levels, respectively.\r\n\r\nWe expect total U.S. company-operated sales in fourth-quarter 2023 to be up nearly 3.7% from the prior-year levels to $807.3 million. Moreover, we forecast international operated markets revenues to gain 26.4% from the year-earlier levels to $1,586.1 million.\r\n\r\nMcDonald's has been proactively improving its operations in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. with the goal of increasing comparable sales. The company is achieving this by introducing value meals, customizing menus to suit local preferences, renovating restaurants, executing impactful marketing strategies and promotions, elevating service quality, and offering enhanced convenience through strengthened digital presence and delivery services. These initiatives are expected to have positively impacted the company's performance in the fourth quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nHowever, fourth-quarter margins might have suffered due to continued pressure from elevated commodities and wages. Our model predicts adjusted operating margin in fourth-quarter 2023 to be 43.5% compared with 43.6% in the prior-year quarter. A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates, remains a headwind.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMcDonald's Corporation price-eps-surprise | McDonald's Corporation Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for McDonald's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nMcDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some other stocks worth considering from the Zacks Retail-Wholesale space, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.\r\n\r\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG has an Earnings ESP of +1.30% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nCMG\u2019s earnings for the quarter under review are expected to increase 17.1%.

        "content": "Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) stock has underperformed the market, but the stock has a lot of potential, starting with its 5.2% dividend yield. Contrarian investors will find that there\u2019s quite a bit to like here. I\u2019m bullish on the $3.9 billion fast food stock, given its juicy dividend yield, its relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its restaurant stock peers, and several catalysts that could lead to a turnaround, such as a new CEO taking over and new involvement from activist investors who could push for further changes.\n\nNew CEO, New Activist Investors\n\nWendy\u2019s stock has slumped to a 14.0% loss over the past year, at a time when the S&P 500 (SPX) surged to a 21.8% gain, so some changes are likely needed, and changes are coming.\n\nWendy\u2019s recently announced that a new CEO, Kirk Tanner, will take the helm on February 5. Tanner has been at Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) for over 30 years and is currently leading the company\u2019s massive North American beverage business. While it\u2019s too early to say what Tanner\u2019s strategy will be, he appears to have the right kind of background for this role, and a fresh start under a new CEO could help to reinvigorate the business and the stock price.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly precedent for this in the restaurant industry. For example, former Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol took over as Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) CEO in 2018 and has created tremendous value for shareholders in that time. Chipotle\u2019s stock price has more than tripled since he took over. I\u2019m not saying that this move by Wendy\u2019s will necessarily have the same level of impact, but the example shows that a change in leadership can be a catalyst for stocks in this industry.\n\nIn terms of other potential catalysts (or wildcards), Wendy\u2019s is also facing renewed pressure from activist investors, which could benefit shareholders.\n\nWhile legendary investor Nelson Peltz (who is now Wendy\u2019s Chairman of the Board) dropped his efforts to take the company private, a new activist is engaging in saber-rattling of its own. In December, Reuters reported that Blackwells Capital, an activist hedge fund, has plans to challenge Wendy\u2019s Board of Directors (namely Peltz) and to push for various improvements, although it\u2019s unclear what they are at this time.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say what the dynamic between the new CEO, Peltz, and the new activists will be, but with all of these new elements in play, more changes are likely on the horizon.\n\nTasty Dividend\n\nWhat I really like about Wendy\u2019s stock is that it packs a punch with its dividend. Shares of Wendy\u2019s currently yield an attractive 5.2%.\n\nThis yield is well above that of the average yield for the S&P 500 (SPX), which currently sits at 1.5%.\n\nNot only that, but Wendy\u2019s also yields significantly more than its closest peers like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) (TSE:QSR), the parent company of Burger King, which yield 2.1% and 2.8%, respectively.\u00a0Wendy\u2019s yield is also significantly higher than that of Taco Bell parent Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), which currently yields just 1.9%.\n\nWendy\u2019s doubled its dividend payout in 2023 (from $0.125 per quarter to $0.25), a strong signal that it is committed to creating value for its shareholders. In addition to this big-time dividend, Wendy\u2019s is also returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2023, Wendy\u2019s committed to buying back $500 million worth of shares through 2027, a significant amount for a company with a $3.9 billion market cap.\n\nCheaper Than the Market and Fast Food Peers\n\nTrading at 19.3 times earnings and 17.3 times projected 2024 earnings, shares of Wendy\u2019s aren\u2019t so cheap that value investors are going to be pounding the table over it, but they are cheaper than the broader market and those of its closest peers.\n\nThe S&P 500 currently trades at 22.1 times earnings. McDonald\u2019s trades at 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.3 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International trades at 23.7 times trailing earnings and 22.4 times forward earnings. Similarly, YUM! Brands trades at 24.3 times trailing earnings and 22.2 times forward earnings.\n\nThese comparisons illustrate that there is plenty of room for Wendy\u2019s to attain a higher multiple in line with its restaurant peers and for shares to trade higher if the new management team can right the ship.\n\nIs WEN Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, WEN earns a Hold consensus rating based on three Buys, 11 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average WEN stock price target of $21.73 implies 13.9% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: Wendy\u2019s Stock Looks Attractive\n\nShares of Wendy\u2019s look attractive based on its 5.2% dividend yield and the possibility that changes driven by its new CEO or by activist investors could help bring its valuation more in line with those of its peers.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "The upcoming report from McDonald's (MCD) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.82 per share, indicating an increase of 8.9% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $6.47 billion, representing an increase of 9.2% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.2% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some McDonald's metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenues- Total Franchised revenues' will reach $3.90 billion.

Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 40,275 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Comparable sales growth - International Operated Markets - YoY change' will reach 4.6%.

The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 16.5%.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Comparable sales growth - Total - YoY change' to come in at 4.5%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 12.6% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Systemwide restaurants - Total International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate' will reach 17,975. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 16,728.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Systemwide restaurants - Total International Operated Markets' will likely reach 10,291. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 10,103.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Systemwide restaurants - Total U.S.' at 13,471.

        "content": "By Nandan Mandayam and Ashna Teresa Britto\n\nBENGALURU, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Indians are going out less often for pizzas and burgers, third-quarter results at Domino's and McDonald's local franchisees showed on Wednesday, with analysts noting that tough competition and demand-dampening inflation would strain their earnings in the near term.\n\nDomino's restaurants operator Jubilant Foodworks reported a surprise profit fall, while Westlife Foodworld , which operates McDonald's restaurants in south and west India, posted a bigger-than-expected profit drop.\n\nQuick-service restaurant (QSR) operators in the country have done everything from rolling out cheaper offerings and increasing discounts to cutting packaging costs in a bid to prop up demand but have failed to get Indians to eat out more often amid high inflation.\n\nThe same companies were among the biggest beneficiaries during last year's festive session as Indians began dining out more often after several pandemic-ridden years.\n\nThe demand slowdown after 2023's high base has not only dragged their earnings, but has also resulted in negative same-store-sales growth (SSSG) compared to the usual 5%.\n\nWhile demand weakness \"might be near the bottom,\" the industry is unlikely to reach earlier SSSG growth, said Karan Taurani, an analyst with Elara Capital.\n\nThe margins of the two companies are also unlikely to see a \"significant recovery,\" according to Amnish Agarwal, analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, with Taurani also adding that intensifying competition from smaller players would keep margins \"strained.\"\n\nJubilant's profit of 657.1 million rupees ($7.9 million) was down for a fifth straight quarter, much lower than analyst estimates of 902.6 million rupees, while its revenue growth slowed for the seventh quarter in a row.\n\nWestlife, meanwhile, reported its first revenue fall in three years and its profit of 172.4 million rupees came in far below analyst estimates of 331.1 million rupees, as per LSEG data.\n\n($1 = 83.0180 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Nandan Mandayam and Ashna Teresa Britto in Bengaluru; Editing by Sohini Goswami and Janane Venkatraman)",

        "title": "A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, McDonald's fair value estimate is US$255 Current share price of US$295 suggests McDonald's is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$323 analyst price target for MCD is 27% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for McDonald's\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$8.84b US$9.80b US$10.4b US$11.4b US$12.1b US$12.7b US$13.2b US$13.6b US$14.1b US$14.5b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 6.10% Est @ 4.93% Est @ 4.12% Est @ 3.55% Est @ 3.15% Est @ 2.87% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3%  US$8.2k US$8.4k US$8.2k US$8.2k US$8.1k US$7.8k US$7.5k US$7.2k US$6.8k US$6.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$14b\u00d7 (1 + 2.2%) \u00f7 (8.3%\u2013 2.2%) = US$241b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$241b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$108b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$185b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$295, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.225. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for McDonald's\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) closed at $294.65 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.8% move from the prior day.

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.35%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.76%.\n\nThe world's biggest hamburger chain's stock has dropped by 1.42% in the past month, falling short of the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.86% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.36%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of McDonald's in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on February 5, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.81, up 8.49% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.47 billion, up 9.24% from the year-ago period.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.23, so one might conclude that McDonald's is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, we should mention that MCD has a PEG ratio of 2.59.

As of the close of trade yesterday, the Retail - Restaurants industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.84.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 159, putting it in the bottom 37% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "title": "7 Retirement Stocks to Anchor Your Portfolio for Life",
        "content": "When building a retirement portfolio, we all want investments that can stand the test of time. The ideal stocks to hold the long-haul deliver stable returns while providing regular income via dividends. As our portfolios grow over the decades, these dividends can compound into an exponential source of passive income. Of course, we also need stocks sturdy enough to weather any storms the market may bring.\n\nIn my experience, the keys to identifying retirement portfolio anchors are finding companies with essential products and services, loyal customer bases, and strong balance sheets. Businesses like these are poised to keep generating profits across the ups and downs of economic cycles. As a bonus, look for stocks with a history of raising their dividend payments year after year. Here are seven such stocks I think fit most investors\u2019 retirement portfolios right now.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs you build your retirement portfolio, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) should be one of the first stocks you look to as an essential anchor. This beverage and snacks giant has been a stalwart holding for many long-term investors, delivering stable returns plus a growing dividend stream. Even in turbulent market environments, PepsiCo continues marching higher over the long-run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhen you think of PepsiCo, of course, the first products that come to mind are Pepsi sodas and other iconic beverage brands like Gatorade and Aquafina. However, many investors fail to realize that the company owns an even more expansive snacks and packaged foods business. Walk down any grocery store aisle, and you\u2019ll notice how many bagged chips, dips, crackers, and other tasty treats are manufactured by PepsiCo. It\u2019s a dominant force in the consumer staples industry.\n\nDespite its massive size and maturity, PepsiCo shows no signs of slowing down in terms of its growth. In the company\u2019s latest quarterly report, revenue grew nearly 7% year-over-year while profits surged 14%. Management continues to impress by expanding through new product innovation and strategically entering developing global markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother detail you\u2019ll love about PepsiCo is its best-in-class 87% gross margin, demonstrating unmatched pricing power and efficiency advantages versus its peers. PepsiCo is also a Dividend King, with 52 consecutive years of payout hikes under its belt. The company\u2019s current yield sits at a tasty 3%, providing investors with a reliable passive income stream.\n\nConsidering slower economic growth forecasts for 2024, many stocks could face headwinds. But PepsiCo boasts an extremely resilient business model that performs even better during downturns as consumers flock to snack and beverage indulgences. Thus, PEP stock appears poised to continue delivering market-beating returns for your portfolio, making it a cornerstone holding for those looking forward to retirement.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Caterpillar (CAT) excavator vehicle backlit by sunset\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nYou should also look to industrial stocks like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to hold as a core long-term portfolio anchor. Caterpillar supplies heavy construction machinery essential to infrastructure projects all over the globe. As governments and corporations ramp up spending to modernize aging structures and systems, demand for Caterpillar\u2019s iconic yellow bulldozers, excavators, and loaders surges higher.\n\nIn recent years, the passage of numerous infrastructure bills has laid the foundation for sustained growth in companies like Caterpillar. While these multi-trillion dollar packages took some time to negotiate, funds are now steadily being dispersed and put to work fixing roads, bridges, ports, and more here in the U.S. Many contractors utilize Caterpillar equipment, so these ambitious public works plans translate to big business for the industry giant. Upgrades to things like the power grid and water pipelines also can\u2019t be done without Caterpillar\u2019s machinery by construction crews\u2019 sides.\n\nSure enough, the company\u2019s latest financial results showed stellar momentum, with sales up 12% year-over-year and earnings per share jumping 37%. Both metrics came in well above expectations. Caterpillar boasts leading profitability metrics for its sector, with net margins of more than 16.6%, compared to just 4.8% for its average peer. There\u2019s good reason to be confident this stock still has room to run higher as infrastructure activity continues ramping up over the next decade. Notably, Caterpillar has also hiked its dividend for 29 straight years, recently yielding 1.7% with a moderate payout ratio.\n\nFor investors seeking industrial sector exposure plus income generation, CAT stock checks all the boxes as a long-term portfolio anchor. You\u2019d do well to buy shares on any pullbacks, benefitting from the upcoming waves of infrastructure modernization both domestically and worldwide.\n\nFTAI Aviation (FTAI) Image of white paper airplanes on horizontal trajectory with one red paper airplane rising upward, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pasuwan\n\nFTAI Aviation (NASDAQ:FTAI) operates an essential yet behind-the-scenes business leasing commercial aircraft engines and components. It\u2019s the quintessential \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d play that still offers explosive growth potential in the years ahead. While buying airline stocks involves notable risks, FTAI provides diversified exposure to global air travel activity without the volatility seen in individual carriers.\n\nSpecializing mainly in leasing the ubiquitous CFM56 engine, FTAI owns the world\u2019s largest independent pool of these engines deployed in passenger and cargo jets across 30 international airlines. Through purchasing engines and components when prices are depressed and then leasing them out at higher rates, FTAI enjoys strong profitability and cash flows. The company uses stable earnings to secure cheap financing for its long-term expansion at rates unattainable by regular airlines.\n\nOver the last two years, FTAI has managed to quadruple revenue. Consequently, the stock price has soared over 260% since Sept. 2022. However, don\u2019t let the big run fool you \u2013 there\u2019s still plenty of upside ahead. Based on 2025 earnings projections, shares trade at only 17-times forward earnings once explosive bottom-line growth is accounted for. Capital continues pouring into new investments as management deploys cash into more engine assets.\n\nWith global travel demand forecasted to expand further beyond, FTAI Aviation finds itself in an airline industry \u201csweet spot\u201d for lessors like itself. The company still only commands a small single-digit percentage of total engine value in the market. Plus, shareholders enjoy an escalating dividend currently yielding 2.2% annually. For these reasons, FTAI deserves a strong buy rating and warrants accumulation on any dips. This engine lessor gives your portfolio valuable aviation industry exposure without keeping you up at night worrying about bankruptcies.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.\n\nSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen building a retirement portfolio to weather any storm, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a must-buy anchor to stabilize your holdings. This fast food leader has proven repeatedly that its business not only survives downturns but actually thrives as consumers flock to affordable indulgences. Throughout recessions, McDonald\u2019s has shown the ability to continue growing both sales and profits.\n\nEven during 2020\u2019s unprecedented pandemic, which decimated the restaurant industry, McDonald\u2019s surpassed its pre-COVID share price by September 2020 thanks to drive-thrus, deliveries, and digital investments. Today, with high inflation and interest rates squeezing lower-income households worldwide, McDonald\u2019s sustains strong momentum, growing Q3 2023 revenue by 14% year-over-year, and earnings by an even more impressive 19%.\n\nBeyond its impressive resilience, McDonald\u2019s has aggressively repurchased shares, with over $1 billion spent last quarter alone. Its dividend has grown for 48 straight years, currently yielding 2.3% with room to increase further.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s offers the essential brand power and financial strength to emerge stronger from any crisis for a retirement portfolio built to deliver through thick and thin. Indeed, MCD stock provides you with an oasis of stability (plus growth) in turbulent times.\n\nItochu (ITOCF) Itochu Corporation office building in Japan. ITOCF stock.\n\nSource: Takashi Images / Shutterstock\n\nItochu (OTCMKTS:ITOCF) is a great stock to help diversify your core retirement holdings with global reach. This Japanese trading conglomerate deals in various products, from clothes to machines, metals, food, chemicals, and energy. Ranked among the largest and oldest companies worldwide, Itochu leverages its scale and connections to drive steady profits across sectors.\n\nIts wide array of business lines provide resilience across economic cycles, while ventures in essential categories like food and energy ensure stable demand. Itochu has delivered reliable growth for long-term shareholders through sound strategy execution. While revenue and earnings growth appears to be modest at first glance, consistency is key for a lifetime investment.\n\nGiven its strong cash flows, Itochu rewards loyal investors with a secure 2.65% dividend yield. The stock isn\u2019t exactly cheap today, but reasonable valuations for such a diversified business capable of navigating just about any environment the future holds. I\u2019m confident Itochu\u2019s diversity and dividends will help anchor overall portfolio returns over the decades to come.\n\nAirbus (EADSY) An image of a futuristic aerospace engine rendering\n\nSource: solarseven / Shutterstock\n\nMany overlook aerospace stocks as retirement portfolio pillars, given industry volatility. However, I believe Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) deserves consideration as a potential portfolio anchor. Commercial air travel demand shows no signs of disappearing. And with arch-rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) faltering recently amidst crashes and technical failures, Airbus looks primed to capture more global market share.\n\nThe company booked over $163 billion in new airplane orders last year, implying a packed production schedule for years ahead. Helped by Boeing ceding ground, analysts forecast Airbus will grow revenue by 12% in 2023 and sustain double-digit revenue growth through 2026. Earnings per share could more than double between 2023 and 2025 as operating leverage kicks in. Based on 2025 profit estimates, EADSY stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of around just 5-times. That\u2019s an absolute steal for a high-flying firm dominating a critical global duopoly.\n\nWhile airline manufacturers tend to be cyclical, Airbus appears positioned in the driver\u2019s seat to capitalize on growing long-term air travel while taking share from a stumbling giant.\n\nAaon (AAON) Person working on metal in the dark, with sparks flying. industrial stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSticking with essential-for-life products, Aaon (NASDAQ:AAON) manufactures specialized heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment for large facilities. With summers becoming hotter by the year, demand rises for high-grade cooling systems. AAON customizes premium HVAC products capable of large-scale climate control with energy efficiency advantages.\n\nBusiness is booming, with Q3 sales up almost 29% year-over-year and profit growth topping 75% last quarter. Bolstered product margins led to an impressive earnings beat this past quarter as well. Thanks to a pristine balance sheet carrying little debt and substantial profitability, AAON is structurally set up to provide sustainable long-term growth.\n\nThough only currently yielding 0.45%, this is a company with a dividend that\u2019s still notable. Savvy investors can ride surging HVAC demand over decades as climate change necessitates advanced systems like these.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Ahead of February Earnings",
        "content": "This earnings season is particularly mixed, making the list of stocks to watch before earnings especially impactful if you\u2019re interested in directional trades. Even if not, keeping a close watch on some major stocks ahead of their earnings date can help give you a better idea of how the overall market landscape is developing \u2013 for good or for bad.\n\nThe S&P 500 is marking all-time highs, and of the companies in the index that reported thus far, nearly 70% posted a positive EPS surprise. Great news, right?\n\nDespite individual company strengths (or analysts\u2019 misaligned expectations), the index\u2019s collective earnings marked a 1.4% year-over-year (YoY) decline \u2013 not a particularly bullish indicator, considering how different the sentiment was this time last year. Likewise, though many companies have yet to report, a sizeable percentage are offering negative EPS guidance as they face greater uncertainty than current index pricing indicates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat all this means is that, increasingly, we can\u2019t rely on a \u201cstocks go up\u201d theory of earnings when evaluating short-term trades. At the same time, though, some overbought individual stocks seem to be a house of cards propping up a shaky market \u2013 making bets on them a risky proposition.\n\nHere are a handful of top stocks to watch before earnings \u2013 alongside whether or not they\u2019re worth a buy at this stage in the game.\n\nBuy: Palantir (PLTR)\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, February 5th (After Hours) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the many well-known stocks reporting in February, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is the easiest to call a Buy today. After four consecutive profitable quarters, the AI and data analytics software firm is well on its way to marking its fifth. Right now, analysts are projecting earnings roughly aligned with last quarter\u2019s, which hit a $0.07 EPS. If the thesis bears out, that represents a 100% jump on a YoY basis, which supports the collective consensus that the company will grow 85% annually over the next five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA major tailwind for Palantir is that it\u2019s now eligible for S&P 500 inclusion after four consecutive profitable periods. Palantir is already larger, by market cap, than 3/5 of the current index holdings. At the same time, applied AI will likely continue propelling Palantir forward. In many cases, the AI bubble is borderline bursting \u2013 \u201cnormal\u201d companies, i.e., those without a clear AI use case, failed to demonstrate how adopting current AI tech benefited their bottom line. That\u2019s despite the constant usage of AI-adjacent buzzwords in marketing materials and earnings calls.\n\nBut Palantir is one of the few companies with a clear, demonstrable, and viable AI platform that existed well before the current craze. Palantir\u2019s wide-ranging AI offerings help across unique use cases, including combat targeting, intelligence, corporate data insight, public health forecasting, and more. As investors lose enthusiasm for AI labeling stamped across every company\u2019s face, Palantir stands out as one of the few that will weather the imminent drawdown.\n\nSell before Earnings: Chipotle (CMG)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, February 6th (After Hours) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) consumer sentiment is slowly turning against Chipotle, as a cursory social media search sees scores of dissatisfied customers complaining about slow and incorrect orders, poor ingredient quality, and a general feeling that the once-hot burrito company isn\u2019t what it used to be. This is likely due, in no small part, to increased emphasis on cost-cutting at the expense of what made Chipotle the hot stock it is today. Of course, quantifying social sentiment of this type is difficult, but a look at CMG\u2019s fundamentals reinforces a Sell rating.\n\nFrom the outset, CMG\u2019s basic ratios skew far too high for comfort, trading at 55x earnings and 22x book value. Likewise, it trades at 1.75x earnings growth \u2013 all of which indicates gross overvaluation in light of its relatively precarious position as a pricy fast food alternative, social sentiment aside. The company\u2019s YoY EPS growth is strong, to be sure \u2013 nearly 40% in last year\u2019s report, but the stat is trending downward to align itself more closely with CMG\u2019s 10-year growth average of just 13.86%.\n\nUltimately, Chipotle is a restaurant mainstay, and the stock isn\u2019t going anywhere soon. But its current per-share price is far too overblown to be worth investing in now, and if you\u2019re a shareholder, I\u2019d be concerned that just a hint of bad news could send shares tumbling faster than it takes to order a burrito bowl.\n\nBuy: McDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, February 5th (Pre-Market) Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.\n\nSource: Gargantiopa / Shutterstock\n\nOn the fast food flip side, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) remains a strong Buy as it prepares to be one of the first stocks reporting earnings in February. Across the board, top analysts are bullish on McDonald\u2019s. One Wedbush analyst said that it\u2019s \u201chard to see McDonald\u2019s not \u2018winning\u2019 in any consumer environment.\u201d At the same time, a Jefferies rating expert took to CNBC to call McDonald\u2019s a top pick in the restaurant industry as the \u201cbest defensive and offensive play in restaurants,\u201d with \u201cresiliency in an uncertain or weak macro [economic climate].\n\nBut the widely enthusiastic endorsement isn\u2019t backed up by MCD\u2019s per-share pricing; the stock climbed just under 8% over the preceding 12 months and lost about 2% since January 1st. A tough 2022 didn\u2019t help the cause, as McDonald\u2019s posted an annual revenue and income decrease alongside a slim margin improvement. But, on the heels of right-sizing operations and improved economic outlook, analysts expect the company to post a 7% EPS jump and 9% revenue growth in its upcoming earnings.\n\nSell before Earnings: PayPal (PYPL)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (After Hours) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the CEO\u2019s plans to \u201cshock the world,\u201d PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) seems destined to disappoint this earnings season. In a bizarre attempt to ape Steve Jobs\u2019 vibe, the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in payment processing turned out to be new checkout procedures that \u201c[replace] cumbersome password inputs with biometric alternatives like face or fingerprint recognition.\u201d That\u2019s right \u2013 PayPal\u2019s revolutionary news is that it finally caught up to a range of existing applications that offer exactly that.\n\nUnsurprisingly, shares dipped slightly after the underwhelming Innovation Day proceedings, though the stock is up slightly since the month began. But it may not stay solid for long, as PayPal\u2019s house of cards could quickly crack on just a hint of poor outcomes. PayPal\u2019s market share domination sets it apart from the competition, to be fair. But competition is increasing, and though PayPal tends to be a top pick for computer-based payment processing, it lags significantly on mobile \u2013 where the bulk of tomorrow\u2019s digital shoppers buy things today (see the next paragraph for specifics!).\n\nBuy: Apple (AAPL)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 1st (After Hours) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough I alluded to the company in the previous paragraph, Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent pivots point to long-term strength that makes the stock a buy despite its fairly high per-share pricing. Specifically, Apple\u2019s emphasis on services \u2013 like Apple Pay and its podcasting platform \u2013 represents a cheap, high-margin flywheel that\u2019s already dominating some specific consumer sectors.\n\nThe top-line stats for Apple Pay alone are, frankly, astonishing. They reinforce the bull thesis for Apple while cementing PayPal\u2019s increasing irrelevance to tomorrow\u2019s shopping ecosystem. Apple Pay has already captured 92% of the digital wallet marketplace, processing 12.6% of all online consumer payments in 2023, with 48% of customers using the digital wallet for in-person transactions. Those stats mark a new age for Apple while signaling a death knell for PayPal\u2019s past dominance.\n\nFrom a hardware perspective, Apple is also focusing on creating greater verticals throughout its supply chain to protect against the kind of geopolitical shock we see with increased regularity. The company\u2019s renewed in-house component production efforts will help it cut costs while ensuring quality and, of course, protect against supply chain shocks moving forward.\n\nSell before Earnings: Alibaba Group (BABA)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (Pre-Market) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nSaying that Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is a Sell is a tough call. On one hand, the company\u2019s per-share pricing is closer than ever to its IPO debut cost and worth just a third of its 2020 high. And, unlike many other ZIRP-era high flyers, BABA isn\u2019t a flash in the pan.\n\nUnfortunately, pure economic risk in China puts too much pressure on this stock to make it worth buying before earnings. And, while that topic is a bit too complex to look at, other factors are pressuring BABA stock that make it worth selling before earnings.\n\nDespite its size, there\u2019s little real moat involved in BABA\u2019s operational model. That\u2019s clear as a primary competitor, Piunduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) beat BABA as the top eCommerce stock in China. Both companies\u2019 core value proposition is rock-bottom pricing. But, while BABA focused on overseas manufacturing, Piunduoduo\u2019s China-specific emphasis lets it snag market share away. At the same time, those supply chain shocks mentioned in the last paragraph pressure BABA\u2019s overseas shipments, and companies are increasingly looking elsewhere, like Latin America, for scaled production.\n\nSell: Affirm Holdings (AFRM)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 8th (After Hours) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nI covered the Sell thesis behind Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) last week, but it\u2019s worth revisiting before the company posts earnings. This is also a fairly contrarian position, as the stock surged more than 185% over the past year. But I think this bubble is about to burst soon, if not after this upcoming earnings report.\n\nYou probably recognize that Affirm\u2019s core business revolves around its buy now, pay later (BNPL) model. This model essentially provides consumers with short-term micro-loans at the point of sale. However, for better or worse, the BNPL solutions tend to attract consumers with less-than-stellar credit. With credit card delinquency rates on the rise, it seems inevitable that Affirm will face a surge in unpaid BNPL loans.\n\nAffirm\u2019s latest financial statements reveal a significant increase in its allowance for credit losses (expected delinquency write-offs), which surged by over 10% year-over-year. This uptick occurred even before the holiday sales season when tons of consumers undoubtedly maxed out their credit cards and relied heavily on Affirm\u2019s BNPL services. Given the current consumer and macroeconomic trends, the short-term outlook for Affirm appears bleak, positioning it as one of the top stocks to sell before earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis Mexican food chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.49 billion, up 14.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.27% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chipotle?\n\nFor Chipotle, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.30%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Chipotle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Chipotle would post earnings of $10.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $11.36, delivering a surprise of +8.60%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nChipotle appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, McDonald's (MCD) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.47 billion, up 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for McDonald's has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.16%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that McDonald's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "On Jan. 22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day above 38,000 for the first time in history. The strong performance of the index and historical highs suggest that 2024 will be very strong.\n\nIt also leads investors to wonder which stocks among the 30 listed on the Dow are worth buying and which are worth selling.\n\nGenerally, the U.S. stock market should be robust in 2024. The Dow Jones represents 30 prominent companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Thus, record levels imply overall strength in the U.S. economy. Let\u2019s look at seven Dow stocks and where they\u2019re headed soon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently made news as the stock\u2019s market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Such a high valuation raises the question of whether Microsoft can rise further.\n\nIt can.\n\nInvestors will be unsurprised to hear the reason: Artificial intelligence. Hear me out, though. Microsoft continues to have a lot of opportunities related to AI. The primary opportunity is that of monetization.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to argue that the difference between\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft, as it relates to AI and valuation, is monetization. Microsoft\u2019s current P/E ratio is just below 40 times. Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s P/E ratio is above 81 times.\n\nNvidia commands a higher premium due to the monetization of AI. Thus, the more Microsoft can monetize AI, the higher its shares can rise. Of course, Microsoft has done so with its monetization of CoPilot. However, that hasn\u2019t been nearly as successful as Nvidia\u2019s monetization through chip sales, which remain in high demand for AI applications.\n\nIt\u2019s an opportunity for Microsoft, arguably making it a buy at the moment despite recently surpassing a $3 trillion valuation.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.\n\nSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s a bad idea to bet against\u00a0McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock right now. The Golden Arches are operating very well at the moment and are also seeking real, substantial growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors considering McDonald\u2019s a boring, slow-growth firm should think again. In December, the company announced that It plans to increase its footprint to 50,000 restaurants by 2027. That will be its\u00a0fastest period of growth in history.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s also evident that McDonald\u2019s is attempting to win back market share from competitors\u2014namely,\u00a0Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). The company continues to test its CosMc\u2019s restaurant concept. Long wait times suggest that the restaurant concept has the potential to rest market share from Starbucks with its expansive drinks menu.\n\nAll of that positive news follows a Q3 earnings report, which showed an\u00a011% increase in global system-wide sales. It is little wonder that some analysts expect 2024 will be very strong for McDonald\u2019s, which has caused them to up their ratings.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is little reason to believe that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock should rise soon. Salesforce is in something of a dead zone despite its strong performance of late.\n\nIn the third quarter, Salesforce provided better-than-expected results, including\u00a0revenues that increased by 11% to $8.7 billion. The better-than-expected performance provided the company the confidence to raise guidance for multiple metrics. That\u2019s all on top of a year that saw Salesforce shares amongst the best performers on the Dow Jones Index.\n\nThe problem is Salesforce\u2019s revenues are expected to grow by 10% in Q4. That\u2019s not a strong enough catalyst to propel CRM shares higher. Instead, investors should look forward to rate cuts expected to begin in June per most consensus opinions.\n\nLower lending rates should Galvanize greater investment in customer relationship management overall. Salesforce continues to\u00a0heavily tout its AI investment in that regard. Furthermore, it\u2019s also the dominant force in the space. However, investors are going to have to wait a few months for that catalyst to kick in.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) An image of a tan building corner with a blue \"P&G\" logo, an American flag on a post, and two larger building tops in the background under a dark blue sky.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs long as consumers are willing to absorb higher prices, there\u2019s no reason to bet against\u00a0Procter & Gamble\u2019s (NYSE:PG) stock.\n\nThat\u2019s the message that the market sent upon P&G\u2019s Jan. 23 earnings release. Sales grew by a modest 3% during the most recent quarter, but that didn\u2019t matter despite being a slight miss. What did matter is that Procter & Gamble continues to be able to pass higher prices on to consumers, leading to improved net income.\n\nP&G now expects that net income growth will range between 8 and 9%. It had expected the range to be between 6% and 9% prior. Consumers continue to absorb price increases for their favorite fast-moving goods brands.\n\nThat was the primary takeaway of the stock market on Jan. 23. Shares jumped from $147 to $155 on the earnings release and the news contained therein. Procter & Gamble will continue to rise because consumers remain undeterred.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nResilient consumers are also the primary positive factor for Visa (NYSE:V). Its stock is rising after releasing earnings that showed better than anticipated results. The reason: strong consumer credit spending.\n\n2023 was the year of strong consumerism fueled by credit spending. 2024 is shaping up to be no different. Visa saw its\u00a0revenues increase by 9% in the first quarter on especially strong cross-border payment volume. American consumers continue to travel in record numbers following the pandemic.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that if a recession is avoided entirely, consumer credit spending plays a large part in the result. Further, net income increased by 17% during the period.\n\nWhile many companies are looking for ways to find greater efficiency at the moment, Visa has no such problem. Its bottom line results reflect that truth. Again, there\u2019s no reason to bet against Visa, given consumer credit usage over the past year.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarly expectations suggest that the Vision Pro will be another success for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, it\u2019s unlikely that the Vision Pro will do much to send AAPL stock higher in the near term.\n\nFurther, despite strong early pre-release sales, it\u2019s also likely that Vision Pro demand will be limited. Current demand data based on pre-release sales suggest that\u00a0early enthusiasm is limited to developers and power users.\n\nThe Vision Pro was never expected to be a vital contributor to Apple\u2019s top line at any rate. Apple analysts expect the company to easily sell more than 500,000 headsets, priced at $3,500 apiece. That\u2019s not much for a company of Apple\u2019s stature.\n\niPhone sales continue to be Apple\u2019s bread and butter. Fortunately for Apple investors, there is good news. The iPhone is\u00a0now the most popular brand in China. That\u2019s particularly good news: Apple had courted other populous Asian nations as China\u2019s economy struggled during 2023.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is currently engaged in a period of growth through consolidation. The company recently agreed to purchase Hess (NYSE:HES) for $60 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a larger wave of consolidation in the energy sector. It\u2019s also one that has\u00a0drawn the attention of antitrust investigators. While there is no clear indication of the potential outcome, one thing should be noted.\n\nLarge energy firms had a banner year in 2022 after a long dry spell. 2023 was a problematic year again. 2024 is offering signs that are both positive and negative. Demand could remain weak, however, simultaneously, so your political tensions remain high, and crude oil prices have risen lately.\n\nAll things considered, it\u2019s fair to argue that Chevron is subject to many factors that could lower its prices. Chevron\u2019s merger with Hess could just as easily go through, and oil prices could rise, ushering in an era of renewed strength. However, the energy sector faces long-term threats worth considering.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to\u00a0Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nOn January 30, Asian stock markets experienced a decline, with China bearing the brunt of the downturn, amid growing concerns among investors. This pessimism in the market is putting pressure on policymakers in China to consider implementing rate cuts in order to stimulate economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Specifically, stock prices in Hong Kong saw a drop of approximately 2%, while mainland China stocks were on track for a third consecutive day of decline. The recent liquidation order issued against China Evergrande Group on Monday intensified market anxieties, leading to a notable 4% decrease in a Bloomberg index tracking Chinese developers. The Evergrande liquidation saga has cast a shadow over both the Chinese and Hong Kong markets, prompting investors to reassess their positions and adopt a cautious approach. This development underscores the significant influence that regulatory and economic factors in China can have on global financial markets. As market sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty looms, investors are closely monitoring the situation and its potential implications for broader market dynamics. The possibility of rate cuts by Chinese policymakers is being closely watched as investors seek clues about the future direction of economic policy and its impact on market stability.\n\nThe oil market remained stable as investors awaited the United States' response to the recent deadly attack on American troops in Jordan, reported Bloomberg. This attack has the potential to escalate tensions in a region crucial to global crude production. Brent crude futures were trading above $82 per barrel following a 1.4% decline on Monday, despite the drone strike targeting US soldiers. Iran has attempted to distance itself from the attack. Additionally, data indicating that OPEC+ is making a sluggish start to implementing new output cuts contributed to downward pressure on oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also showed little movement amidst the uncertainty. Oil traders are closely monitoring developments, particularly any indications of the US government's response to the attack. There are concerns that any action taken by the US could further heighten tensions in the region, potentially impacting oil supply and prices. As a result, market participants are proceeding cautiously, awaiting clarity on the situation and its potential implications for the oil market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\u00a0among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nOn January 29, Barclays analyst Mario Lu reiterated his Underweight rating on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) while adjusting the price target upwards from $100 to $110. This decision comes amidst ongoing scrutiny and cautious sentiment regarding the company's performance and valuation. Despite the upward revision in the price target, Lu maintains a conservative stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) outlook, suggesting that the stock may not offer significant upside potential in the near term. The decision to maintain the Underweight rating indicates Barclays' skepticism about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) ability to justify its current valuation. The revised price target of $110 suggests that Barclays anticipates limited growth prospects for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), especially considering the prevailing market conditions and the company's financial performance. While the price target raise acknowledges certain positive factors, such as the company's strong brand recognition and market presence, it also underscores the cautious approach taken by analysts like Lu. As of the closing bell on January 29, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock was trading at $152.70, reflecting the market's reaction to the revised price target and Barclays' assessment of the company's valuation.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe largest relative detractors in the quarter were Illumina,\u00a0Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Microsoft. Airbnb continues to deliver double-digit growth in revenue and nights booked, which is especially impressive given the year-ago growth rates it delivered on these same metrics (+29% and +31, respectively). Despite these attractive results, the stock sold off as investors reacted to fourth quarter guidance that came in slightly below expectations. Coming into the fourth quarter, the stock was up +60% on the back of strong fundamentals. Stepping back, nothing has changed. Private rentals continue to take market share from hotels globally, and Airbnb continues to take market share within private rentals given its relentless focus on improving the guest and host experience. Looking ahead, we expect many years of robust earnings and cash flow growth from here.\u201d\n\n09. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Baird analyst William Power increased the price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $186.00 to $200.00, affirming an Outperform rating. This adjustment reflects Baird's optimistic outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) performance and potential within the technology sector. With a revised price target suggesting a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, the analyst's move indicates confidence in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ability to continue delivering value to investors. The decision to maintain the Outperform rating underscores Baird's belief in Apple's strong position in the industry and its ability to outperform market expectations. The raised price target of $200.00 reflects Baird's positive assessment of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth prospects, innovation pipeline, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was trading at $191.73, indicating a modest premium over the revised price target set by Baird.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index\u2019s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. While on a total attribution basis, Apple was not a top three detractor to our full-year return, given its extremely large weighting in the Index, we feel it\u2019s worth sharing our thoughts.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price appreciated nearly 50% in a year when its revenue declined and earnings per share was relatively flat with the previous year.\n\nFor 2024, consensus expectations are for low-single-digit revenue growth and only slightly faster EPS growth. These pedestrian growth rates are not surprising for a company with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue. What is more surprising is that Apple shares trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, a large premium to the market and many faster-growing, competitively advantaged businesses.\n\nWhile we continue to think Apple is a wonderful business, it is also a slow growing one with risks that we do not see as insignificant. Apple\u2019s entire supply chain is based in China and much of its incremental revenue growth also comes from China, so if there is a U.S.-China issue that makes it more difficult for U.S.-based companies that have access to large amounts of local data to operate in China, Apple\u2019s business would likely face more challenges than many others. In addition, much of Apple\u2019s services growth and margin expansion has come from direct payments from Google to be the default search provider on iOS devices. This practice is currently the subject of a lawsuit between Google and the U.S. Justice Department. If this practice is deemed unlawful, it could take away a large and highly profitable revenue stream from Apple\u2019s already slow growth engine. While we closely cover Apple, we continue to believe we have better investment opportunities. Apple\u2019s current P/E is above our Portfolio\u2019s weighted average, yet its long-term earnings growth rate is likely to be lower than even our slowest growing holding, according to our research.\u201d\n\n08. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger increased the price target for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) from $610.00 to $678.00, upholding an Outperform rating. This adjustment underscores Oppenheimer's positive outlook on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) prospects within the software and financial technology industry. With the revised price target indicating a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, Schneeberger's move reflects confidence in Intuit's ability to deliver value to investors. Maintaining the Outperform rating signals Oppenheimer's belief in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) competitive positioning and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $678.00 reflects Oppenheimer's bullish stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) long-term growth prospects, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock was trading at $652.88, indicating a slight premium over the revised price target set by Oppenheimer.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFollowing significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective \u2013 in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.\n\nOur \u2018all-weather\u2019 portfolio centred around our unique definition of \u2018quality\u2019 delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund\u2019s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings,\u00a0Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio\u2019s returns by 0.5% or more.\n\nAs part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.\n\nIntuit held its annual Investor Day during the quarter and the presentation materials are well-worth a review. Intuit is at the forefront of commercial application of artificial intelligence (AI) across its portfolio of businesses \u2013 QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. Intuit has been investing in AI for many years, well before ChatGPT became a buzz word\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n07. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nUpside Potential: 7%\n\nOn January 29, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson increased the price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $153 to $165 while affirming an Overweight rating. This adjustment reflects Keybanc's optimistic outlook on Alphabet's prospects within the technology and internet services industry. With the revised price target suggesting a 7% upside potential compared to the current market price, Patterson's decision underscores confidence in Alphabet's ability to generate value for investors. By maintaining the Overweight rating, Keybanc expresses its conviction in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competitive position and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $165 reflects Keybanc's bullish perspective on Alphabet's long-term growth potential, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It indicates that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. At the closing time on January 29, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock was trading at $153.51, signaling a slight premium over the revised price target set by Keybanc. This adjustment is expected to influence investor sentiment and contribute to ongoing discussions about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) position as a leading player in the technology and internet services market.\n\n06. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nUpside Potential: 9%\n\nOn January 29, Morgan Stanley raised its target price on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares from $39.00 to $48.00, while maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating. This adjustment reflects Morgan Stanley's assessment of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) position within the semiconductor industry and its outlook for the company's future performance. With the revised target price suggesting a 9% upside potential compared to the current market price, Morgan Stanley's decision underscores a moderate level of optimism regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) prospects. By maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating, Morgan Stanley acknowledges Intel's strengths and weaknesses relative to its peers in the industry. This rating suggests that Intel's performance is expected to align with the broader market trends, without significant outperformance or underperformance. The raised target price of $48.00 reflects Morgan Stanley's belief in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to execute its strategic initiatives and drive shareholder value over the long term. It indicates that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting a favorable investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was trading at $43.84, indicating a potential upside from the revised target price set by Morgan Stanley.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) \u2013 New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require \u201cprotection\u201d for Upslope\u2019s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now 11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli Billionaire Mason Hawkins\u2019 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nDividend-paying companies with strong fundamentals and dividend growth history are expected to keep gaining traction as investors come to terms with the reality of the financial markets where volatility and uncertainty is far from over. \u00a0Earlier this month, Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management, said while talking to CNBC that when he looks at job numbers and other economic data he still expects a recession in 2024. Matus said unemployment is rising fast in several states of the US and if someone would \"land on Planet Earth\" and look at the US economy, they would expect the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates instead of cutting them.\n\nThat's why in their 2024 outlook reports several investment firms highlighted the importance of dividend stocks that can weather recession and market turbulence. For example, according to Bloomberg, Franklin Templeton said in its 2024 outlook that dividend-paying companies with strong cash flows become attractive during market volatility but these companies are less prone to face weakness even during down cycles. Financial planning company Nuveen also said that amid valuation issues, it is not extremely positive on large-cap stocks but it is bullish on dividend growers. Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we consulted several credible investing-related websites to see what are the best long-term dividend stocks to buy now according to mainstream financial media, analysts and experts. From our research we selected 13 dividend stocks which are the most popular in the financial media these days. These stocks have decades of consistent dividend growth and strong fundamentals to sustain these dividends. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Why? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nStory continues\n\n13. US Bancorp (NYSE:USB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nWith 14 years of consistent dividend growth, US Bancorp (NYSE:USB)\u00a0is one of the top dividend growth stocks that are popular among analysts and investors.\n\nUS Bancorp (NYSE:USB)\u00a0has a dividend yield of about 4.6%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 29 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in US Bancorp (NYSE:USB). The biggest stakeholder of US Bancorp (NYSE:USB)\u00a0was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $295 million stake in US Bancorp (NYSE:USB).\n\nAristotle Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cHeadquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and with origins dating back to 1863, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a diversified regional bank that operates over 2,400 branches across 26 states, primarily in the Western and Midwestern U.S. As of September 30, 2023, the company had $668 billion in assets, over $518 billion in deposits and more than $375 billion in loans, making it the fifth-largest retail bank in the country.\n\nThe bank offers a variety of services, including retail as well as commercial banking, credit cards, investment management and trust services. At the end of 2022, USB acquired Union Bank from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial (also a Value Equity holding) for approximately $8 billion, adding $82 billion in assets to its balance sheet. This was the bank\u2019s biggest acquisition since 2001 and provides the company with a larger presence on the West Coast, particularly in California\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n12. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the most favorite stocks of billionaires (including Warren Buffett), money managers and analysts. The stock has 61 consecutive years of dividend growth.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US,\u00a0The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nOperating in the ever-green consumer defensive sector, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\u00a0 is one of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy now according to mainstream financial media and analysts.\n\nTsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) ($660.08 \u2013 up 49.0% for the year. Recent high $681.91): Costco operates more than 860 warehouses worldwide and provides its members with a deep value proposition, promising not to charge more than a 15% markup on goods versus its own cost. This in turn has resulted in an extremely loyal membership base of more than 70 million, over $1,900 in net sales per square foot, and high-margin, recurring membership fees. Since 2012, W. Craig Jelinek has been at the helm of Costco and has perpetuated the values and culture of the company\u2019s founder, Jim Sinegal. And while Mr. Jelinek recently stepped down as Chief Executive Officer, we see little change under his successor, Ron Vachris, who has worked at the firm for more than 40 years, having started out as a forklift driver. In many ways, Costco is a cult (I mean that in a positive way), and its allure is only just beginning to spread to international markets, including China. With a stellar management team, strong returns on capital and ample opportunities for growth, domestically and internationally, we believe Costco will continue to compound earnings at a low double-digit rate.\u201d\n\n10. McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) dividend growth streak is about to reach five decades now. As of January 29 the stock had a dividend yield of about 2.29%\n\nCarillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock paused its upwards share price movement after its strong gain in the second quarter. The company\u2019s same-store comparable sales performed better than expected in the second quarter, which relieved investors by suggesting that global consumer\u2019s purchasing strength remains healthy.\u201d\n\n9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 72\n\nWith 36 years of consistent dividend increases, oil giant Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) ranks ninth in our list of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy now according to financial media.\n\nA total of 72 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The biggest stakeholder of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u00a0was Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway which owns an $18 billion stake in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).\n\nEarlier this month, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\u00a0stock was upgraded to Buy from Hold with a price target of $184.\n\nAriel Focus Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlso in the quarter, we initiated a position in\u00a0Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), the second largest integrated energy company in the U.S., operating in exploration, production and refining on a global scale. We view the company as competitively advantaged with a strong balance sheet, sustainable growth pathway and an effective management team. Going forward CVX expects improved cost efficiencies and production growth via its differentiated position in the Permian Basin and recent acquisition of Noble Energy. Additionally, management believes a combination of its new higher-margin projects along with operational improvements will drive a double-digit return of capital employed by 2027. Although oil and gas prices, which lay outside of the company\u2019s control, ultimately dictate Chevron\u2019s earnings and cashflow profile, the organization is laser focused on capital discipline. It is this lack of predictability, and potential fear of a global recession which presented us with an opportunity to initiate a position in this high barrier to entry producer at reasonable prices.\u201d\n\n8. AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 73\n\nWith a 3.7% dividend increase and history of 25+ years of consistent dividend increases, AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) ranks eighth in our list of the best long-term dividend stocks to buy.\n\nIn December, Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral with a $173 price target.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV).\n\nCarillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) reported strong, broad-based second-quarter performance that exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. The company\u2019s raised guidance was a nice recovery after its mildly disappointing first-quarter report.\u201d\n\n7. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 75\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the most popular long-term dividend stocks to buy now. The company has 67 consecutive years of dividend increases under its belt.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, Coca-Cola trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\u00a0The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E, with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate). This equates to a mere 3.3% \u2013 3.7% earnings yield.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n6. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 79\n\nWith four decades of consistent dividend increases and a dominant position in the lucrative oil industry, Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM)\u00a0is one of the best dividend stocks to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM)\u00a0has a dividend yield of about 3.6% as of January 28. Recently, TD Cowen upgraded the stock toOutperform from Market Perform with a price target of $115.\n\nTD Cowen said the stock has a \u201cmore compelling upside as the stock has declined with an unchanged valuation.\u201d\n\n\u201cXOM has been investing in low-cost projects, improving downstream competitiveness, and taking cost out of its business, driving down the oil price needed to organically cover its dividend,\u201d Cowen added.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 79 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM).\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Foreign Stocks To Buy Now Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 15 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "McDonald's (MCD) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when McDonald's (MCD) reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 5, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis world's biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $6.48 billion, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.24% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald's?\n\nFor McDonald's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.38%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that McDonald's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that McDonald's would post earnings of $3 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.19, delivering a surprise of +6.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nMcDonald's appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Brinker International (EAT) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.08 billion, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Brinker International has been revised 3.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.71%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Brinker International will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Few things can stand in McDonald\u2019s way, it seems.\n\nWall Street is expecting more growth ahead of the company\u2019s latest quarterly results on Feb. 5. This comes as tightening wallets, rising costs, and fears around weight loss drugs\u2019 impact hammered fast food stocks last year.\n\nBut business at the Big Mac maker keeps chugging along, as consumers stay hungry for value meals. Its adjusted earnings per share are expected to jump 7% to $2.82, while revenue is expected to grow 9% to $6.5 billion. Even the storm from GLP-1s seems to be passing.\n\nIn December, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski told Yahoo Finance, \"We're seeing no impact today with GLP-1s and ... nobody has any idea what the impact is going to be in the future.\"\n\nAnalysts are optimistic that McDonald's can push through, well, just about anything.\n\nIt's \"hard to see McDonald's not \u2018winning\u2019 in any consumer environment,\u201d Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan wrote in a client note. He projected sustained same-store sales growth in the near term, driven by menu pricing and innovation, loyalty programs, effective marketing, and operational execution and efficiencies.\n\nJefferies\u2019 Andy Barish named the stock a top pick in 2024, calling it the \"best defensive and offensive play in restaurants,\" with \"resiliency in an uncertain or weak macro [environment].\" Barish expects the chain to further invest in digital, delivery, drive-thru and chicken products.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s stock is up 7% in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 20% gain.\n\nAs workers gradually return to the office, the chain also seems to be gaining back breakfast diners. Per Placer.ai, 16.7% of store visits in 2023 were made between 7 a.m and 10 a.m. ET, up from 15.9% in 2022, though it's still lower than 2019 when 18% of visits were made during those hours.\n\nCiti analyst Jon Tower anticipates breakfast challenges for the entire industry, but called McDonald's digital efforts and massive scale a \"core advantage.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"McDonald's has done a phenomenal job of, particularly in the past three years, in ramping this mobile order ahead and loyalty program in the US,\" Tower told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHigher app usage will allow better data collection, enabling McDonald\u2019s to gain more insights into customers and their behaviors, added Towers.\n\nIn Q3, systemwide digital sales \u2014 which includes sales made on the app, delivery, or on the kiosk \u2014 totaled $9 billion across its six biggest markets, making up 40% of total sales. That's a jump from Q2, which saw $8 billion in digital sales.\n\nAnd another growth spurt may be coming, as McDonald's aims to expand from 41,000 to 50,000 restaurants by 2027. This will \"better capture increasing demand McDonald's is seeing worldwide,\u201d said Barish.\n\nEven though there are \"some ongoing broader quick-serve restaurant franchisee profitability concerns,\" Barish expects the issues to abate. Forthcoming interest rate cuts could also help investors \"better appreciate\" the growth plan, he said.\n\nPlus, it may soon have another franchise on its hands \u2014CosMc.\n\nThe drive-thru only concept, which is approximately 2,800 square feet compared to the typical 4,000 to 4,500 square foot restaurant, is intended to solve the 3 PM slump with customizable drinks, alongside sweet and savory treats.\n\nMcDonald's opened its first location in Bolingbrook, Illinois on Dec. 7 with plans to launch nine others in Texas this year.

REUTERS/Eric Cox (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nSo far, the pilot location seems to be showing results.\n\nBased on preliminary data from Placer.ai, CosMc saw \"more than double the number of visits that a typical McDonald\u2019s saw chainwide during December 2023...and more than triple the number of visits per square foot,\" Placer.ai Head of Analytical Research R.J. Hottovy wrote.\n\nHe suspects the numbers would have been \"much higher\" if the concept had additional capacity to \"satisfy the overwhelming demand.\"\n\nIts audience also tends to skew younger, with the largest audience between 18 to 34 years old \u2014 another win for the Golden Arches.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.
