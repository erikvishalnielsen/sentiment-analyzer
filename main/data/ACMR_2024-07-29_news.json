        "title": "ACM Research Enters Fan-out Panel Level Packaging Market with Introduction of Ultra C vac-p Flux Cleaning Tool for Chiplets",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc.\n\nUtilizes vacuum technology and IPA drying to enhance cleaning efficiency enabling cost-effective semiconductor advanced packaging\n\nFREMONT, Calif., July 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACM Research, Inc. (ACM) (NASDAQ: ACMR), a leading supplier of wafer processing solutions for semiconductor and advanced wafer-level packaging applications,\u00a0today announced the Ultra C vac-p flux cleaning tool for fan-out panel-level packaging (FOPLP). Utilizing vacuum technology, the new tool efficiently removes flux residues from chiplet structures. ACM also announced today it received a purchase order from a major China semiconductor manufacturer which has been shipped to the customer\u2019s facility in July.\n\n\u201cThe demand for greater computing power, lower latency and higher bandwidth driven by AI, data centers and autonomous vehicles makes FOPLP an increasingly essential technology.\u201d said Dr. David Wang, ACM\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cFOPLP integrates multiple chips, passive components and interconnections within a single panel-packaged unit, enhancing flexibility, scalability and cost-efficiency. ACM\u2019s Ultra C vac-p represents a major advancement in addressing the cleaning challenges associated with next-generation advanced packaging technologies. This launch not only underscores ACM\u2019s ongoing innovation in semiconductor manufacturing, but also our commitment to address the evolving needs of the industry.\"\n\nAccording to Yole Group1, FOPLP adoption will grow faster than the overall fan-out market, and its market share will move from 2% in 2022 to 8% in 2028. The growth of FOPLP is primarily driven by its potential cost savings. For instance, panels typically utilize more than 95% of the material due to their rectangular or square shape, whereas traditional silicon wafers use less than 85% of the material due to their circular shape. The effective area of a 600x600mm panel is also 5.7 times larger than that of a traditional 300mm silicon wafer, enabling overall cost reductions of approximately 66%. This enhanced area utilization leads to higher throughput, greater AI chip design flexibility, and significant cost savings.\n\nThe Ultra C vac-p tool addresses critical steps in the advanced packaging process, particularly the removal of flux residue before underfilling, which is essential for eliminating voids. Traditional cleaning methods often fail with small bump pitches (less than 40 microns) and large chip sizes due to surface tension and limited liquid penetration. The vacuum technology in ACM\u2019s new tool ensures the cleaning liquid thoroughly reaches all gaps, even in large panel substrates where traditional methods fall short. Combined with ACM\u2019s proprietary IPA drying technology, this comprehensive cleaning process prevents residues that could impair device performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout the Ultra C vac-p Cleaning Tool\n\nThe Ultra C vac-p Cleaning tool is designed for panel substrates and accommodates both organic and glass materials. It is capable of handling panels sized 510 mm x 515 mm and 600 mm x 600 mm, while effectively managing cover warpages up to 7mm.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned -16.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.2% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, to which ACM Research belongs, has lost 13.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.60 points to a change of -1.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.75 indicates a change of +9.4% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ACM Research is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ACMR _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $164.79 million indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. For the current and next fiscal years, $707.51 million and $893.22 million estimates indicate +26.9% and +26.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $152.19 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.9%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.15 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.79%. The EPS surprise was +67.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in ACM Research (ACMR) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR).\n\nACM Research currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by six brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the six recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ACMR Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ACMR\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ACM Research here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying ACM Research, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ACMR a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ACM Research, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $1.60.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ACM Research. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for ACM Research.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It estimates the total available market of its SPM tool to be 25-30% of the total front-end cleaning market.\r\n\r\nStrengthening Electrochemical Plating, Furnace and other technologies on the back of its patented plating technologies, like multi-zone anodes for superior uniformity control, rubber-seal plating chucks for superior sealing, and vacuum pre-wetting of wafers, is a plus.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across evaluation tools, including ACM Research\u2019s Track and Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition platforms, is another positive. \r\n\r\nOn the international front, the solid uptake of ULTRA C v Vacuum Cleaning Tool by major customers to meet the flux removal requirement for chiplets and other advanced 3D packaging structures is contributing well. \r\n\r\nBacked by the robust portfolio strength, ACM Research remains engaged with multiple customers in both international and domestic markets, which, in turn, is expected to deliver substantial revenue growth this year, and in 2025 and beyond. \r\n\r\nACMR\u2019s customer base includes the likes of Shanghai Huali Microelectronics, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, SK Hynix, Yangtze Memory Technologies, ChangXin Memory Technologies, Nantong Tongfu Microelectronics and Wafer Works Corporation.\n\nStory continues\n\nEstimates at a Glance\n\nACM Research\u2019s compelling product portfolio, strong position in the semiconductor industry and growing clientele are expected to drive its top-line growth in the long run.\r\n\r\nIts long-term target of more than $1 billion in revenues is noteworthy. \r\n\r\nThe company also expects 2024 revenues between $650 million and $725 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $707.51 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.9%.\n\nACMR's Strong Outlook ACMR\n\nImage Source: ACMR\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.60 per share, which has been unchanged over the past 30 days.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough ACM Research\u2019s long-term prospects are bright, its near-term prospects remain foggy due to high inflation and tightening U.S.-China trade policies.\r\n\r\nThis is reflected by the company\u2019s Value Style Score of C, which suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nHence, investors should wait for a better entry point for ACM Research, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Should You Be Adding ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nView our latest analysis for ACM Research\n\nHow Quickly Is ACM Research Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that ACM Research has grown EPS by 51% per year, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note ACM Research achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 51% to US$636m. That's progress.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\n\nAre ACM Research Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nIt should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. So it is good to see that ACM Research insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$184m. This totals to 12% of shares in the company. Enough to lead management's decision making process down a path that brings the most benefit to shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes ACM Research Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nACM Research's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, ACM Research is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

        "title": "The 3 Most Promising Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "In tech investments, semiconductor stocks remain a cornerstone of growth and innovation. As the market delves into July 2024, identifying the top performers in this sector becomes crucial to having stable returns and strategic growth opportunities.\n\nOngoing tech advancements like AI and the related pulse of global economic trends magnify semiconductor stocks\u2019 valuation. The first company stands out with its aggressive node completion strategy and groundbreaking product releases, reinforcing its market dominance. The second one, navigating through a nuanced demand environment, showcases resilience with meticulous inventory management and robust financial metrics.\n\nMeanwhile, the third company has an edge in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It holds substantial revenue growth and strategic investments. Learning about these companies\u2019 strategic maneuvers and fundamental progress can help them capitalize on the semiconductor industry\u2019s growth trajectory. Here, the focus is on each company\u2019s technological innovations, market strategies and financial fundamentals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) leads semiconductor manufacturing by designing and producing microprocessors. The company focuses on completing the five nodes in four years. This goal demonstrates the company\u2019s rapid technological advancement. Intel has the fundamental ability to innovate and regain process leadership. The production ramp of Intel 20A and the anticipated production ramp of Intel 18A in H1 2025 highlight significant market leads. The introduction of high-NA EUV technology with Intel 14A further solidifies Intel\u2019s tech leadership.\n\nMoreover, product releases such as Arrow Lake, Meteor Lake and Panther Lake, along with the lead products Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake, emphasize a robust product roadmap. Intel\u2019s capability to double AI PC CPU units sequentially in Q2 2024 and exceed the\u00a0original 40 million\u00a0AI PC CPU target for the year indicates strong market demand and execution capability. Intel Foundry Services (IFS) generated $4.4 billion in revenue in Q1 2024, focusing on establishing a foundry relationship between Intel Products and Intel Foundry. This new operating model aims to optimize cost structures and improve profitability.\n\nOverall, Intel\u2019s strategic focus on next-generation nodes and AI-driven processors positions it among the top semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) prevails in high-performance mixed-signal semiconductor solutions. The company may benefit in Q2 2024 with industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) market growth of a high single-digit percent range annually and sequentially. It is driven by improving demand in China. Meanwhile, the mobile market is expected to be in the low 20% range annually and about flat sequentially, indicating a modest cyclical recovery.\n\nMoreover, NXP plans to stage slightly higher inventory in the channel during Q2 2024 to support competitiveness for anticipated second-half growth. The guidance assumes approximately 1.7 months of distribution channel inventory exiting Q2. NXP\u2019s Q1 2024 financial performance was solid. The revenue aligns with guidance, with a\u00a0gross margin of 58.2% and a solid operating margin of 34.5%. The company\u2019s sharp cost management and operational edge contributed to these positive results. Indeed, NXP remains focused on its long-term financial model, maintaining gross margins at or above the high end of the range and managing internal fab utilization levels\u00a0in the low 70s. As a result, the company\u2019s disciplined approach to cost management and strategic investments may yield prolonged profitability and growth.\n\nTo sum up, NXP\u2019s strong presence in high-growth markets and disciplined financial performance make it a standout among semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) edges on advanced wafer processing solutions and equipment for semiconductor manufacturers. The company\u2019s financial health points to its strong cash position. ACM Research ended the quarter with over $288 million in cash. Indeed, this robust cash reserve gives the company the financial flexibility to invest in new tech processes, expand production capabilities and counter-economic uncertainties. ACM Research hit first-quarter shipments of $245 million, a 175% annual increase. Specifically, this surge in shipments indicates solid, increasing client demand. With that, the company has scalability and supply chain efficiency.\n\nFurther, the revenue from ACM\u2019s single wafer cleaning, Tahoe, and semi-critical cleaning products grew by 199% in Q1, representing\u00a072% of the total revenue. The company\u2019s comprehensive cleaning portfolio, which supports nearly\u00a090% of all cleaning processes in SAPS\u00a0for memory and logic devices, positions it as a leader in this market segment. Moreover, introducing advanced products such as the high-temperature single-wafer SPM tools and the ULTRA C v Vacuum Cleaning Tool further enhances its competitive edge.\n\nTo conclude, ACM Research\u2019s lead in critical semiconductor manufacturing equipment makes it a top mark among semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in INTC and ACMR.

        "title": "7 Oversold Tech Stocks Primed to Quintuple by 2025",
        "content": "Software and tech stocks, especially those in the sizzling AI and social media fields, have been the stars of the show. However, these high-flyers are just a sliver of the oversold tech stocks trading on the market today.\n\nThere\u2019s a treasure trove of oversold tech stocks still waiting to be discovered. These hidden gems could be primed for a major comeback as interest rate cuts kick in and the economy shifts into a new cycle. Sure, betting on recovery plays is always a bit of a gamble. That said, the potential upside often justifies the downside risk of these already-depressed stocks.\n\nHere are seven oversold tech stocks to consider looking into:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnapchat (NYSE:SNAP) doesn\u2019t really need an introduction. However, if you\u2019re new to the social media world, Snapchat is basically a visual messaging app. The stock has experienced significant volatility over the past year, trading in a depressed range despite being up 20% as of writing. I believe there is huge upside potential for SNAP going forward.\n\nSnapchat reported revenue of $1.19 billion in Q1 2024, a 21% increase year-over-year. The company also saw its daily active users grow 10% to 422 million. Despite this growth, Snapchat\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) has remained stagnant. I see significant room for improvement in this metric, which could drive the oversold tech stock higher. Earnings per share is also expected to recover massively in the coming quarters.\n\nAnother major potential tailwind for Snapchat is the possibility of TikTok getting banned in the U.S., Given the significant user overlap between the two apps. I believe Snapchat would be a prime beneficiary if TikTok refugees need a new platform. This could provide a substantial boost to Snapchat.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a digital payment platform that enables online money transfers for consumers and merchants worldwide. The stock has remained depressed for an extended period, largely due to high interest rates suppressing transaction volumes and a slowdown in user growth following the COVID-19 boom. However, I believe there are compelling reasons for optimism about PayPal\u2019s future prospects.\n\nPayPal\u2019s core financials remain robust. The company made $5 billion in buybacks last year and is doing it again this year. Revenue growth also came in at 9.4%, which is not that bad compared to its historical top-line growth. The financials suggest the stock should\u2019ve recovered back to its pre-pandemic levels at least a year ago. That hasn\u2019t been the case due to user account growth in the negatives and cash flow taking a hit from buybacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, user account growth has turned positive again, well, sequentially. However, this could imply an inflection point.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) develops and sells semiconductor process equipment for wet cleaning, electroplating and other processes. I\u2019m bullish on this U.S. based company as it\u2019s well-positioned to benefit from the AI and data boom, along with the billions in tax breaks and subsidies being poured into the semiconductor industry.\n\nACM Research has been one of the fastest-growing players in the space, reporting a 105% year-over-year revenue surge to $152.2 million in Q1 2024. The company\u2019s gross margin remained strong at 52.5%, and it\u2019s making strategic expansions in the U.S., Korea and Europe. Analysts have a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus on the stock, with an average price target of $37.91, representing a 54.8% upside.\n\nAs long as the demand for advanced chips continues, driven by megatrends like generative AI, I believe ACM Research has the ingredients to keep compounding. The company is well-positioned to capture a piece of the over $70 billion in federal subsidies being sought by chipmakers. While there are risks, the overall semiconductor industry outlook for 2024 looks promising, with sales expected to rebound by 13% to $588 billion. I think ACM Research is a compelling play on these tailwinds.\n\nInnovid (CTV) A remote being held and pointed at a black flatscreen tv with two potted plants on either side\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Gaurav Paswan\n\nInnovid (NYSE:CTV) is an independent software platform for creating, delivering, measuring and optimizing advertising across connected TV, linear TV and digital. I believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from the megatrends of increasing ad spending and a renewed focus on growth by Wall Street. Companies are bumping up their ad budgets again, and Innovid\u2019s innovative solutions in the fast-growing connected TV space make it an attractive option for advertisers looking to maximize their return on investment.\n\nDespite a recent decline, Innovid\u2019s stock is still up an impressive 44% over the past year. The company exceeded revenue expectations in Q1 2024, reporting $36.7 million in revenue, a solid 21% year-over-year increase. This beat analyst estimates by a healthy 5.12%.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts anticipate Innovid will turn a profit next year, with earnings expected to double the year after.\n\nAt the current price, the stock trades at around 16x earnings. While not a screaming bargain, I believe there\u2019s potential for Innovid\u2019s EPS to compound at an even higher rate, given the company\u2019s strong position in the burgeoning connected TV advertising market.\n\nInnovid\u2019s Harmony initiative, launched in Q1 2024, aims to optimize the connected TV advertising ecosystem and could be a significant growth driver.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) An image of a hand holding a phone with a cloud on the screen, icons above the phone; controller, music note, camera, plane, shopping cart, home, magnifying glass. Cloud computing stocks to buy\n\nSource: La1n/Shutterstock\n\nGigaCloud Technology (NYSE:GCT) operates a B2B e-commerce marketplace connecting suppliers and resellers of large merchandise. You might initially assume it\u2019s a cloud computing company based on the name, but that\u2019s not the case. GigaCloud has been growing revenue at a blistering pace, nearly doubling year-over-year to $251 million in Q1 2024. Net income also surged 71% to $27 million. The company is riding megatrends like the rise of B2B marketplaces and e-commerce.\n\nI believe GigaCloud has a long growth runway ahead. It\u2019s attractively valued at just 10 times forward earnings despite the strong growth. The stock has already soared 270% over the past year but has consolidated recently. With interest rate cuts potentially on the horizon, I think GCT stock could be poised for another leg higher.\n\nWall Street is bullish on the company. In the latest quarter, GigaCloud handily beat analyst estimates with EPS of 66 cents and revenue of $251 million. The company also provided strong Q2 guidance of $265-280 million in revenue. Analysts see several tailwinds that could boost GigaCloud, like its expansion into branding services, growth of its third-party seller network, and synergies from its Noble House and Wondersign acquisitions.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still a relatively under-the-radar name, I believe GigaCloud one of the promising oversold tech stocks that deserves more attention. The company has delivered five straight quarters of revenue growth amid a tough environment for consumer spending. As it further optimizes its marketplace and pursues international expansion, I expect GigaCloud to keep putting up impressive numbers.\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUdemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) is an online learning platform that offers courses on a wide range of topics. With the job market becoming increasingly competitive due to the rise of AI, many people are scrambling to learn new skills to stay relevant. I believe Udemy is well-positioned to benefit from this trend, especially in developing countries where access to quality education can be limited.\n\nThe company reported strong Q1 2024 results, with total revenue growing 12% year-over-year to $197 million. Udemy Business, which serves enterprise customers, saw a particularly impressive growth of 24%. Annual recurring revenue also increased 21% to $479 million.\n\nDespite the positive financials, Udemy\u2019s stock has been on a downward trajectory, declining over 38% in the last six months. However, analysts expect earnings per share to jump from 8 cents to 54 cents over the next two years, which could drive the stock higher in the long run. Udemy also has a solid cash buffer.\n\nBM Technologies (BMTX) Online banking. Person using online banking platform on phone\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nBM Technologies (NYSEMKT:BMTX) provides digital banking services through its cloud-based platform. I believe the rise of digital banking is an unstoppable megatrend, and BM Technologies is well-positioned to ride this wave. The company\u2019s first quarter 2024 results showed significant improvement, with revenue of $16.2 million and net income turning positive to $700 thousand. This suggests the turnaround efforts are starting to pay off.\n\nBM Technologies\u2019 stock has been beaten down but looks to have bottomed out recently. Analysts have a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus on the stock, with an average price target of $6.75. That implies a significant upside from the current price of around $2.9. I think once interest rates start getting cut, digital banking platforms like BM Technologies could see a major breakout among oversold tech stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, which ACM Research falls in, has lost 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share, indicating a change of -37.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.75 indicates a change of +9.4% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ACM Research is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ACMR _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate of $164.79 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $707.51 million and $893.22 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +26.9% and +26.3%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $152.19 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.9%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.15 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.79%. The EPS surprise was +67.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Small-Cap Stocks Set to Make Early Investors Filthy Rich",
        "content": "Investing in small-cap growth stocks can be an exhilarating experience. These companies, typically with a market capitalization under $2 billion, often represent disruptive innovators or niche players in high-growth industries.\n\nIdentifying these hidden gems before they become household names is key to turning a modest investment into a fortune. This potential for explosive growth undoubtedly comes at a higher risk, as these companies may be unprofitable or be up against significant competition. However, for those willing to accept the risk, the rewards can be substantial for early investors.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on these opportunities, it\u2019s crucial to conduct thorough research and due diligence. Additionally, you should aim to have a diversified portfolio and never risk more than you can afford to potentially lose.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are the top three small-cap growth stocks to buy in 2024!\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) takes the cake among the top small-cap growth stocks to buy. As demand for advanced semiconductor chips remains high in 2024, ACM Research is well-positioned to capitalize on this wave.\n\nThe company is a leading wafer packaging and semiconductor cleaning company. Its technology primarily focuses on enhancing the performance and reliability of semiconductor wafers. The company\u2019s proprietary Space Alternated Phase Shift (SAPS) technology uses advanced megasonic waves to effectively clean semiconductor wafers. Adoption for its semiconductor packaging services continues to accelerate, boosting its top and bottom line growth.\n\nIn FY23, the company saw record revenue of $558 million, with earnings per share nearly doubling to $1.16 per share. Moreover, the ongoing recovery in the wafer fabrication market is a positive sign to build on momentum. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue skyrocketed 105% year-over-year (YOY) to $152.2 million. Additionally, earnings per share ballooned 136% YOY to 26 cents per share. With strong revenue guidance, a broadening product portfolio, and record shipments in Q1, ACMR stock could deliver outsized returns through 2030.\n\nPayoneer (PAYO) Payoneer editorial. Illustrative photo for news about Payoneer - an American financial services company.\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayoneer (NASDAQ:PAYO), a global payments platform, has emerged as an indefensible player in the fintech space. With a market capitalization of approximately $2 billion, Payoneer\u2019s growing revenue and earnings make it an attractive option for risk-tolerant investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s true strength lies in its expertise in facilitating cross-border transactions for small and medium-sized businesses. With the global economy going digital, the need for different payment options is paramount. Its platform addresses these needs by offering a range of services, including multi-currency accounts, working capital and payment processing. Furthermore, the company\u2019s growing earnings, gross margins and cash flows are positive signs for the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter achieving its first full year of GAAP profitability in FY23, Payoneer\u2019s earnings continue to accelerate. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 19% YOY to $228.2 million. Additionally, net earnings catapulted 265% YOY, with B2B payment volume up 33% from the year prior. The stock is still down significantly from its IPO despite the company\u2019s clear progress. That places PAYO stock among the best small-cap growth stocks to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nFortuna Mining (FSM) gold and silver bricks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFortuna Mining (NYSE:FSM) is a prominent player in the mining sector, focused on the exploration and production of precious metals like silver and gold. With investors concerned about de-dollarization, inflation and global debt, Fortuna is a leading candidate among small-cap growth stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nThe company, formerly Fortuna Silver Mines, is gaining investor appeal in 2024 as gold and silver prices rise rapidly. Founded nearly two decades ago, the company enjoys a diversified portfolio of mining assets. That includes mines in Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. Over the last year, Fortuna has expanded its production capacity and explored new mining opportunities.\n\nOne example is its recent findings just last month of high-grade gold deposits at its Seguela mine in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Moreover, it reduced its leverage by paying down long-term debt to strengthen its liquidity. These are all positive backdrops as the company is positioned to drive profitable growth from higher gold and silver prices in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is ACM Research (ACMR) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR).\n\nACM Research currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by six brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the six recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ACMR Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ACMR\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ACM Research here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ACM Research, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ACMR a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ACM Research, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $1.60.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ACM Research.

        "content": "Global share prices are seeing unprecedented gains. The rally appears to be extending beyond the big names, putting the spotlight on high-growth small-caps.\n\nMuch of the gains in the first half of the year have been powered by mega-cap stocks- and with good reason. Tech juggernauts like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are experiencing massive growth- pushing its share price to new highs.\n\nHowever, with much of the wealth concentrated among a small group of big names, it can be easy to overlook the potential of smaller stocks. These perpetual under-dogs aka small-caps have a market cap ranging from $250 million to $3 billion. They offer high growth potential but with the added risk of volatility.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs the broader markets rise, several small-cap stocks are seeing massive gains. Some have even seen a 100% revenue growth in the past year- making them attractive opportunities for investors willing to take on more risk for higher returns. Moreover, small-caps can help balance out portfolios because they tend to perform well in bear markets.\n\nSmall-Caps with Growth Potential: ACM Research (ACM) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne stock that\u2019s high on investor\u2019s radar is ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR). The company caters to today\u2019s chip-centric era with the product required to clean silicon wafers during production. This is a crucial element required by semiconductor manufacturers to remove the contaminants in their circuits.\n\nAs the chip wars heat up, ACM Research\u2019s offering is more relevant than ever enabling the company to generate a robust deal pipeline and expand in markets beyond China. This growth was evident in its recent earnings where revenue was up a whopping 105% from last year. Net income followed a similar trajectory, coming in at $17.43 million, up from $7.14 in the prior year. In terms of guidance, ACMR expects revenue to fall in the $650 million to $725 million range.\n\nWhile the results paint an optimistic picture, one potential headwind is the rising geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. This could hinder chip sales in the region. Nevertheless, ACMR\u2019s long-term potential remains robust. This is underscored by a massive uptick in shipments (up 175% in Q1) and strong revenue growth.\n\nAlarum Technologies Ltd (ALAR) internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecurity\n\nSource: Song_about_summer / Shutterstock\n\nAlarum Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:ALAR) is in the business of internet access and web data acquisitions. The company\u2019s competitive edge lies in its NetNut suite of solutions that uses a hybrid proxy network to provide robust security measures. This software ensures users have privacy, protection and speed when browsing on private servers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince its inception, the company has introduced a series of new product offerings. Among these is the search engine results page (SERP) scraper API which automates the retrieval and analysis of search engine data for better SEO. More recently, ALAR announced an AI data collection tool that would use a no-code interface to streamline data collection.\n\nComing to the financials, which are just as impressive as its products. In its first quarter, revenue was up by 139% at $8.1 million. Alarum also recorded a net profit of $1.4 million- marking a strong improvement from a net loss in the prior year. Looking ahead, the company hopes to keep the momentum going with several product launches this year.\n\nHigh-growth small-caps like ALAR are a good buy for investors willing to bank on its massive potential.\n\nEnovix (ENVX) a lithium ion battery. Lithium Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal/ShutterStock.com\n\nEnovix (NASDAQ:ENVX) is redefining the battery industry with the development of silicon-anode-lithium-ion batteries. That\u2019s a mouthful but put in simple terms, it\u2019s disrupting the battery technology space. The company prides itself on the diverse utility of its lithium batteries which can be used in almost anything from military equipment to cameras and PCs.\n\nThis promising potential fueled bullish sentiments amongst industry experts. As per analyst estimates, ENVX stock price is projected to double to $30.3.

        "content": "Uncovering cheap stocks amid the noise of overvalued and overhyped stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is essential in today\u2019s volatile stock market. Three undervalued AI stocks are set up for significant growth in this case. With innovation, profitability, and astute market positioning, each business offers investors a distinctive opportunity inside the semiconductor and technology industries. Starting with the first one, well-known for producing cutting-edge processors that power consumer electronics and data centers, one can understand why the stocks stand out. The next, known for its expertise in data analytics, keeps surprising with its growing commercial presence and profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, the last company on the list is causing a stir with its revenue growth in semiconductor manufacturing solutions. With that, there are improvements in operational efficiency. Investigating these three businesses is crucial for investors hoping to profit from equities with solid fundamentals and room to develop. Every company strongly argues for being included in a diverse portfolio aimed at long-term growth. In short, they have supremacy in processor technology, solid business strategy in data analytics, or calculated expansion in the semiconductor markets.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) leads the design and manufacturing of semiconductor and AI products. Indeed, the company\u2019s client business has driven solid growth. This\u00a0is because of the high demand and decisive performance of AMD\u2019s Ryzen 8000 series CPUs. For Q1 2024, the division had sales of $1.4 billion, signifying an 85% year-over-year (YOY) growth. The strong sales of Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs led to this growth. There is a solid growth potency, as these chips are embedded in devices from major original equipment manufacturers like HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, AMD\u2019s sharp boost in the client market\u00a0is mainly based\u00a0on how its product line incorporates AI capabilities. This strategic integration aligns with the expected expansion of AI in the PC industry. AMD believes that this signals a major turning point. AMD may thrive and expand in the AI PC market because of its partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and more than 150 independent software vendors (ISVs) to create AI apps for Ryzen CPUs.\n\nOverall, AMD is on the undervalued AI stocks list due to its strong market position in the client segment and vital strategic partnerships.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) provides data integration and analytics software solutions for government agencies and commercial enterprises. The company\u2019s top line was $634 million in Q1 2024, representing a 21% YOY gain. Strong momentum in its government and commercial areas propelled this expansion. In Q12024, Palantir\u2019s adjusted operating margin increased to 36%, demonstrating the robust unit economics of its business strategy. This margin improvement and sales growth helped the company achieve a Rule of 40 score of 57%. This\u00a0indicates a solid balance between profitability and revenue growth.\n\nMoreover, Palantir\u2019s US commercial business had a solid growth rate. In Q1 2024, revenue from the US commercial division increased by 40% YOY to\u00a0$150 million. Several factors helped to fuel this expansion. These are significant increases in the number of customers (69% YOY) and Total Contract Value (TCV), with $286 million booked in Q1 (a 131% YOY gain). The company can grow its current clientele and draw in new ones. This\u00a0demonstrates the versatility and potency of its offerings, such as the AI Platform (AIP).\n\nTo sum up, Palantir is on the undervalued AI stock list for its constant profitability and expanding customer base.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) provides equipment and services for semiconductor manufacturers. To begin with, in Q1 2024, the company\u2019s top line from single wafer cleaning increased to $109.5 million. There has been a massive 199% gain against Q1 2023. With that, ACM\u2019s operating margin increased to 26.2% from 14.7% in Q1 2023. This enhancement\u00a0is based\u00a0on operational leverage, economies of scale, and efficient cost management over operations. As a proportion of sales, total operating expenditures dropped from 41.9% to 35.4%, indicating increased operational efficiency.\n\nFurther, ACM has\u00a0a CapEx\u00a0of $25.4 million for Q1 and an estimated\u00a0$100 million for 2024. This\u00a0demonstrates the company\u2019s focus on growing its facilities, especially in Lingang, Shanghai. The company is also improving its operating capacities in\u00a0important\u00a0markets such as the US and Korea. ACM\u2019s expanding worldwide footprint\u00a0is reflected in its strong acceptance and favorable feedback from foreign markets, including the US, Europe, and Asia, and its\u00a0important\u00a0ties with major semiconductor manufacturers in China, Korea, and other countries.\n\nFinally, ACM Research was included in the undervalued AI stocks list due to its rapid revenue growth and strategic\u00a0expansion\u00a0in\u00a0key\u00a0global markets.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, PLTR and ACMR.

        "content": "It hasn't been the best quarter for ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 22% in that time. But over five years returns have been remarkably great. In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 326%. Impressive! So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for ACM Research investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ACM Research\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, ACM Research managed to grow its earnings per share at 43% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that ACM Research has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this freeinteractive graphic.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that ACM Research shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 72% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 34% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand ACM Research better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - ACM Research has  2 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of companies we expect will grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Finding cheap growth stocks in today\u2019s changing market offers investors looking for significant returns a strong chance. The main emphasis is the strategic examination of three businesses that exemplify this potential. These companies are frequently disregarded but have\u00a0solid\u00a0fundamentals and encouraging growth paths. One of these businesses sticks out due to its exceptional top-line growth and strong position in crucial semiconductor processing solutions. Meanwhile, another company on the list is keeping up with the rapidly growing 5G market by achieving steady revenue growth, holding onto a healthy financial position, and setting itself up for strategic development.\n\nOn the other hand, the last company on the list is notable for its inventiveness in biometric authentication technology, which supports its income streams and highlights its ability to withstand cybersecurity attacks.

ACM outperformed its projected\u00a0range of 40% to 45% with a gross margin of 52.5% against industry volatility.\u00a0This\u00a0suggests the company is managing costs well and may have more pricing power for its specialized product offerings. Further, an operating margin of 26.2%, a solid rise over the prior year\u2019s 14.7%, and an operating income of $39.8 million demonstrate operational efficiency. This enhancement proves that ACM can scale its operations with revenue growth.\n\nOverall, fundamentals like rapid top-line growth and gross margin expansion solidify ACM Research\u2019s presence on the undervalued growth stocks list.\n\nStory continues\n\nRadcom (RDCM) Image of a nighttime cityscape with a hyper-connected sky and \"5G\" in white letters in the center\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRadcom (NASDAQ:RDCM) provides solutions for 5G and cloud assurance.

        "title": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR): Is This Semiconductor Stock a Good Buy?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Small Publicly Traded Semiconductor Companies To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) stands against the other small publicly traded semiconductor stocks.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has become one of the most important in the world, akin to the key role that oil plays in the global economy. While making this argument would have been tricky in 2022, 2023 and the onset of the artificial intelligence boom makes it much easier to say so. This is because chip companies sit right at the heart of the AI revolution due to their ability to transform literal sand on a beach into pieces of silicon that aim to meet or surpass human intelligence.\n\nThis criticality of semiconductors to the global economy and AI has translated into share price performance as well. Wall Street, always eager to catch the next big trend before it occurs, has piled into semiconductor stocks with no end in sight. Some of the biggest semiconductor firms in the world are up by 211% over the past twelve months, and their share price performance is matched by equally impressive revenue growth which would have been thought to be impossible just a couple of years back.\n\nSemiconductor stock indexes which are made of the most consequential chip firms in the world have also gained value. Semiconductor stock indexes, maintained by the S&P and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange are up 17.26% and 57.94% respectively over the past twelve months. This burst of performance comes after a disastrous 2022 that saw big and small semiconductor stocks tumble in the wake of a historic demand and supply mismatch following the coronavirus pandemic. The semiconductor sector is highly cyclical, and between the start of 2022 and the market bottom in October, the S&P's semiconductor stock index had lost 42% while Philly's index was down by 43%.\n\nWhen it comes to valuing semiconductor stocks, some investors prefer to use the price to earnings growth (PEG) ratio instead of the more popular price to earnings (P/E) ratio. The PEG ratio also accounts for earnings growth, and when we look at some fast growing semiconductor stocks with vastly different market capitalization and revenue base, the ratio hovers around 1.45 to 1.48 for both of them. This ratio can inform investors about the future trend of a firm's stock based on its historic EPS growth to see whether there is an earnings growth trend that can be exploited.\n\nAs for investing in semiconductor stocks, some research shows that it might be worth it. One such paper comes from researchers in China who used a benchmark portfolio of US listed semiconductor stocks on the NASDAQ and NYSE with an enterprise value greater than $50 billion and generated a forecast portfolio using the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) model to check whether future cash flows merit a current investment. Their study revealed that not only was the benchmark portfolio undervalued by 30.56%, but it had an even higher undervaluation of 37.29% when the P/E ratio was analyzed. Of course, the cutoff date for the research was April 2023, so some of the growth predicted in this model has already materialized by now.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the top small publicly traded semiconductor companies, it's also important to see what experts think about the future direction of the industry. Research from Gartner shows that global semiconductor revenue will grow by 17% in 2024 to sit at $628 billion, with the growth fueled by a whopping 66% growth in the memory industry. The product end of the semiconductor industry is broadly bifurcated into application processors (such as CPUs and GPUs) and memory products (such as RAM), and often, different firms dominate either area. The 17% Gartner growth estimate is matched by a 16% growth estimate from the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). McKinsey estimates that global semiconductor sales will reach $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nCurrently around two thirds of global semiconductor sales take place in Asia. About 75% of global wafer fabrication capacity is in 4 Asian countries: Taiwan, South Korea, China, and Japan. In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, providing $39 billion in incentives over 5 years to bolster semiconductor manufacturing in the US. Overall, the semiconductor industry is very active both on the demand side and the supply side. There are some signs that this industry might be in bubble territory. According to Aswath Damodaran, semiconductor industry contains 63 firms and these firms have an average EV/EBITDA ratio of 31.6. This is the highest EV/EBITDA multiple among all industries tracked by Damodaran (only positive EBITDA firms are considered for these calculations).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some small publicly traded semiconductor companies. As compared to the giants, there might be greater growth runways to these firms, allowing the prescient investor to capitalize early on.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top small publicly traded semiconductor companies, we ranked semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks with a market cap lower than $2 billion by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nClose-up of a worker wearing protective gear inspecting a silicon wafer in a laboratory.\n\nACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 18\n\nACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a mid sized specialized semiconductor equipment provider that deals with products that enable chip manufacturers to control quality and yield by cleaning the silicon wafers during fabrication. Its business model means that ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) benefits when there is a growth in global chip manufacturing. Right now, not only has the US government announced $280 billion in funding to develop semiconductors in America, but European, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese governments have also either launched or might launch similar initiatives. The de globalization of semiconductor supply chains is a hot topic in the industry right now, and ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) stands to benefit particularly when it expands its presence globally. Another key to its success is maintaining customer relationships, cost advantages, and technological competence to ensure that current or potential competitors do not snatch market share.\n\nHowever, ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) might be harmed if trade tensions between the US and China restrict US chip company sales in the country. During its Q1 2024 earnings call, management shared a lot of details about ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR)'s international initiatives when it shared:\n\nOur growth is also being driven by new entrants. On the international front, we plan to deliver ULTRA C v backside cleaning and a bevel etcher tool in the second quarter of 2024 to a large US manufacturer that qualify as the first SAP cleaning tool for revenue last year. This demonstrates a deepening relationship which we believe can lead to production orders across multiple product lines. Moreover, ACM brand and the reputation are gaining recognition among other US chip makers with new engagement and the potential opportunity to penetrate their global manufacturer sites. We recently hired additional seasonal marketing and sales professionals who bring establishing their relationship with key US semiconductor players.\n\nIn Europe, we install our first ever evaluation tool, the ULTRA C SAPS V cleaning tool at a major global semiconductor manufacturer in the fourth quarter last year. The initial feedback has been positive and we are optimistic that the volume production order possible by middle of the year. We think Korea we see opportunity with SK Hynix, high bandwidth memory HDM product. We see potential gains with our SAPS cleaning tool for high aspirational vehicles as well as ultra ECP for TSV applications. To support growth, we made a progress in our facility expending in China and other regions. Please turn to Slide 8. In China, construction of our Lingang production R&D center is nearly complete. We expect the production later this year. In Korea, we are making progress with key customers, we believe a strong commitment to Korea can improve our relationship with key Korean customers.\n\nOur resource in Korea can also provide another basis to supporting international customer in the US, Europe and other parts of Asia. We recently hired a new leader to run our Korea operations, David Kim. He is a long-time veteran of SK Hynix, we are optimistic his experience and relationship will help adoption our technology and accelerate our business in the region. We continue to invest in our Oregon site to add to our service, support and demonstration capability for R&D and customer activity in the US and Europe. I would now provide our outlook. Please turn to Slide 9. We believe WFE spending in China will remain solid as the country continues on its goal to match its production capacity with the end-market consumption. We are focused on gaining market share in China, new product introduction and expanding our business to new customers in the USA, Korea, Europe and other Asia markets.\n\nOverall ACMR ranks 9th on our list of the best small publicly traded semiconductor stocks to buy.

        "content": "Tech stocks have long been the darlings of the investment world.\n\nBut recent shifts in market dynamics have brought several to trade at what can only be described as deep discounts. Despite the sector\u2019s dazzling rally in 2023, driven by groundbreaking advances in technologies like generative artificial intelligence (AI), some tech stocks still remain undervalued. These anomalies present a unique opportunity for discerning investors ready to capitalize on prices that might not stay low for long.\n\nAs we navigate through 2024, several factors hint at a continued upward trajectory for the tech industry. Innovations in AI, ongoing digital transformation across industries and an easing of the aggressive rate hikes that previously dampened market enthusiasm all contribute to a fertile ground for growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors looking for potential high-return investments should consider tech stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value. Yet, such stocks are not likely to remain at these levels. More investors recognize their potential and act to correct the market\u2019s short-term oversights.

According to FactSet Earnings Insights, analysts expect 16.1% year-over-year (YOY) growth for the overall sector.\n\nOn that note, several additional catalysts will drive earnings higher for the following tech stocks to buy now. Firstly, we are in the midst of an AI revolution and companies are investing heavily in the technology. As a result, these companies are profiting as demand grows for their AI infrastructure, products and services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSecondly, spending is accelerating, especially in critical areas like chip manufacturing, digitization, cloud computing and digital advertising. Most enterprises are past the cost optimization phase. This means reaccelerating IT spending will boost revenues and profits for the following companies.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the AI era, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) should be one of the first tech stocks to buy now, given its leadership in the space. A game-changing partnership with OpenAI and massive investments in AI infrastructure has positioned it for success.\n\nMicrosoft is leading the way in AI infrastructure. Due to its strategic partnership with OpenAI, it offers the best frontier and open-source models. By the end of Q3 fiscal year 2024, over 65% of Fortune 500 companies were using its Azure OpenAI Service. Furthermore, its Models as a Service offering enables developers to use small language models (SLMs) and large language models (LLMs) without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.\n\nThe software giant has also infused AI into its applications, ranging from GitHub to Microsoft 365. Its range of Copilots is bending the productivity curve, resulting in significant revenue acceleration. For instance, developers using GitHub Copilot see improved code quality and higher productivity. As a result, GitHub now has 1.8 million subscribers, and growth accelerated by 35% quarter-over-quarter in Q3 FY2024.\n\nWith these AI tailwinds, Microsoft remains one of the top tech stocks to buy now. Analysts have 47 buy and no sell ratings, highlighting the consensus bullish view. Undoubtedly, the software giant is a leader in AI and will continue to thrive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAppLovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) provides a platform that enables developers to monetize and market their mobile applications through its proprietary targeting engine. This company is a critical cog in monetizing the free-to-play gaming ecosystem. In the past, it has had tremendous success utilizing contextual data for ad matching. With AI, the addressable market and growth opportunities have expanded significantly.\n\nWith AI, AppLovin is improving its targeting, enabling it to serve more relevant ads with higher click-through rates. Its targeting engine continues to improve, opening up a huge opportunity with e-commerce advertisers. Furthermore, the company will leverage its capabilities to offer performance-based advertising on connected TVs.\n\nConsidering the long-term growth in Connected TV advertising, AppLovin is among the top tech stocks to buy now. After growing revenues by 16% in fiscal year 2023, revenues have been accelerating. In Q1 2024, revenues grew by 47% YOY, driven by improvements in its AI-powered advertising recommendation engine, AXON.\n\nLastly, its software platform is showing incredible operating leverage. Software revenues increased from $355 to $678 million in Q1 2024, with $273 million of added revenue, or 84%, flowing to adjusted EBITDA. APP stock will soar as web-based marketing, CTV, and e-commerce advertising expand.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis maker of single-wafer cleaning equipment used in chip manufacturing is one of the best tech stocks to buy now. ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) will experience a multi-year tailwind as China aims to achieve self-sufficiency in chip production.\n\nIn the face of U.S. sanctions, the Chinese government has set a goal of semiconductor self-sufficiency. In that vein, it spent $21 billion in 2023 on wafer fabrication equipment for mature logic. Bernstein analysts estimate it must maintain the same level of spending for four more years to reach self-sufficiency.\n\nThese investment drivers have been a positive for ACM\u2019s topline. After growing revenues by 43% in 2023, analysts expect continued strength, with consensus estimates projecting 26% growth in 2024. Although it\u2019s headquartered in California, ACM Research generates most of its revenues in China through its subsidiary ACM Shanghai, which has an 82.1% ownership stake.\n\nACM Shanghai is well-positioned to benefit from the self-sufficiency and localization initiatives. Moreover, there is significant value in ACM Shanghai, publicly traded in Shanghai. As of this writing, the subsidiary is valued at almost twice the valuation of ACM Research. Management could unlock significant value for shareholders through primary or secondary stock sales.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should You Investigate ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) At US$24.09?",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR), is not the largest company out there, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGM. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ACM Research\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ACM Research\n\nIs ACM Research Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! ACM Research is still a bargain right now according to our price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. we find that ACM Research\u2019s ratio of 17.05x is below its peer average of 30.2x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Semiconductor industry. However, given that ACM Research\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will ACM Research generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 66% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ACM Research. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since ACMR is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on ACMR for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy ACMR. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing ACM Research at this point in time. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for ACM Research (1 is a bit unpleasant!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in ACM Research, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "In the fast-paced realm of technology, some tech companies often fly under the radar. These companies are often undervalued and offer significant potential. Thus, we created this list of undervalued tech stocks.\n\nWhile the mainstream tech stocks continue to dominate investor attention, particularly with the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, there are other companies quietly making substantial strides in their respective niches. These firms may not make daily news cycles. However, their technological innovations and strategic market positions enable them to offer unique value propositions.\n\nWith valuations that have not yet caught up to their growth trajectories, these under-the-radar tech stocks could be the sleeper hits of 2024. This provides both growth potential and a hedge against the volatility of their more famous counterparts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs interest rates begin to stabilize and investor appetite for growth stocks returns, it\u2019s an opportune time to consider these undervalued tech plays. They not only promise growth but also diversification away from the usual tech titans. Here\u2019s a look at three such companies. These are well-poised for appreciation. They also offer a smart blend of innovation and value in a recovering market.\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX) The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill\n\nSource: Apple\n\nHimax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is primarily known for its display driver ICs and timing controllers. The company has experienced a dip in revenues and margins throughout 2023, a trend consistent with the broader industry downturn. However, the company\u2019s resilient cash flow and robust dividend yield paint a promising picture for potential recovery and growth.\n\nHimax reported a downturn in financial performance in 2023, with revenues falling 21% from the previous year. Despite these challenges, the company\u2019s balance sheet remains strong. On their sheet, you\u2019ll see $261 million in cash and equivalents and $453 million in short-term borrowings.\n\nHimax holds a significant 40% share in the automotive display market. This segment continues to drive much of its revenue. Despite the decline in the broader market, Himax\u2019s automotive sector remains a stronghold, contributing to nearly half of its sales. This is particularly important as the market for electric vehicles and advanced automotive displays is expected to grow. Furthermore, this offers Himax potential avenues for expansion and increased market share.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock trades at a significant discount at 15.8x forward P/E, compared to the sector median of 29.6x.\n\nStory continues\n\nACM Research (ACMR) Flag of the Republic of China or Taiwan on a processor, CPU Central processing Unit or GPU microchip on a motherboard. Taiwan manufacturing chip industry emerges as battlefront in US - China showdown. TSM stock\n\nSource: William Potter / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) has carved out a niche in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment sector with its advanced cleaning and plating technologies.\n\nThe company has established itself as a key player in the single-wafer wet cleaning equipment market. This technology is critical in the semiconductor manufacturing process, ensuring high yields and superior quality, which are crucial as devices become increasingly miniaturized and complex. ACMR\u2019s flagship products, such as the Tahoe and TEBO cleaning systems, stand out for their efficiency and have been primary drivers of the company\u2019s revenue growth.\n\nThe company reported a robust year with a 105% year-over-year (YoY) revenue increase in Q1 2024. With revenue primarily generated in Mainland China, ACM Research leverages the largest market for semiconductors, benefiting from the regional growth dynamics and government-backed initiatives to boost local production capabilities.\n\nThe company appears relatively undervalued compared to its peers. With a P/E ratio significantly lower than the industry average and an EV/EBITDA multiple that underscores its market potential, ACMR presents a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nJabil (JBL) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nJabil (NYSE:JBL) is a leading provider of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. The company\u2019s diversified business model spans across various high-demand sectors, including healthcare, automotive electronics, cloud computing, and, more recently, a focus on AI-driven data centers.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, Jabil reported revenues of $34.7 billion, marking a continuation of its revenue growth trend from $29.29 billion in 2021. This growth has been driven significantly by the Diversified Manufacturing Services segment, particularly through expansions in healthcare and automotive electronics.\n\nJabil\u2019s unique position as a bridge between innovative technology solutions and global-scale manufacturing gives it a competitive edge. Its involvement in the production of cutting-edge devices, from 3D printers and biometric payment devices to telecommunications routers and smart home devices, underscores its integral role in the tech ecosystem.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock appears undervalued compared to peers in the industry. JBL currently trades at a forward P/E of 10.5x, significantly lower than the sector median of 29.6x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Most-Watched Stock ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned +3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, to which ACM Research belongs, has gained 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.60 points to a change of -1.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.75 indicates a change of +9.4% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ACM Research is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ACMR _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $164.79 million indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. For the current and next fiscal years, $707.51 million and $893.22 million estimates indicate +26.9% and +26.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $152.19 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.9%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.15 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.79%. The EPS surprise was +67.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

As of now, ACM Research, Inc. holds a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIn the context of valuation, ACM Research, Inc. is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 14.71.

(AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) leads in high-performance graphics and computer products. Its products power various devices, including game consoles and data center servers. Revenue from the Data Center category increased significantly, rising by 80% YOY to reach $2.3 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the main drivers of this expansion were the robust ramp of AMD Instinct MI300X GPU shipments and a double-digit percentage rise in server CPU sales. In a traditionally weak Q1, AMD increased its revenue share from server CPUs, particularly in business adoption and expanding cloud installations.\n\nFurther, the sales of Ryzen 8000 Series CPUs were the main driver of the\u00a085% YOY rise in revenue for the client sector, which reached $1.4 billion. The most recent generation of Ryzen CPUs was in high demand for\u00a0both\u00a0desktop and mobile applications. Adopting AI PCs and business renewal cycles may propel the PC industry back to yearly growth in 2024. This outlook offers substantial growth prospects.\n\nTo conclude, AMD is one of the top tech stocks to buy for growth potential in the semiconductor market.\u00a0This\u00a0is because of its strategic focus on tech advancement and industry-leading technologies like the EPYC CPUs and Radeon GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo seize the booming demands of the semiconductor industry, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) focuses on developing and producing semiconductor equipment. Its offerings include sophisticated packaging solutions, wafer-cleaning equipment, and more. In Q1 2024, ACM Research showed strong revenue growth, with a\u00a0105% YOY rise to $152.2 million. Revenue from many product categories reflects a diverse portfolio. Noteworthy contributions are made by advanced packaging, electrochemical plating, furnaces, and single-wafer cleaning.\n\nMoreover, the first quarter of 2024 had a\u00a0gross margin of 52.5%, beyond the predicted range of 40% to 45%, despite a little decline from the prior year, suggesting effective pricing and cost-control techniques. According to ACM Research, gross margins should stay at the top of the goal range, demonstrating consistency and assurance in sustaining profitability. Operating margin for ACM Research increased significantly, from 14.7% during the same time last year to 26.2% in Q1 2024. Hence, this significant improvement denotes improved cost control and operational efficiency.\n\nIn summary, strong gross and operating margins, a varied product mix, and steady revenue growth make ACM Research one of the top tech stocks to buy in the semiconductor equipment market.\n\nGigaCloud (GCT) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGigaCloud (NASDAQ:GCT) is a leading cloud computing and e-commerce company that provides online marketplace platforms, cloud computing services, and associated technological solutions. The company\u2019s top-line\u00a0nearly doubled to $251.1 million\u00a0in Q1 2024, against $127.8 million in Q1 2023. GigaCloud\u2019s solid top-line growth indicates a high service demand, reflecting its fundamental ability to gain market share.\n\nAdditionally, from $29.6 million in Q1 2023 to $66.5 million in Q1 2024, the gross profit climbed dramatically by\u00a0124.7% YOY. This enhancement demonstrates GigaCloud\u2019s sharp capacity to control expenses, boost productivity, and preserve high profit margins. On a trailing 12-month basis, the gross merchandise value (GMV) of the GigaCloud Marketplace boosted by 64% YOY in Q1.\u00a0This\u00a0suggests that the company\u2019s clientele and service demand are expanding. Hence, the sharp increase in GMV reflects the high activity and volume of transactions in the marketplace.\n\nOverall, GigaCloud has the potential to be a top tech stock to buy, especially in the cloud computing and e-commerce industries.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD and ACMR.

        "content": "As the Federal Reserve maintains its benchmark interest rate, investors\u2019 focus sharpens on stocks with upside potential.\n\nWith limited room for movement in any direction, the stable rate sets the stage for a significant announcement later this week. It will reveal the Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook for possible rate cuts later this year. This moment provides an excellent chance for investors to strategically set up their portfolios to capitalize on companies expected to thrive during these times.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. labor market remains robust. Although the unemployment rate ticked up to 4%, the slight increase does not detract from its overall strength. This, coupled with continued job gains, adds to overall market stability. As we break down these economic indicators, understanding their interplay becomes critical for identifying investment possibilities with robust growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, these top three stocks with upside potential should be your go-to investments any day of the week.\n\nStocks With Upside Potential: Alibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is one of China\u2019s largest and most valuable companies. It is a leader in e-commerce and digital payments. Despite a tumultuous economic climate and a prolonged crackdown by Beijing authorities on digital enterprises, Alibaba has shown extraordinary resilience and managed to keep its footing.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s administration of China\u2019s key eCommerce sites, Tmall and Taobao, has been critical to expanding its market reach and cementing its supremacy. The firm posted solid quarterly performance, with Taobao and Tmall seeing a double-digit bump in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). Additionally, its foreign commerce revenue skyrocketed by 45%, while cloud revenue increased significantly, owing mostly to a triple-digit increase in AI-related sales.\n\nYet, with such compelling financial performance, shares of BABA currently trade at just 9.53 times forward earnings, a valuation that underscores the stock\u2019s potential for a comeback. This sentiment is echoed by TipRanks analysts, assigning Alibaba a Strong Buy rating with a remarkable 32% upside from its current value.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor companies have been bustling since generative AI took the world by storm in 2023. Among these, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) stole the spotlight. Specializing in supplying advanced equipment for chip manufacturing, ACMR has achieved notable breakthroughs. Particularly, its Frame Wafer Cleaning Tool worked wonders to enhance efficiency and remove contaminants. This growing influence of ACMR has led its stock to surge by 106% over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, ACMR performed exceptionally in its first quarter. The company reported a whopping 105% revenue increase, reaching $152.19 million, and operating income also jumped to $25.2 million from $8.9 million. That marks the eighth straight quarter ACMR has exceeded estimates, highlighting its strategic strength and operational excellence.\n\nLooking ahead, ACMR is gearing up for more expansion. It\u2019s recently planning to start production at its new facility in Lingang, Shanghai. Additionally, ACMR invests in its U.S. and Korean operations to tap into global opportunities.\n\nThese superb advancements and growth led TipRanks analysts to assign it a Strong Buy rating with a mind-boggling 69.17% upside.\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm.

Though there has been choppiness in the crypto market lately, the bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin remains firmly intact.\n\nFollowing these trends, Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), aBitcoin mining upstart, positions itself to capitalize on the underlying market dynamics.\n\nIt\u2019s not just its price, though, as Bitfarms has considerably raised its hashrate, demonstrating its dedication to growing its mining operation. In Q1 2024, Bitfarms achieved a 7.6% rise in its hashrate, reaching 7.0 EH/s from 6.5 EH/s sequentially. Furthermore, it\u2019s moving towards bigger goals, with the company intending to treble its hashrate to 21 EH/s by the end of 2024. This expansion points to a massive increase in mining activity in the upcoming quarters.\n\nFurthermore, with zero debt and $124 million in liquidity, Bitfarms is an excellent vehicle to ride the crypto market. TipRanks analysts reinforce this outlook by assigning Bitfarms a Strong Buy rating and predicting a staggering 66.7% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you\u2019re trying to hone in on which tech stocks to buy this month, you\u2019ve come to the right place. The technology sector continues to carry the stock market higher. In just six months, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tripled its market valuation to $3 trillion and replaced Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable stock (it recently slipped back to third place).\n\nYet other tech stocks are performing just as good or better than the chipmaker. Software company Dave (NASDAQ:DAVE) has quadrupled in value this year, rising almost 400%. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is up 170%, though that has more to do with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bubbling up again.\n\nWhat it shows, though, is significant profit-making opportunities remain in the sector and the following three tech stocks to buy could be the next to explode higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year\u2019s tech darling Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is growing slower this year \u2013 but not by much. After tacking on 250% gains in 2023, it is \u201conly\u201d 172% higher this time around. But that\u2019s because SMCI stock slipped 37% below the all-time high it hit in March. Now is the time for the next leg up.\n\nSuper Micro reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat Wall Street\u2019s top and bottom line estimates but didn\u2019t offer blow-the-doors-off guidance for the rest of the year. The stock market sold off its shares because SMCI\u2019s outlook for the fourth quarter said revenue would only triple from last year to as much as $5.8 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized computers, servers, networks, storage solutions and workstations for data centers and other industries. The need for more capacity has hyperscalers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) building new data centers all over the country. There will be no lack of demand for Super Micro\u2019s equipment.\n\nSMCI stock earnings are expected to grow a whopping 62% every year for the next five years yet it trades at a fraction of that growth rate. That makes Super Micro Computer a tech stock to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another discounted tech stock to buy because it also has no end in sight to its growth potential. Like death and taxes, hackers and cybercrime will always be with us in the connected computer age. LexisNexis Risk Solutions says \u201chuman-initiated digital attacks\u201d are up 19% globally from last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Palo Alto\u2019s stock is only up 1% in 2024. The market is worried that billings growth is slowing. It rose just 3% in the fiscal third quarter to $2.3 billion. But that resulted from the cybersecurity outfit offering program bundling discounts to existing customers.\n\nIt is also benefiting from customers consolidating where they spend their money on security. Rather than numerous different vendors, they are buying more Palo Alto modules under its new, single-platform offering. Particularly with the growth of AI, the cybersecurity leader has new program packages that offer superior protection.\n\nPalo Alto Network\u2019s lower price gives investors the chance to buy into this tech stock at a discount.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced wafer cleaning technologies and equipment (WFE) supplier ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is another tech stock the market wrongly sold off. Shares are down 38% from its 52-week high though it remains 16% above where it started the year.\n\nPart of the reason for the pullback is ACM\u2019s market is declining, but only through this year. Analysts at Gartner predict the WFE industry will fall 4% this year after a 10% decline in 2023. However, starting in 2025, it will reverse and see 10% growth with significant gains continuing through 2027. It is easy to see why.\n\nDemand for computer chips is growing, especially due to the needs of AI. ACM Research\u2019s equipment is essential because it eliminates contaminants from wafer surfaces at the front end of the chip processing cycle. Chip manufacturers need pristine surfaces before they begin making the wafers.\n\nThe specialized nature of its equipment will be necessary as chip companies face secular growth trends. That should push ACMR stock to new heights in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -10%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, which ACM Research falls in, has lost 12.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share, indicating a change of -37.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -37% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.60 points to a change of -1.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -18%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.75 indicates a change of +9.4% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -22.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for ACM Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ACMR _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $164.08 million indicates a year-over-year change of +13.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $698.4 million and $884.31 million estimates indicate +25.2% and +26.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $152.19 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.9%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.15 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.79%. The EPS surprise was +67.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) took the world by storm in 2023. Semiconductor companies have been ever busy since then. There is a plethora of complex components \u2014 hardware and software \u2014 that go into making the silicon chips that power large language models (LLMs). Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably the largest beneficiary of the AI craze. Over the past 12 months, the acclaimed GPU maker\u2019s share price has nearly quadrupled in value, making it one of the most lucrative semiconductor trades in a while.\n\nEquities investors looking to invest in semiconductor stocks should perhaps look beyond Nvidia. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily imply they would be avoiding exposure to AI. Without further ado, below are the three most undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy in June 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is perhaps the most consequential chipmaker on the globe. In particular, TSM is a contract manufacturer that builds Nvidia\u2019s advanced AI chips as well as the silicon for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The contract chip manufacturer has enjoyed sizable earnings growth over the past couple of quarters due to a recovering consumer electronics market and robust demand for AI chips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024 saw revenue rise 16.5% to NTD 592.6 billion ($18.6 billion), while net income increased 8.8% to NTD 225.5 billion ($7.2 billion). The firm accounted for about 61% of global chip foundry sales in Q4 of 2023, and this solid position in the market will make TSMC poised to capture the AI demand in the market.\n\nCurrently, the company can produce chips at a 3-nanometer process, and the business is aiming to be able to bring 2-nanometer production to the broader market by 2024.\n\nTrading at 26.5x forward earnings, the stock appears undervalued, and given its role in manufacturing AI chips, TSMC could make a good long-term bet on the space.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is in the business of designing and selling microchips to power data processing across vast networks. Optical technology has proliferated with the rise of data centers and cloud networks. For example, optical interconnects have begun to replace traditional copper wires to facilitate data interchange between servers. The rise of artificial intelligence models has, in turn, increased demand for fast optical interconnects and network chips that help process data.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutside of network chips, Broadcom also designs custom AI chips for clients. At an event in March, the tech firm unveiled a sophisticated XPU designed for a consumer \u201cconsumer AI company.\u201d That part of Broadcom\u2019s business has Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a major client and also commands a high gross margin.\n\nBroadcom expects to sell about $10 billion worth of AI chips in 2024. While there will definitely be some competition from Nvidia, Broadcom\u2019s comparatively lower valuation makes it a compelling choice for an AI chip bet.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final entry on this list is ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR). This semiconductor firm provides the sophisticated equipment semiconductor foundries use to manufacture chips. In essence, the point of ACM\u2019s business is to enhance the yields for integrated chips during the manufacturing process.\n\nACM Research\u2019s Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024 saw the firm increase revenue by 105% on a year-over-year basis to $152.2 million. That reflected higher sales of various core products, including single wafer and semi-critical cleaning equipment. Shipments, which include deliveries for revenue recognized during the quarter and \u201cfirst tool systems\u201d that may lead to sales in future quarters, skyrocketed 175% from last year to $245 million.\n\nACMR is seeing major growth and success as its mainland China customers have increased spending on mature, advanced node technology. The semiconductor firm trades at just 14.3x forward earnings, and its growth opportunity in China and other parts of East Asia makes it undervalued.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Next Big Things: 7 Tech Stocks to Get In on Early",
        "content": "Investing in early bird innovators always presents risks but these types of tech stocks to buy generally offer the biggest upside potential. Sure, you can always bet on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) like everyone else. However, there may be much more robust rewards to be had betting on lesser-known enterprises.\n\nIt\u2019s a tradeoff between predictability and profitability. By going after a well-established enterprise, you have reasonable assurances that the investment will rise in value. However, the upside could be limited. On the other hand, targeting smaller-capitalization firms presents huge predictability conundrums. Still, if the stars align, the ensuing upside could be massive.\n\nIt really comes down to your risk tolerance. If you can handle the heat, these are the tech stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOuster (OUST) LiDAR sensors show car sensing traffic around it. LAZR\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, Ouster (NYSE:OUST) provides lidar sensors for the automotive, industrial, robotics and smart infrastructure sectors. Its products include high-resolution scanning and solid-state digital lidar sensors. In addition, the company offers analog lidar sensors and related software solutions. Given the broader push for autonomy, OUST could be one of the tech stocks to buy.\n\nExperts have high hopes for OUST stock. Right now, they\u2019ve set a moderate buy rating on OUST with a $13.25 average price target. That implies about 10% upside potential. During the trailing 12 months (TTM), the company posted a net loss of $220.68 million or $4.62 per share. However, during the period, sales landed at $91.99 million. Further, the quarterly revenue growth (year-over-year) rate stand sat 50.6%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are targeting a loss per share of $2.31, a big improvement from last year\u2019s loss of $10.10. On the top line, sales could hit $116.61 million, up 40%. Not only that, the high-side target could reach $118.9 million. It\u2019s one of the top tech stocks to buy for speculators.\n\nPAR Technology (PAR) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in New Hartford, New York, PAR Technology (NYSE:PAR) with its subsidiaries provides omnichannel cloud-based hardware and software solutions. Its main clients are found in the restaurant and retail industries worldwide. For eateries specifically, PAR offers PUNCHH, an enterprise-grade customer loyalty and engagement solution. That could be vital since consumers are willing to spend; it\u2019s just that they\u2019re pickier about where they do their spending.\n\nAnalysts recognize the growth opportunity, rating shares a consensus moderate buy. Further, the average price target lands at $53.20, implying almost 21% upside potential. The high-side target goes up to $61. During the TTM period, the company posted a net loss of $72.14 million or down $2.57 per share. Still, during the period, revenue reached $420.88 million. The quarterly YOY growth rate came in at 5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe PAR will lose 67 cents per share, an improvement over last year\u2019s loss of $1.52. On the top line, sales may reach $471 million, up 13.3% from 2023\u2019s tally of $415.82 million. It\u2019s another solid (albeit speculative) example of tech stocks to buy.\n\nZuora (ZUO) zuora logo\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHailing Redwood City, California, Zuora (NYSE:ZUO) falls under the infrastructure software sector. Per its public profile, the company provides what\u2019s known as a monetization suite for modern businesses. Primarily, Zuora helps companies launch and scale new services. It also helps the customer experience (CX) angle, helping to nurture and build loyal followings.\n\nWith the competitive arena in the consumer economy, every customer counts. Zuora provides an edge for its clients, which makes it an intriguing idea among tech stocks to buy. Analysts are moderately bullish on the idea, forecasting a price per share of $12.20. That implies about 24% upside potential. During the TTM period, Zuroa lost $62.61 million or 44 cents per share. However, it also posted sales of $438.34 million.\n\nFor the current fiscal year (2025), experts believe that earnings per share will hit 43 cents, up 30.3% from the prior year. On the top line, sales might fly up to $454.22 million, up 5.2% from last year\u2019s print of $431.66 million. Also, fiscal 2026\u2019s consensus sales target lands at just under $497 million or up 9.4%.\n\nApplied Optoelectronics (AAOI) Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background.

Tech Stocks to buy\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Sugar Land, Texas, Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) designs, manufactures and sells fiber-optic networking products in the U.S., Taiwan and China. Per its corporate profile, Applied offers optic modules and fibers. It also specializes in lasers, laser components and various subassemblies. With the broader connectivity ecosystem becoming more complex while absorbing rising demand, Applied could see long-term growth.\n\nAnalysts are also keeping watch on AAOI, rating shares a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $15.33, implying 44.9% upside potential. Further, the high-side target hits $18, projecting over 70% growth. During the TTM period, Applied posted a net loss of $62.93 million or $1.79 per share. Revenue hit $205.29 million, though this admittedly represented a YOY loss of 23.3%.\n\nHowever, some patience may be in order. Experts believe that Applied may incur a loss per share of 41 cents, slightly better than last year\u2019s loss of 42 cents. On the top line, revenue could soar to $272.21 million. That would be up 25.1% from last year\u2019s result of $217.65 million. For gamblers, AAOI could be one of the enticing tech stocks to buy.\n\nOddity (ODD) APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Israel, Oddity (NASDAQ:ODD) also falls under the infrastructure software space. According to its public profile, Oddity operates as a consumer tech firm that builds digital-first brands. Primarily, the enterprise focuses on the beauty and wellness industries in the U.S. along with other international markets. It may draw attention from speculators because it leverages artificial intelligence to identify consumer needs. From there, it brings solutions to the table.\n\nWith so much focus on AI, it\u2019s inevitable that it would touch many other industries. Why should beauty care be any different? Indeed, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $53 average price target. That implies over 45% upside potential. During the TTM period, net income landed at $71.93 million or $1.26 per share. Revenue hit $554.66 million, up 27.8% on a YOY basis.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe that EPS will hit $1.60, implying 22.1% expansion. On the top line, sales may rise to $633.44 million, implying 24.5% up from last year\u2019s haul of $508.69 million. Further, fiscal 2025 sales may reach $765.51 million. It\u2019s worth consideration for tech stocks to buy.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Fremont, California, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) develops, manufactures and sells single wafer wet cleaning equipment. This process enhances manufacturing protocols and improves yield for integrated chips worldwide. With so much attention paid to semiconductor performance these days, investors may want to consider critical \u201cstagehand\u201d managers. One of the most important that keeps the wheels turning is ACM.\n\nAnalysts aren\u2019t waiting around for approval from anyone. Presently, they rate shares a unanimous strong buy with an average price target of $37.91. That implies an upside potential of over 65%. Further, the high-side target lands at $40. During the TTM period, ACM posted a net income of $87.64 million, translating to $1.31 per share. Revenue during this time hit $635.66 million. The quarterly sales growth rate currently clocks in at 105%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts are seeking an improvement in EPS of 6.7% to reach $1.74 per share. On the top line, sales could hit $698.81 million, a rise of 25.3% from last year\u2019s tally of $557.72 million. In fiscal 2025, revenue may reach $865.79 million, up 23.9%. It\u2019s one of the tech stocks to buy or at least to put on your radar.\n\nStratasys (SSYS) Stratasys (SSYS) logo on a black background\n\nSource: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) is arguably the riskiest idea on this list of tech stocks to buy. According to its corporate profile, Stratasys focuses on a range of 3D printing systems. These include polyjet printers along with what\u2019s known as fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers. To be fair, SSYS has tumbled almost 61% in the past five years. Still, a broader innovation sector renaissance could boost demand.\n\nAnalysts believe in SSYS, rating shares a consensus strong buy. Further, the average price target lands at $15, implying over 67% upside potential. In addition, the blue-sky price target screams toward $23. During the TTM period, Stratasys posted a net loss of $126.83 million or $1.83 per share. Revenue reached $622.27 million, which was actually a loss of 3.6% YOY.\n\nOn the bottom line, analysts are seeking EPS of 14 cents, an improvement of 27.3% from last year\u2019s result of 11 cents. The top line could see stasis, coming in at $633.2 million (compared to last year\u2019s $627.6 million). However, fiscal 2025 revenue could rise to $674.9 million, with a high-side target of $682 million.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on ACM Research is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.11 = US$112m \u00f7 (US$1.6b - US$533m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, ACM Research has an ROCE of 11%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 9.7% generated by the Semiconductor industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for ACM Research  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for ACM Research compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for ACM Research .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nIn terms of ACM Research's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 17%, but since then they've fallen to 11%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\n\nOur Take On ACM Research's ROCE\n\nEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for ACM Research. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 278% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nACM Research does have some risks, we noticed  2 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this freelist of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Investors in ACM Research, Inc ACMR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 21, 2024 $15.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for ACM Research shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, ACM Research is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Semiconductor Equipment-Material Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 1% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analyst has increased its earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped its estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 37 cents per share to 30 cents per share in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about ACM Research right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR).\n\nACM Research currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by six brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the six recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ACMR Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ACMR\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ACM Research here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying ACM Research, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ACMR a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ACM Research, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 18% over the past month to $1.60.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for ACM Research. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for ACM Research with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite, which holds a number of high-growth technology stocks, has rallied 13.38% as of the end of Wednesday\u2019s trading session. The tech giants of the market, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) chip maker, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), have helped to keep U.S. equities edging higher.\n\nAlso, macroeconomics will play a pivotal role in shaping out the way in which the rally continues. The U.S. Federal Reserve remains cautious about cutting rates. But better economic data on inflation could help to assure them as well as drive higher equities performance.\n\nHowever, not every high-flying stock has to look like Nvidia. Rather, several, high-growth stocks have delivered solid performance for investors. Their businesses effectively capitalize on tailwinds present in their respective markets despite all the macroeconomic noise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s examine three such stocks that investors should grab now.\n\nFrontline (FRO) 3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocks\n\nSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Cyprus, Frontline (NYSE:FRO) is a contract oil shipping company that manages a fleet of 76 oil tankers that transport crude. Geopolitics as well as environmental incidents have been a boon for the shipping firm, as well as many others.\n\nThe Houthi rebels in Yemen have made traveling through the Suez Canal riskier than it has been in the past. This has forced shipping companies destined to Europe or Asia to take a longer route around the continent of Africa. Similarly, the Panama Canal has suffered from an unusual dry season that has prevented ships from passing through at high volumes. Both of these factors have risen shipping rates, effectively boosting profits for companies like Frontline.\n\nIn its recent Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024, revenue came in at $578.5 million, which represented a 16% year-over-year (YOY) increase. The company reported EPS of 81 cents per share. A strong oil demand outlook, including China, India and Japan, have kept oil tanker companies busy and will continue to do so throughout 2024.\n\nFRO shares have risen more than 45% year-to-date (YTD). Yet, the stock still only trades at 7.7x forward earnings, making FRO stock a bargain.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a little-known semiconductor firm that has seen shares more than double over the past 12 months.\n\nThe semiconductor firm specializes in wet-cleaning and other front-end processing equipment that help larger original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) develop logic and memory chips. DRAM and NAND memory chips have been in high demand ever since generative AI made significant waves last year. In turn, ACM Research has experienced rapid sales growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, ACM Research was able to increase sales by 105% YOY to $152.2 million. Also, quarterly EPS more than doubled from the same period last year as well, setting at around 26 cents per share.\n\nTrading at only 14.4x forward earnings, ACMR seems like a good way to play the semiconductor equipment space.\n\nEmbraer (ERJ) The Embraer Logo\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlane-maker Embraer (NYSE:ERJ) deserves some attention.\n\nWhile Embraer is regarded for its executive private jets, the firm\u2019s E2 passenger jets have received a lot of buzz recently. In fact, for the year of 2023, of the 181 jets the company delivered, 64 of them were commercial jets. That\u2019s a 12% increase from the raw number reported in 2022. In Q1 of 2024, Embraer reported similarly positive results. Commercial aviation backlog increased by $2.3 billion or 26% sequentially.\n\nAdditionally, the E195-E2 passenger jet continues to expand its reach with a new-type certifications from China, Singapore and the U.K. A new report says Embraer may be manufacturing a plane to compete with Boeing\u2019s controversial 737-MAX and Airbus\u2019s A320 variant. It could be a major growth tailwind for the plane-maker.\n\nERJ has risen 52% YTD, yet still trades at 22.7x forward earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "While the standard financial advice calls for acquiring shares of stable, steady names, sometimes investors feel the need to dial up the risk-reward ratio. If you need to kickstart your holdings, these analyst-backed ideas might be able to convert $1,000 into a hefty bag down the line.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll want to conduct your due diligence. Because these ideas are a bit away from the tried-and-true path, some volatility could materialize. Still, Wall Street experts project big things over the horizon. With that in mind, below are top stocks to buy for speculators.\n\nTaboola.com (TBLA) TBLA stock: Taboola company website with logo close up\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nBased in New York City, Taboola.com (NASDAQ:TBLA) with its subsidiaries operates an artificial-intelligence-based algorithmic engine platform. Per its public profile, the communication services firm offers its namesake platform, which partners with websites, devices and mobile apps to recommend editorial content and advertisements on the open web. Analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $5.90 average price target, implying 47.5% upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Taboola incurred a net loss of almost $77 million on revenue of $1.53 billion. On a per-share basis, the red ink comes out to 23 cents. Throughout the past five years, the growth rate has been patchy. Nevertheless, during this period, the average top-line expansion came out to just under 10%.\n\nEven better, analysts anticipate big growth by the end of this year. Sales could hit $1.95 billion, up 35.65% from the prior year. Also, earnings per share might land at 33 cents, a far cry from 2023\u2019s result of a loss of 24 cents. With content only expanding in the digital realm, TBLA makes a great idea for top stocks to buy for speculation.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 1998 and entering the public market in November 2017, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) falls under the technology umbrella. Specifically, it deals with the semiconductor equipment and materials sector. Per its corporate profile, ACM develops, manufactures and sells single-wafer wet cleaning equipment for enhancing the manufacturing process. The service also helps improve yield for integrated chips worldwide.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cstagehand\u201d investment that, while it may not get the spotlight helps keep the show running smoothly. As a result, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with a $37.91 average price target. That implies upside potential of almost 68%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, ACM posted net income of $87.64 million on sales of $635.66 million. On a per-share basis, earnings came out to $1.32. By the end of this year, analysts are looking for EPS of $1.77 on revenue of $712.79 million. On both counts, these figures represent massive improvements.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking out to 2025, EPS could land at $1.91 on revenue of $883.11 million. With so much relevance on hand, ACMR makes a strong case for top stocks to buy.\n\nChefs\u2019 Warehouse (CHEF) The Chefs' Warehouse logo on a truck. CHEF stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nFounded in 1985, Chefs\u2019 Warehouse (NASDAQ:CHEF) falls under the food distribution industry. Specifically, it works in the consumer staples subsector. According to its profile, Chefs\u2019 distributes specialty food and center-of-the-plate products in the U.S., the Middle East and Canada. These specialty items include artisan charcuterie, unique oils and vinegars and truffles and other pastry products.\n\nIt\u2019s a risky idea given the ambiguities surrounding the consumer economy. However, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with a $49.33 average price target. That implies almost 29% upside potential. During the TTM period, Chefs\u2019 posted a net income of $35.12 million on sales of $3.59 billion. On a per-share basis, the company delivered earnings of 88 cents.\n\nBy the end of the year, experts anticipate that EPS will hit $1.39 on revenue of $3.84 billion. If so, that would imply earnings growth of nearly 26% while the top line would have expanded by almost 12%. The following year could see EPS climb to $1.75 on sales of $4.12 billion.\n\nIf you believe in these expert projections, CHEF could be one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The benchmark ETF for the semiconductor industry as a whole is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which has returned 69% in the past year, while the S&P 500 has only returned 26% within the same time period.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have been on the cutting edge of innovation, and investors are still very interested in the industry\u2019s ability to adapt and change.\n\nBelow, I discuss three semiconductor stocks that may not be very well known compared to industry giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). However, these stocks are up-and-coming stocks that have seen impressive share price appreciation and still hold a decent valuation with room to grow within this rapidly evolving industry.\r\n\r\nHere are some semiconductor stocks to buy:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: ACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) primarily supplies the semiconductor industry with wafer cleaning and wet processing equipment. It also offers electrochemical plating services.\n\nOn May 8,\u00a0earnings for the first quarter of 2024 were released. Total revenue and net income both doubled year-over-year to $152 million and $22 million, respectively. Earnings for the first quarter beat analyst expectations, similar to Q4 2023.\n\nFirst-quarter shipments increased by 175% compared to the previous year. The overall outlook for the full year 2024 remained the same: ACMR predicts that total revenue will be between $650 million and $725 million.\n\nOver the past year, its share price has increased by 130%. And it\u2019s still trading at a strong valuation, especially within the semiconductor industry. Its forward P/E ratio is 12.98 times, while the sector average is 23.94 times.\n\nACMR still offers investors the capabilities of very strong returns, especially if it keeps beating analyst predictions regarding earnings.\n\nASE Technology (ASX) Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ADR) (NYSE:ASX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nASX Technology (NYSE:ASX) is a semiconductor and testing company that provides a wide range of industry support services.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has risen by 48%.\n\nOn Apr. 25, ASE Technology\u00a0reported earnings results for the first quarter of 2024, stating that total revenue increased by 1% and net income fell by 2% year over year.\n\nASE Technology also provides investors with a strong dividend yield, which is an anomaly, particularly for the semiconductor industry. Its dividend is distributed on an annual basis. The most recent dividend given to investors was fifty-six cents per share, paid out on Aug. 3, 2023. Its overall yield at this time is approximately 5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilar to ACMR, ASX is trading at a fair valuation compared to the sector as a whole. Its forward P/E ratio is 17.97 times, while the sector\u2019s median forward P/E is 23.94 times.\n\nASE Technology has experienced solid share price appreciation and still offers a fair valuation to investors.\u00a0Definitely one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy, in my opinion.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) specializes in the production and distribution of photomask technology for use in the manufacturing of integrated circuits and flat panel displays. It sells its products to various semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has increased by 29%.\n\nOn May 22, Photronics\u00a0reported earnings for the second quarter of 2024, stating that total revenue of $217 million and net income of $56 million fell by 5% year over year.\n\nPLAB also provided guidance for the third quarter, in which it anticipates revenue will be between $221 million and $229 million.\n\nPhotoronics has also had some\u00a0recent leadership changes. Its previous Chief Financial Officer, John Jordan, retired in February. On May 28, Eric Rivera, the interim CFO following John Jordan\u2019s retirement, was named its new CFO.\n\nPLAB is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 13.00 times, while the median sector P/E is 23.94 times.\n\nThe recent lackluster earnings report somewhat shocked investors into selling their shares. But, with an improved outlook for the third quarter of 2024 over Q2. PLAB still offers decent potential for investors looking for semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "Hypergrowth stocks are the holy grail of traders and growth investors. These stocks can multiply a small position by two, five, 10 times, or more. In many cases, analysts like to project what stocks they believe can deliver this kind of market-beating performance in the future.\n\nHowever, this article analyzes three stocks that have posted a 100% or higher increase in share price over the last 12 months. Past results don\u2019t always equate to future performance. And it\u2019s fair to note that many hypergrowth stocks can\u2019t sustain that return over time. Many have even failed. However,\u00a0each stock on this list appears likely to move even higher.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that none of these stocks is named Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The Magnificent 7 stock could have easily made this list, but it seems too easy. Instead, the hypergrowth stocks on this list may be able to give you Nvidia-like gains but for, perhaps, far less investment capital.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs noted, Nvidia is not on this list, but that doesn\u2019t mean we ignored the chip sector altogether. ACM Research (NYSE:ACMR) is a picks-and-shovels play on the likely rise in semiconductor stocks. This growth isn\u2019t just due to Nvidia\u2019s strong earnings report. Advanced semiconductor chips are going to be essential to the growing AI economy.\n\nACM Research is the leading provider of semiconductor cleaning equipment essential in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips. Specifically, the company handles wafer cleaning, a market that experts believe will achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% through 2030, promoting a valuation of $5.77 billion. In 2023, ACM had over $557 million in revenue, about 13% of the total market valuation of $4.23 billion.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company nearly doubled its revenue on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. However, ACM stock is down 16.5% in the month following its earnings report. That may be due to the softness in the wafer fab equipment market, which is expected to continue this year before picking up in 2025.\n\nTidewater (TDW) A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. top growth stocks\n\nSource: MEE KO DONG / Shutterstock\n\nThe next of these hypergrowth stocks comes from the energy sector. Tidewater (NYSE:TDW) operates a fleet of marine service vessels supporting the energy industry\u2019s exploration and production efforts. Capital expenditures in this sector are expected to grow significantly in the coming years as global oil production will increase due to rising demand.\n\nTDW stock has been up 118% in the last 12 months and will be up 42.5% in 2024. That\u2019s notable because the first quarter is historically the company\u2019s slowest quarter from an activity perspective \u2013 by the company\u2019s admission. Yet Tidewater delivered YOY revenue growth of 66% in the quarter, and earnings were up a whopping 286% YOY.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts have a consensus price target of $119.83, 16.5% higher than its closing price on May 24, 2024. However, BTIG Research has reiterated its Buy rating on TDW stock since the company\u2019s earnings report and raised its price target from $110 to $130.\n\nContext Therapeutics (CNTX) Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock\n\nContext Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CNTX) is a pre-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company in the early stages of developing drugs to combat solid tumors. In early May 2024, the company received FDA clearance for its IND application to bring its CTIM-76 candidate into Phase 1 clinical trials. CTIM-76 is \u201ca promising Claudin 6 (CLDNG) x CD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual to see biopharmaceutical companies on a list of hypergrowth stocks. That\u2019s because all it takes is one blockbuster drug to send revenue soaring and turn unprofitable stocks profitable. On the other hand, many of these companies never make it through the clinical trial stage.\n\nHowever, in May 2024, Context also completed a private placement that netted the company gross proceeds of approximately $100 million. This will allow the company to begin the Phase 1 trial.\n\nCNTX stock has been up 138% in the last 12 months, but investors should remember that this is still a penny stock that trades for just $2 a share. It\u2019s not only unprofitable, but the company is still in the pre-revenue stage. Like many penny stocks, it doesn\u2019t receive much analyst coverage, but the three analysts that have issued price targets have a consensus price of $6.50, which would be a 225% gain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When it comes to media and investor attention, semiconductor stocks are among some of the hottest right now. This is because of artificial intelligence, and the expected shift to accelerated computing for businesses and consumers. With the PHLX Semiconductor (SOX) index up by over 50% in the past year, some semiconductor companies have seen even better performance. In this article, we'll take a closer look at ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR), which is one the high growth semiconductor stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR)\n\nACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a mid-sized semiconductor manufacturing equipment designer and seller.

(NASDAQ:ACMR)'s Recent Performance\n\nACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR)'s latest financial results were quite impressive in terms of annual growth. For its first quarter of 2024 earnings, the firm reported $152 million in revenue and $17.4 million in net income. The net income translated into basic earnings per share of $0.28. Additionally, ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR)'s first-quarter non-GAAP net income per diluted share stood at $0.52, which not only beat analyst estimates, but also added to a string of beats from the previous quarters.\n\nACM Research, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ACMR)'s figures for the past three and five year average annualized revenue growth rates as of December 2023 are 52.71% and 49.52%, respectively. In dollar terms, annual revenue between 2020 and 2023 sat at $156 million, $259 million, $388 million, and $557 million, respectively. This means that on an absolute basis, revenue more than doubled in 2023 in comparison to 2020, as is also the case with several other high growth semiconductor stocks. Taking a deeper look at its income statement, ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) has also demonstrated impressive operating and net income growth.\n\nWhat Are Analysts Saying About ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR)?\n\nSince ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a small-cap stock and has a market capitalization under $2 billion, not many analysts are covering it.

        "title": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -16.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, which ACM Research falls in, has lost 13.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share, indicating a change of -37.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -43.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.60 points to a change of -1.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -18%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.75 indicates a change of +9.4% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -22.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for ACM Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ACMR _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate of $164.08 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.5%. The $698.4 million and $884.31 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +25.2% and +26.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $152.19 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.9%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.15 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.79%. The EPS surprise was +67.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering which stocks to buy for the next economic upturn, you\u2019re in the right place. Finding profitable investment opportunities in the constantly changing global economy is crucial to profiting from the next economic boom. These seven exceptional stocks with solid growth potential and tactical advantages may lead in their respective industries.\n\nThe first one stands out as a strong competitor in the financial industry because of its steady revenue growth and sensible diversification tactics. Driven by strong demand for its cutting-edge GPUs, the second semiconductor company in the market has seen outstanding growth in its data center division.\n\nMeanwhile, the third one is notable for its adaptability and effectiveness in AI applications, and a significant portion of its income comes from AI inference. With its strategic connection to new market trends like the business refresh cycle and AI PCs, the fourth one has a promising future. The sixth one leads on its successful marketing and positive financial outlook; the seventh has its strategic efforts and potential for future growth. Finally, the fifth one has solid financial standing and an emphasis on innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: SoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, adjusted net revenue for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) increased by 26% year-over-year (YOY) to $581 million. It is the 12th straight quarter of a boost of more than 25%. Such stable growth highlights the business\u2019s revenue-generating solid capacities and long-term growth sustainability.\n\nMoreover, SoFi\u2019s fundamental advantage is the diversity of its top-line. In Q1, the combined sectors of financial services and technology platforms held 42% of the adjusted net revenue, up from 33% and 40% in the prior quarters. As reflected in this trend, by 2024\u2019s end, it may attain a nearly equal revenue distribution between these segments and loans, pointing to a strategy move in that direction.\n\nFinally, in Q1, SoFi\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was\u00a0$144 million, a 91% YOY increase. This growth reflects significant operating leverage, as the EBITDA margin increased to 25% from 16% during Q1 2023. Therefore, the company\u2019s operations are now more scalable and cost-effective.\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Data Center division of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) saw record sales of $2.3 billion,\u00a0up 2% sequentially and 80% YOY. Instinct MI300X GPU sales acceleration and a double-digit percentage gain in server CPU sales propelled growth. AMD increased its revenue share from server CPUs, especially in cloud and business installations.\u00a0Indeed, these numbers demonstrate AMD\u2019s dominant position in the data center industry. This\u00a0is the result of its creative products and calculated market penetration.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the client segment expansion results from a\u00a0$1.4 billion increase in sales, or 85% YOY. This is driven by the most recent generation of Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. These have seen double-digit growth in desktop Ryzen CPUs and nearly a doubling of sales of mobile Ryzen CPUs YOY. Overall, AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPUs are in high demand, and the client segment has had remarkable growth, demonstrating the success of its product plans.\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: NVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Data Center business area for NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be the engine driving its growth trajectory. This segment\u2019s record sales of $22.6 billion in Q1 2024 were a 427% YOY growth. The main force driving this increase is the broad deployment of the Nvidia Hopper GPU computing platform and AI inference by major cloud providers, businesses, and consumer internet firms.\n\nMoreover, companies like Meta (NASDAQ:META) have invested heavily in Nvidia\u2019s AI infrastructure. Developed on a cluster of 24K H100 GPUs, Meta\u2019s Llama 3 delivers new AI-driven features that increase user engagement and open up new income sources for the company.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has a lot of room to develop in the automotive industry, especially with its AI infrastructure supporting autonomous driving technology. An excellent example is Nvidia\u2019s partnership with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The company powers Tesla\u2019s FSD Version 12 autonomous driving software with its AI infrastructure. In short, Tesla\u2019s installation of 35K H100 GPUs highlights how important Nvidia\u2019s technology is to advancing autonomous car capabilities.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the main factors influencing Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) development potential is its leadership in technology and placement in rising industry trends. Strong future demand for AI PCs is reflected in the projected Enterprise refresh cycle and increased momentum for these devices. This trend\u00a0is supported\u00a0by Intel\u2019s expertise in creating and managing the AI PC category and the growing availability of AI PC CPUs.\n\nMoreover, an improvement in the data center industry indicates\u00a0the return to more regular CPU purchasing patterns and the increasing availability of accelerators. This\u00a0solidifies the impending release of Intel 18A products.\n\nFurther, Intel anticipates growth in both EPS and sales for 2024, with\u00a0H2 2024 seeing an acceleration in revenue growth. Strategic measures and rising demand signals underpin this optimistic forecast. Intel\u2019s commitment to providing value is reflected in the announcement of a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share, boosting the Street\u2019s confidence. Despite large expenditures in technology and capacity growth, Intel expects considerable capital offsets in H2 2024, resulting in about neutrally adjusted free cash flow for 2024.\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: ACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) had $288 million in time deposits and cash.

The corporation must prioritize research and development to meet market demands and maintain long-term growth.\n\nOverall, ACM Research\u2019s edge reflects its ongoing development of cutting-edge packaging tools, its successful qualification of the\u00a0Ultra C v Vacuum Cleaning Tool, and its advancements in developing the Track and Plasma Enhanced chemical vapor deposition\u00a0platforms.\u00a0As a result, these advances are anticipated to drive top-line growth and market expansion.\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nHims & Hers (NYSE:HIMS) excels in marketing efficiency, taking a leading position in this crucial area. Compared to Q1 2023, marketing costs as a proportion of sales increased by nearly 4%, reaching 47% in Q1 2024. Better targeting and more successful marketing techniques are reflected in this development.\u00a0This\u00a0allows the business to sign up new members for less money. The company has a solid strategy for developing its brand. Hence, this\u00a0has been effective and centered on connecting with customers at different culturally significant times and early in their health journeys.\n\nLooking forward, Hims & Hers has given upbeat predictions for the balance of 2024. The business projects $292 million to $297 million in sales for Q2, with $30 million to $35 million in adjusted EBITDA. Similarly, the top-line may range from $1.2 billion to $1.23 billion in 2024, while adjusted EBITDA will fall between $120 million and $135 million.\n\nIn short, these estimates further support the company\u2019s excellent financial standing and growth leads.\u00a0As a result, this shows ongoing\u00a0robust\u00a0growth and enhanced profitability.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo.

The corporation achieved leverage on corporate overhead expenditures and concluded the quarter with a staff below its cap of 12K employees. Block has kept up its growth momentum by taking these steps and improving its cost structure.\n\nAdditionally, Block intends to invest in high-yield fields like marketing and sales to propel further expansion. These efforts will increase market penetration overall, user acquisition, and brand visibility. In light of the solid Q1 results,\u00a0Block has increased its gross profit and profitability outlook for 2024. The company has upbeat forecasts for the remainder of 2024.\n\nAt the bottom line, a gross profit of at least\u00a0$8.78 billion, or a 17% YOY increase, is included in the revised guidance. A minimum of $1.3 billion adjusted operating income, or 15% of total profit, is required. Overall, the company\u2019s mark in maintaining its growth trajectory and attaining increased profitability is reflected in these predictions.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in SOFI, AMD, NVDA, INTC and\u00a0ACMR.

        "content": "Sometimes, you need a big score to turn the game around and that\u2019s the case here with small-cap stocks with upside potential. Ordinarily, it\u2019s better to acquire shares of large-capitalization companies. These entities typically have established businesses, translating to predictable revenue and earnings.\n\nOn the other hand, we have the small caps. First off, a lot of these entities don\u2019t even have earnings. Instead, they\u2019re focused on business expansion, hoping to build the bottom line later. Second, they tend to be volatile. Maybe they\u2019ll make it big or maybe they\u2019ll fold. It\u2019s this uncertainty that makes these company shares so darn cheap.\n\nAt the same time, this lack of predictability means that should the stars align, the upswing could be tremendous. On that note, below are small-cap stocks with upside potential to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Fremont, California, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) falls under the semiconductor equipment and materials sector. Per its public profile, ACM develops, manufactures and sells single-wafer wet cleaning equipment. This specialized product category enables enhancement of the manufacturing process and increases yield for integrated chips worldwide.\n\nLast year, the global wafer cleaning equipment market reached a valuation of $4.23 billion. By 2030, the sector could expand to $5.77 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%. Financially, ACM has been hitting out of the park, with an average positive earnings surprise of 144.53%.\n\nIn the trailing 12 months, the company posted net income of $87.64 million on revenue of $635.66 million. At the moment, the quarterly revenue growth rate (YOY) stands at 105%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts believe earnings per share could rise to $1.74 on sales of $698.81 million. That comes out to 6.75% growth in the bottom line from last year, whereas the top line would see 25.3% growth. At this rate, it\u2019s one of the small-cap stocks with upside potential.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in College Park, Maryland, IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) operates in the computer hardware sector. Per its corporate profile, IonQ develops general-purpose quantum computing systems. Specifically, it sells access to quantum computers of various qubit capacities. The projected market is massive, with some experts calling for a sector size of $6.5 billion by 2028. That would come out to a CAGR of 48.1% from 2023.\n\nWhat\u2019s especially enticing about IONQ is that we\u2019re very much in the early innings. At some point down the line, the quantum platform could be the new standard, yielding explosive gains in productivity. Therefore, acquiring IONQ now \u2013 when it only has a market cap of less than $2 billion \u2013 seems quite tempting.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a TTM basis, IonQ incurred a net loss of $170 million on revenue of $25.34 million. While diminutive, the quarterly revenue growth rate currently stands at 76.9%. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate that the top line could rise to $39.47 million. If so, that would imply 79.1% growth. In fiscal 2025, revenue could reach $82.38 billion. Thus, IONQ is one of the small-cap stocks with upside potential.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Midland, Texas, AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) falls under the communication equipment category. Along with its subsidiaries, AST develops and provides access to space-based cellular broadband networks for smartphones. Notably, its namesake platform provides broadband services to users who are out of terrestrial cellular coverage. It\u2019s one of the more exciting names within the burgeoning space economy.\n\nTo be sure, AST presents high risks. For example, from the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average bottom-line surprise came out to 9.48% below breakeven. Over the past 12 months, AST\u2019s net loss landed at $90.97 million on revenue of only $500,000. On paper, that doesn\u2019t sound good at all, especially since shares trade at a whopping 877X trailing-year sales.\n\nNevertheless, some patience could go a long way. In fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate a loss per share of 76 cents, a big improvement over last year\u2019s loss of $1.07. Moreover, sales could skyrocket to $55.23 million, with a blue-sky target of $113 million. In fiscal 2025, the top line could rise again to $253.88 million. For the adventurous, it\u2019s one of the small-cap stocks with upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Institutional investors in ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) lost 5.2% last week but have reaped the benefits of longer-term growth",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies ACM Research's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 17 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Insiders own 13% of ACM Research\n\nIf you want to know who really controls ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 54% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nLosing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 5.2% last week. However, the 145% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. But they would probably be wary of future losses.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of ACM Research.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ACM Research  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ACM Research?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nACM Research already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of ACM Research, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. ACM Research is not owned by hedge funds. The company's CEO Hui Wang is the largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.4%.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of ACM Research\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of ACM Research, Inc.. Insiders own US$184m worth of shares in the US$1.4b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in ACM Research. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPrivate Equity Ownership\n\nWith a stake of 11%, private equity firms could influence the ACM Research board. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - ACM Research has  3 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Are you on the lookout for investment opportunities that could potentially yield substantial returns? If so, cheap mid-cap stocks often represent an untapped gold mine for discerning investors.\n\nThese companies, typically valued between $2 billion and $10 billion, offer a unique blend of growth potential and affordability. This makes them ideal for investors seeking to build long-term wealth in the stock market. Mid-cap stocks often have more room to expand and innovate than their larger counterparts. For those willing to do the research and embrace a bit of risk, investing in undervalued mid-cap companies can lead to exceptional returns over time.\n\nNow, here are the top cheap mid-cap stocks to buy to put you on the path to riches!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) A series of roads and overpasses connect in an aerial view.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a leading infrastructure provider in the United States specializing in transportation, civil construction and e-infrastructure solutions. The company\u2019s robust backlog and diversified project portfolio make it well-positioned for continued growth in 2024.\n\nSterling Infrastructure is not a well known company on the stock market yet, but that will slowly be changing. They have been around for decades now but have largely remained unprofitable. After delivering record earnings results in the 2023 fiscal year, management has reiterated strong guidance for 2024. Their backlog is growing exponentially, as demand for infrastructure solutions remains robust.\n\nIn Sterling\u2019s recent Q1 FY24 results, revenue increased 9% year-over-year (YOY) to $440 million. Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 56% to $1.00 per share, while generating $50 million in cash flow from operations. Moreover, their backlog hit a record $2.35 billion on strong demand in the data center and aviation markets. With strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024, STRL stock remains one of the top cheap mid-cap stocks to buy now.\n\nScience Applications International (SAIC) communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earth\n\nSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nScience Applications International (NASDAQ:SAIC) is undoubtedly one of the best cheap mid-cap stocks to buy in 2024. After delivering strong FY24 financial results in March, management\u2019s updated FY25 guidance reflects higher revenue and free cash flow (FCF) generation.\n\nScience Applications International is not a company that you typically hear about on Wall Street. However, SAIC has seen considerable growth in revenue and EPS growth with the stock far outpacing the S&P 500. Over the last decade, SAIC stock returned 334% to shareholders compared to the benchmark index\u2019s 238%. The company specializes in a diverse range of software solutions for the intelligence community, from mission support analytics to cybersecurity solutions. In FY24, revenue decreased 3% YOY to $7.4 billion. However, EPS increased by 65% YOY to $8.88 per share. Their backlog at the end of fiscal 2024 was $22.8 billion, of which $3.5 billion was funded. This positions them for continued growth through the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR), a leading provider of semiconductor cleaning equipment is essential for the manufacturing of advanced semiconductor chips. With the global semiconductor industry experiencing rapid growth due to increasing demand for electronic devices and AI, ACM Research is poised to benefit significantly.\n\nThere are many positive tailwinds to suggest rapid growth will continue in the 2024 fiscal year. Mainly the rebound in the semiconductor equipment market, but also due to increased demand for AI applications.\n\nACM Research has barely hit its stride and its advanced technology for the efficient cleaning of semiconductor wafers remains robust. After reporting record earnings results in FY23, things are already looking rosy in 2024. In their latest Q1 FY24 results, revenue more than doubled YOY to $152 million. EPS also skyrocketed 136% YOY to 26 cents per share. Total shipments in the first quarter were up 175%, driven by an expansion in their product offerings. With a strong outlook for the 2024 fiscal year, ACMR stock is set to continue benefiting from the positive growth tailwinds of the semiconductor industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price.

An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the six recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ACMR Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ACMR\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ACM Research here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ACM Research, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ACMR Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for ACM Research, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $1.62.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ACM Research. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for ACM Research.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Finding untapped opportunities in the volatile world of stock trading may lead to substantial financial advantages. Three businesses stand out in the crowded market as attractive investments for those looking for unrealized potential. These businesses are noteworthy for their unique advantages and astute moves, making them appealing options for investors seeking to expand their holdings.\n\nThe first\u00a0one\u00a0stands out for having\u00a0an amazing\u00a0revenue growth rate of over 100%. This demonstrates its skill at gaining market share and broadening its range of products.\u00a0The second one, however, uses its niche market.\u00a0This\u00a0substantially contributes to company revenue and demonstrates its capacity to precisely and effectively serve niche markets. By increasing its capacity to meet rising demand, the firm strengthens its position and demonstrates a proactive commitment to seizing market possibilities.\n\nLastly, the third has a strong performance and a favorable growth prognosis. With the anticipated double-digit revenue growth, the firm\u2019s management has expressed confidence in its capacity to maintain momentum and capitalize on developing industry trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) had a massive 105% increase in sales over Q1 2023. This expansion demonstrates the company\u2019s fundamental capacity to gain market share and increase its clientele. The company\u2019s income sources\u00a0are spread\u00a0among several product areas, such as advanced packaging, single-wafer cleaning, and other technologies.\u00a0Indeed, this diversity improves overall revenue stability by lowering reliance on any\u00a0one\u00a0product sector.\n\nAdditionally, despite minor changes, ACM Research exceeded the projected range of\u00a040% to 45% by maintaining a gross margin of 52.5% in the first quarter of 2024, suggesting effective pricing and cost-control techniques. ACM Research\u2019s operating margin was 26.2%, a considerable increase from 14.7% during the same time last year. Indeed, this expansion demonstrates the company\u2019s capacity to convert sales growth into increased profitability.\n\nMoreover, ACM Research claims to support\u00a0around 90% of all cleaning process SAPS for memory and logic devices, making it the most complete cleaning portfolio in the market. Finally, the technological qualities of the company\u2019s main products, such as the Tahoe and TEBO single-wafer cleaning solutions, are unrivaled by rivals.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited Microelectronics (UMC) Semiconductors chips and blurred UMC United Microelectronics Corporation logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio via shutterstock\n\nUnited Microelectronics\u2019 (NYSE:UMC) specialist division generated 57% of total sales in Q1 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0was fueled\u00a0by the need for silicon interposers for AI servers, radio-frequency silicon-on-insulator chips, and power management ICs. Thus, this diversity shows that United Microelectronics can serve niche markets and is less reliant on a single product line.\n\nMoreover, United Microelectronics has demonstrated its focus on advancement and flexibility.\u00a0This\u00a0is done by responding to emerging industry trends by concentrating on major pipeline projects. These include tailored solutions and new technology platforms for high-growth categories, including 5G, artificial intelligence of things, and automotive industries.\n\nAdditionally, in Q1, United Microelectronics saw a rise in its 12-inch equivalent capacity, hitting 1.2 million. UMC\u2019s deliberate investment in capacity to satisfy rising demand and seize market opportunities\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in this growth. CapEx for United Microelectronics in 2024 amounted to around NT$3.3 billion,\u00a0mostly\u00a0for the growth of its 12-inch capacity. Therefore, this steady investment approach supports future development plans and\u00a0guarantees the continuation of capacity expansion activities.\n\nCeragon (CRNT) Illustrative Editorial of Ceragon Networks Ltd website homepage. Ceragon Networks Ltd (CRNT) logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nCeragon (NASDAQ:CRNT) delivered\u00a0a non-GAAP\u00a0net income of $4.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in Q1 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0is a solid boost against $3.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in Q1 2023. Fundamentally, valuation gains come from increased profits per share as Ceragon\u2019s top and bottom lines expand.\n\nMoreover, with inventories down from $68.8 million in December 2023 to $61 million at the end of Q1, Ceragon could retain a cash position of\u00a0$28.8 million. The solid cash position guarantees flexibility and stability in the company\u2019s upcoming operations and investments. The decrease in inventory levels is a result of sharp inventory management techniques. Hence, they maximized the working capital edge and matched inventory levels to variations in demand.\n\nFurther, Ceragon restated its forecast for 2024, estimating a top-line of $385 million to $405 million, or an 11% to 17% boost from 2023. Management has a solid stance on Ceragon\u2019s fundamental capacity to maintain pace and edge on market demand. The outlook reaffirmation demonstrates this. Overall, together with operating margin targets of\u00a0at least 10%, the anticipated rise in sales demonstrates Ceragon\u2019s focus on promoting top-line and bottom-line growth.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in ACMR.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -18.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, which ACM Research falls in, has lost 16.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -0.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 indicates a change of +38.9% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ACM Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ACMR _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate of $164.08 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.5%. The $698.4 million and $884.31 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +25.2% and +26.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $152.19 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.9%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.15 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.79%. The EPS surprise was +67.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Three exceptional IT businesses offer investors attractive opportunities due to their strategic orientation and exceptional performance with solid fundamentals. With a\u00a0substantial\u00a0increase in revenue, the first one has accelerated. This outstanding result highlights the company\u2019s skill at gaining market share and profitably monetizing its products, indicating a promising future growth trajectory.\n\nMeanwhile, the second one has seen a considerable boost in revenue in the semiconductor business. This lead has\u00a0been driven\u00a0by its diverse product portfolio. It serves several semiconductor industry areas and has established the firm as a\u00a0major\u00a0player with excellent growth prospects.\n\nFinally, the third has demonstrated remarkable financial strength and has a gross profit fueled by its\u00a0main\u00a0business. Furthermore, the company\u2019s development potential in the rapidly developing cryptocurrency environment has\u00a0been reinforced\u00a0by its strategic emphasis on Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and cryptocurrencies.\u00a0This\u00a0is supported by effective resource allocation and a dedication to innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOverall, these are not random possibilities; they result from each company\u2019s strategic goals, market flexibility and creative problem-solving.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the second quarter, Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) demonstrated a robust sales growth of 19% year-over-year (YoY), reaching $2 billion. This steady growth, from $1.7 billion in total sales for Q2 2023, is a testament to Palo Alto\u2019s ability to consistently capture market share and effectively monetize its offerings, reflecting solid top-line growth.\n\nMoreover, the\u00a0full\u00a0value growth of Palo Alto\u2019s future revenue is reflected in the Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) growth, which\u00a0has increased by 22% YoY to $10.8 billion. Strong demand for Palo Alto\u2019s products indicates this RPO boost and a robust pipeline of potential future income streams. Hence, the company can win long-term client commitments and contracts.\n\nFinally, the income earned from client invoices was reflected in the\u00a016% growth in billings YoY. Since the spike in billings is marginally slower than the revenue growth, there may be variations in billing cycles or revenue recognition techniques. Despite the stable bill increase, Palo Alto\u2019s capacity to propel sales momentum\u00a0is confirmed, staying in line with the trend of total top-line growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research\u2018s (NASDAQ:ACMR) fourth quarter sales were $170 million, a considerable 57% increase YoY. In comparison, the company\u2019s sales for 2023 were $558 million, signaling a solid 43% YoY increase.\n\nAdditionally, one of ACM Research\u2019s main advantages that propel its quick growth is its stable top-line growth.\u00a0Indeed, strong market demand for the company\u2019s offerings indicates this increase.\u00a0This\u00a0also reflects the company\u2019s successful market placement and happy customers. Thus, the capacity to steadily raise income indicates the market relevance and future growth prospects of ACM Research.\n\nIn 2023, sales of semi-critical cleaning products, Tahoe and single wafer cleaning climbed by 48%, accounting for 72% of revenue. There was a 33% YoY growth in sales from electrochemical plating (ECP) furnaces and other technologies, accounting for about 19% of the overall top line.\n\nFinally, except\u00a0for ECP\u00a0services and parts, revenue from advanced packaging increased by\u00a031.5% YoY in 2023 to make up 9% of overall revenue. ACM Research has a diverse product line. It targets several semiconductor industry areas. Therefore, the solid revenue increase observed in all product categories suggests that ACM Research\u2019s solutions are in high demand.\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock\u2018s (NYSE:SQ) potential for considerable expansion derives from its solid performance and stable growth across\u00a0key\u00a0measures. There was an adjusted EBITDA of $705 million in Q1 2024, nearly 3x from Q1 2023. Similarly, there was a gross profit of $2.09 billion, up 22% YoY. Comparably, adjusted operating income increased seven times from the previous year to $364 million.\n\nMoreover, Cash App\u2019s gross profit increased by 25% to $1.26 billion in segments, while Square\u2019s gross profit increased by\u00a019% to $820 million.\u00a0Indeed, the company can produce considerable profits and revenues, as indicated by this expansion.\u00a0This\u00a0is fueled\u00a0by the success of its\u00a0main\u00a0companies, Cash App and Square.\n\nFurther, one of the main factors boosting Block\u2019s growth potential is its strategic concentration on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The focus derives from its conviction in the possibility of an open system for money. With just 0.7% of associated costs, Cash App\u2019s bitcoin goods contributed 3.3% and 4.2% of Block\u2019s gross profit in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\nOverall, this demonstrates Block\u2019s effectiveness and financial impact on bitcoin-related projects, emphasizing the company\u2019s capacity to profit from cryptocurrencies\u2019 rising acceptance and popularity.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in ACMR.

        "content": "The stock market continues to question whether a large cap dominance \u2014 especially that from The Magnificent Seven \u2014 is indeed the best way to invest. While investing in large cap firms is undoubtedly a good strategy, there are plenty of top Russell 2000 stocks to buy. Enter the Russell 2000, 2000 small cap equities in the U.S. market.\n\nSmaller companies have a greater potential to grow rapidly than do their larger counterparts. It\u2019s easier to double revenue early on and becomes increasingly harder as time passes. Beyond that, many investors fear over concentration by investors among the largest equities. It follows then that such investors would logically consider all of the other firms that contribute to the economic engine of the United States. Lets evaluate the top Russell 2000 stocks to buy for ambitious investors.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) sells wet cleaning equipment used in the manufacturing of integrated circuit semiconductors. The stock represents an excellent small-cap opportunity in the chip packaging sector that should not be overlooked.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors will better recognize the opportunity when they understand the company\u2019s most recent preliminary results. ACM Research anticipates that revenues will fall between $150 million and $152 million in the first quarter of 2024. That will represent growth between 102% and 105%.\n\nACM Research is the fastest growing small cap chip stocks available. The company has seen its share price more than double over the past 12 months. Investors should also recognize that the chip packaging sector is expected to grow by double digits on a compounding annual basis between 2024 and 2029. Thus, ACMR represents a firm that has already hit its stride in a sector that should continue to grow. It is certainly one of the better small cap semiconductor plays available to investors at the moment.\n\nBellRing Brands (BRBR) A picture of the Clean Whey Protein Bar flavoured vanilla coconut crunch.\n\nSource: JJava Designs / Shutterstock.com\n\nBellRing Brands (NYSE:BRBR) is a fast growing beverage stock deserving of more attention. The company sells ready-to-drink protein shakes under the Premier brand along with protein powders under its Dymatize brand.\n\nDuring the first quarter sales grew by 18.7%, reaching $430.4 million. One of the more encouraging aspects about the company is that its growth was almost exclusively driven by volume gains and not inflation.\n\nThe company also increased guidance upon releasing that earnings report. I find BellRing Brands particularly interesting because I\u2019m continuously intrigued by fast-growing brands that hit on lifestyle trends. The protein market is expected to grow at a rate between 8% and 9% annually between 2023 and 2032. As consumers continue to avoid carbohydrates in preference of protein, companies like BellRing Brands have a real opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have seen similar stocks including Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) explode of late. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if BellRing Brands can grow similarly.\n\nMind Medicine (MNMD) Dried psilocybe cubensis psilocybin magic mushrooms inside and around a plastic prescription medicine bottle with no lid isolated on white background, Mind Medicine is in the psychedelic medicine business. MNMD stock\n\nSource: Daniel Patrick Martin / Shutterstock.com\n\nMind Medicine (NASDAQ:MNMD) is a psychedelic stock that continues to impress and inspire optimism among investors. Share prices have risen from $4 to $10 in 2024, and are expected to triple from current levels, which will no doubt attract some investors.\n\nThe company is poised for success in relation to the treatment of anxiety with LSD based therapeutics. The FDA granted breakthrough designation to Mind Medicine\u2019s MM120 program for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In trials, a single dose resulted in a substantial clinically relevant decrease in anxiety with a duration of 12 weeks.\n\nThe company intends to bring its LSD based treatment program to Phase 3 trials this year. It is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is growing rapidly accepting of alternative therapies that would have been considered outlandish years ago. Many companies are now leveraging the therapeutic benefits of drugs such as ketamine and LSD in the treatment of mental health disorders. It is truly the dawning of a new age in that regard, and Mind Medicine may very well emerge as one of the strongest stocks therefrom.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 8, 2024\n\nACM Research, Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ACM Research First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speakers today, Steve Pelayo, Managing Director of The Blueshirt Group. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Pelayo: Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss first quarter 2024 results, which we released before the U.S. market opened today. The release is available on our website, as well as from Newswire services. There is also a supplemental slide deck posted to the investors section of our website that we will reference during our prepared remarks.

For our GAAP results and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP amounts, you should refer to our earnings release, which is posted on the IR section of our website and to Slide 12.\n\nLet me now turn the call over to David Wang, who will begin with Slide 3. David?\n\nDavid Wang: Thanks, Steven. Hello, everyone and welcome to ACM Research the first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Please turn to Slide 3. I'm pleased with our results, solid start to the year for the first quarter. Revenue was $152.2 million, up 105.0% profitability was good and gross margin of 52.5% and operating margin of 26.2%, and we ended the quarter with just over $288 million of cash and time deposits. Shipments for the first quarter were $245 million, up 175%. As expected, first quarter shipments were higher due to delivery of our finished goods that were not shipped in the fourth quarter of last year. And we also had an exclusion from our production team during the Lunar New Year holiday period. I will now provide the detail on products.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease turn to Slide 4. Revenue from the single wafer cleaning Tahoe and a semi-critical cleaning product grow 199% in Q1 and represent 72% of the total revenue. ACM offers what we believe is the industry's most comprehensive cleaning portfolio. We support nearly 90% of all cleaning process SAPS for memory and logic devices. At the high end, we believe our flagship SAPS Tahoe and TEBO single wafer cleaning products deliver technical feature not available from any of our competitors. At the lower end, our semi critical tools including auto bench have trading incremental growth for our cleaning category over the past two years. We have recently made progress in SPM market which we believe was resulting sheer gain and growth in our cleaning business starting this year.\n\nLet me provide more detail. SPM stands for sulfuric acid peroxide mixing. These SAPS are normally used to clean wafer after photoresist removal process and post CMP cleaning. We estimate the total available market for the SAM of our SPM tool is 25% to 30% of the total front-end cleaning market. Today, SPM has been a small contribution to our business. Our SPM tools including, Tahoe, low temperature single wafer SPM and now our high temperature single wafer SPM tools. Here now we believe there had been only one major supplier of high temperature single wafer SPM tools. Our engineering team has recently made their greater technical progress with our high temperature tool and we believe ACM can now participate as an alternative supplier. This is especially important as we believe our customers generally prefer One Stop Shop for all their SPM cleaning SAPS s.\n\nWith the high temperature SPM tool, we believe ACM now has a full product line to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. Additionally, Tahoe has been qualified for production by multiple customers and is beginning a ramping space with a substantial number of orders planned for delivery in 2024. The enhancements have been made to this performance allowing the tool to match particularly more efficiency comparable to the single wafer process, while reducing sulfuric usage by 50% to 70%. We now expect a meaningful ramp of SPM tools this year as we begin volume delivery across the number of key customers. Finish up on cleaning, we also expect our bevel etcher cleaning tool to contribute meaningful revenue in 2024 and we are on track to complete evaluation of a single critical CO2 dry cleaning tool this year for revenue in 2025.\n\nRevenue from ECP furnace and other technology declined 3% in Q1 and represent a 70% of the total revenue. As mentioned last quarter, we hit an important milestone for this category in 2023 with more than $100 million in revenue. The year-over-year revenue decline is primarily due to quarterly fluctuations. In fact, we shipped 3x more ECP tools in Q1 \u201824 versus the same period last year. And we expect the revenue growth for this category for the full year. As noted the in the prior calls, we believe the furnace product cycle is perhaps a year and so behind ECP. We have a brand - broader footprint of customer activities with more than a handful first tool currently under evaluation and multiple customers. We are optimistic this will be resulting qualification and follow-on orders in the coming quarters.\n\nRevenue from advanced packaging which, exclude ECP, but including service and spare parts grew 53.2% in Q1 and represent 11% of the total revenue. This category including a range of packaging tools such as the coder, developer, scrubber, PR stripper and wet etchers and also service and spare parts. And we continue to explore new products and technology to participate in the next-generation of advanced packaging and we believe ACM is one of the only company that offer full set of wet tool, have a polishing tool and copper plating tool for advanced packaging. In Q1, we delivered our ULTRA C v Vacuum Cleaning Tool for major customers to me that the flux removal require requirement for chiplets and other advanced 3D packaging structures. Today we also introduced the Frame Wafer Cleaning Tool. Close-up of a worker wearing protective gear inspecting a silicon wafer in a laboratory.\n\nThis tool is designed for post post-debonding wafer cleaning that enable nearly 100% recycle solvent and attrition [Ph]. We have a successfully completed the installation and the qualification of first tool with a key customer. Finishing up on product, we are making good progress with our Track and PECVD platform. We believe our advisory technology producing both tools for success for Mainland China and also global customers. We are engaged with multiple customers that we expect there is substantial growth progress in product development and evaluation this year with revenue in 2025 and beyond. Now move on to our customer, please turn to Slide 7. In China, we believe we have a leading position in cleaning. We have become a multiple product company with a competitive product in a market for plating and furnace.\n\nAnd we have a solid evaluation pipeline for Track and PECVD. Ourselves and the service team are now driving deeper adoption of our products across our customer base. Our growth is also being driven by new entrants. On the international front, we plan to deliver ULTRA C v backside cleaning and a bevel etcher tool in the second quarter of 2024 to a large US manufacturer that qualify as the first SAP cleaning tool for revenue last year. This demonstrates a deepening relationship which we believe can lead to production orders across multiple product lines. Moreover, ACM brand and the reputation are gaining recognition among other US chip makers with new engagement and the potential opportunity to penetrate their global manufacturer sites. We recently hired additional seasonal marketing and sales professionals who bring establishing their relationship with key US semiconductor players.\n\nIn Europe, we install our first ever evaluation tool, the ULTRA C SAPS V cleaning tool at a major global semiconductor manufacturer in the fourth quarter last year. The initial feedback has been positive and we are optimistic that the volume production order possible by middle of the year. We think Korea we see opportunity with SK Hynix, high bandwidth memory HDM product. We see potential gains with our SAPS cleaning tool for high aspirational vehicles as well as ultra ECP for TSV applications. To support growth, we made a progress in our facility expending in China and other regions. Please turn to Slide 8. In China, construction of our Lingang production R&D center is nearly complete. We expect the production later this year. In Korea, we are making progress with key customers, we believe a strong commitment to Korea can improve our relationship with key Korean customers.\n\nOur resource in Korea can also provide another basis to supporting international customer in the US, Europe and other parts of Asia. We recently hired a new leader to run our Korea operations, David Kim. He is a long-time veteran of SK Hynix, we are optimistic his experience and relationship will help adoption our technology and accelerate our business in the region. We continue to invest in our Oregon site to add to our service, support and demonstration capability for R&D and customer activity in the US and Europe. I would now provide our outlook. Please turn to Slide 9. We believe WFE spending in China will remain solid as the country continues on its goal to match its production capacity with the end-market consumption. We are focused on gaining market share in China, new product introduction and expanding our business to new customers in the USA, Korea, Europe and other Asia markets.\n\nWe are reaffirming our 2024 revenue outlook to be in the range of $650 to $725 million. This implies \u201823 year-over-year growth at the middle point, we expect that our full year revenue growth for 2024 to outpace both the China and global WFE growing rates. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO Mark, will review details of our first quarter results? Mark please.\n\nMark McKechnie : Thank you, David, and good day, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11. Unless I note otherwise I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes stock-based compensation and unrealized gain and loss on short-term investments. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures comparable to GAAP measures is included in our earnings release. Unless otherwise noted, the following figures refer to the first quarter of 2024 and comparisons are with the first quarter of 2023. I will now provide financial highlights for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was $152.2 million for the first quarter, up 105%. Revenue for single wafer cleaning Tahoe and semi-critical cleaning was $109.5 million, up 199%. Revenue for ECP, furnace and other technologies was $25.8 million, down 3%.\n\nAs David noted, we anticipate good growth for the full year 2024 in this category. Revenue for advanced packaging, excluding ECP services and spares was $16.9 million, up $53.2%. Total shipments were $245 million for the first quarter, up 175%. Gross margin was 52.5% versus 54%. This exceeded our normal expected range of 40% to 45%. For the full year, we now expect gross margins to fall in the upper end of our target range. We do continue to expect gross margin to vary from period-to-period due to a variety of factors such as sales volumes, product mix and currency impacts. Operating expenses were $40.1 million for the first quarter, up from $29.2 million. R&D was $19.4 million versus $13.3 million. The year-over-year increase reflects additional personnel and other expenses to support our product development pipeline, the decline versus Q4 \u201923 was primarily due to reduced spending on internal R&D development tools.\n\nSales and marketing was $11.1 million versus $8.9 million and G&A was $9.5 million versus $6.9 million. For 2024, we plan for R&D expenses in the 13% to 15% range. Sales and marketing in the 7% to 8% percent range and G&A in the 5% to 6% range. Operating income was $39.8 million for the first quarter, up from $10.9 million. Operating margin was 26.2%, up from 14.7%. We recorded a realized gain of $0.3 million for the first quarter from the sale of short-term investments. Recall that realized gains are included in non-GAAP earnings. Income tax expense was $4.4 million for the first quarter versus $2.9 million. For the full year, we plan for an effective tax rate on non-GAAP pre-tax income in the 15% to 20% range. Net income attributable to ACM Research was $34.6 million for the first quarter, up from $9.9 million.\n\nNet income per diluted share was 52 point - sorry net income per diluted share was $0.52 for the first quarter versus $0.15. Our non-GAAP net income excludes $14.6 million or $0.22 per share in stock-based compensation expense. This reflects a full quarter impact of the significant grant of ACM Shanghai shares made in the third quarter of last year, in addition to our normal ACM Research grants. This was the first major grant by our subsidiary since the 2021 star market IPO. Our management team considers the grant as a critical differentiator to attract new talent for new product development and to retain key employees. I will now review selected balance sheet items. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and time deposits were $288.3 million versus $304.5 million at the end of the last quarter.\n\nTotal inventory was $581.1 million versus $545.4 million at the end of last quarter. This includes raw materials and work in progress which totals $318.2 million and finished goods inventory of $262.9 million. Finished goods inventory mainly includes first tools and evaluation tools at our customers and also includes finished goods at ACM\u2019s facilities. Capital expenditures were $25.4 million. Or the full year, we expect to spend about $100 million in capital expenditures. This primarily includes continued investments in our Lingang facilities remodeling for our new headquarters for ACM Shanghai and our investments in Korea and the US and some fixed asset expenditures. That concludes our prepared remarks.

        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.31 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 67.74%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.43, delivering a surprise of 330%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nACM Research , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, posted revenues of $152.19 million for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.79%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $74.26 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nACM Research shares have added about 39.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for ACM Research?\n\nWhile ACM Research has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for ACM Research: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.37 on $164.29 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.62 on $698.97 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Sohu.com (SOHU), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 20.\n\nThis operator of a popular Chinese Web portal is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nSohu.com's revenues are expected to be $177.03 million, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "ACM Research, Inc.\n\nFREMONT, Calif., May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACM Research, Inc. (\u201cACM\u201d) (NASDAQ: ACMR), a leading supplier of wafer processing solutions for semiconductor and advanced wafer-level packaging applications, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\u201cI am pleased with our first quarter results, a solid start for 2024. We delivered 105% revenue growth, record shipments, and strong profitability,\" said ACM\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. David Wang. \u201cOur results demonstrate continued spending on mature nodes by our mainland China customers, contribution from new products, and market share gains at both existing and new customers.\u201d\n\nDr. Wang continued, \u201cWe anticipate growth for 2024 as a result of our broadening product portfolio and expanding global footprint. We expect additional market share gains in cleaning with increased customer traction for Tahoe, single wafer high temperature SPM, and supercritical CO2 dry products, continued strength in ECP, and accelerating customer adoption for our furnace products. We expect to begin initial production at our facility in Lingang, Shanghai this year, and we continue to invest in our U.S. and Korea operations to support the global market opportunity.\u201d\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, GAAP Non-GAAP(1) 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands, except EPS) Revenue $ 152,191 $ 74,256 $ 152,191 $ 74,256 Gross margin 52.0 % 53.8 % 52.5 % 54.0 % Income from operations $ 25,232 $ 8,862 $ 39,801 $ 10,930 Net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc. $ 17,433 $ 7,145 $ 34,597 $ 9,867 Basic EPS $ 0.28 $ 0.12 $ 0.56 $ 0.17 Diluted EPS $ 0.26 $ 0.11 $ 0.52 $ 0.15\n\n(1) Reconciliations to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) financial measures from non-GAAP financial measures are presented below under \u201cReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d Non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation and, with respect to net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc. and basic and diluted earnings per share, also exclude unrealized loss on short-term investments.\n\nOutlook\n\nACM is maintaining its revenue guidance range of $650 million to $725 million for fiscal year 2024. This expectation is based on ACM management\u2019s current assessment of the continuing impact from international trade policy, together with various expected spending scenarios of key customers, supply chain constraints, and the timing of acceptances for first tools under evaluation in the field, among other factors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Highlights and Recent Announcements\n\nShipments. Total shipments in the first quarter of 2024 were $245 million, up 175% from the first quarter of 2023. Total shipments include deliveries for revenue in the quarter and deliveries of first tool systems awaiting customer acceptance for potential revenue in future quarters. Expanded Advanced Packaging Portfolio with Introduction of Frame Wafer Cleaning Tool. We introduced our Frame Wafer Cleaning Tool for advanced packaging. The tool effectively cleans semiconductor wafers during the post-debonding cleaning process. The Frame Wafer Cleaning Tool also includes an innovative solvent reclamation system that provides environmental and cost benefits. We have also successfully completed the installation and qualification of the first tool with a major Chinese manufacturer.\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Summary\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following figures refer to the first quarter of 2024 and comparisons are with the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRevenue was $152.2 million, up 105.0%, reflecting higher sales of single wafer cleaning, Tahoe and semi-critical cleaning equipment and advanced packaging (excluding ECP), and services and spares. Gross margin was 52.0% versus 53.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 52.5% versus 54.0%. Gross margin exceeded ACM\u2019s long-term business model range of 40% to 45%. ACM expects gross margin to vary from period to period due to a variety of factors, such as product mix, currency impacts and sales volume. Operating expenses were $53.9 million, an increase of 73.1%. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 35.4% from 41.9%. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, were $40.1 million, up 37.4%. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 26.3% from 39.3%. Operating income was $25.2 million, up from $8.9 million. Operating margin was 16.6% versus 11.9%. Non-GAAP operating income, which excludes the effect of stock-based compensation, was $39.8 million, up from $10.9 million. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 26.2% versus 14.7%. Unrealized loss on short-term investments was $2.6 million. The loss reflects the change in market value of the investments by ACM\u2019s principal operating subsidiary, ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc., in short-term investments. The value is marked-to-market quarterly and is excluded in the non-GAAP financial metrics. Income tax expense was $4.4 million, compared to $2.9 million. Net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc. was $17.4 million, up from $7.1 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc., which excludes the effect of stock-based compensation and unrealized loss on short-term investments, was $34.6 million, up from $9.9 million. Net income per diluted share attributable to ACM Research, Inc. was $0.26, compared to $0.11. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which excludes the effect of stock-based compensation and unrealized loss on short-term investments, was $0.52, up from $0.15. Cash and cash equivalents, plus restricted cash and short-term and long-term time deposits were $288.3 million at March 31, 2024, versus $304.5 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nA conference call to discuss results will be held on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 p.m. China Time).

These supplemental measures exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, which ACM does not believe is indicative of its core operating results. In addition, non-GAAP net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc. and basic and diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and unrealized loss on short-term investments, which ACM also believes are not indicative of its core operating results. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under \u201cReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\n\nACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM to provide this non-GAAP information.\n\nWhile ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM\u2019s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "content": "The technology industry has been booming, especially over the last year. This is primarily due to the increased attention surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI) and similar technologies. The production of semiconductors is crucial to the development of innovative technologies.\n\nAlong with being vital to technological advancement, semiconductors are just as important to our everyday lives. They make our smartphones, cars and computers function.\n\nA few stocks within the semiconductor industry share impressive price appreciation and offer strong long-term growth potential. Let\u2019s explore some great options for investors seeking to gain exposure to this burgeoning industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) primarily sells cleaning equipment for integrated circuits. It also provides electrochemical plating and thermal deposition services.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has increased by 175%. That was primarily due to its most recent earnings results, which greatly exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nOn Feb. 28, ACM Research released its\u00a0Q4 earnings of full year 2023. It stated that total revenue increased by 57% to $170 million. And earnings per share more than doubled from nineteen cents per share to forty-three cents year-over-year (YOY).\n\nDirectly following this earnings report, ACMR\u2019s stock price increased by over 40% because it\u00a0beat analysts\u2019 predictions for revenue and earnings per share by a fair margin.\n\nACMR provided revenue estimates for the full year 2024 of between $650 million and $725 million. In addition, the total revenue for the full year 2023 was $558 million.\n\nRecently, the company released\u00a0preliminary unaudited revenue and shipment results\u00a0for the Q1 of 2024. It revealed that revenue and shipments are expected to increase by 103% to 105% and 163% to 165% YOY, respectively.\n\nTherefore, ACMR is a sturdy buy semiconductor company that draws in investors due to its healthy growth metrics.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a leading producer of semiconductor devices used in smartphones, high-performance computing and other electronics.\n\nOn Apr. 18, TSM reported\u00a0Q1 earnings of 2024. The total revenue increased by 17% and net income rose by 9%. And, it announced expected earnings for Q4 of 2024, with anticipated revenue between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also experiencing impressive share price appreciation. For example, within the last year, it has increased by 67%.\n\nMoreover, TSM has benefited due to the influx of investors\u2019 attention towards generative AI. The company offers\u00a0investors impressive growth capabilities. And it anticipates a strong growth rate over the next several years, particularly within its high computing and automotive segments.\n\nOffering solid growth metrics, TSM is the second largest company in the sector by market cap behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nImpinj (PI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip.

Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) uses its wide array of integrated circuit technology to provide a cloud connectivity platform. Its applications include industries such as retail, logistics, healthcare and industrials.\n\nOver the past year, Impinj\u2019s share price has increased by 73%, primarily due to a positive earnings report for the first quarter. This has investors rushing to buy shares.\n\nOn Apr. 24, PI dropped\u00a0earnings results for Q1 of 2024. That showed a net loss of $4 million for Q1 2023 was reported. And for Q1 2024, it increased to net income of $33 million. Total revenue decreased by 10% YOY. This year\u2019s second quarter outlook expects total revenue to range between $96 million and $99 million.\n\nDespite experiencing a decrease in total revenue YOY, Impinj still beat analysts\u2019 expectations for first quarter earnings. And that sent the stock price higher by nearly 30%.\n\nThus, Impinj is a strong semiconductor stock buy that investors should keep their eye on. With projected revenue for Q2 improving over Q1, expect share price appreciation.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "While conventional wisdom calls for selling securities, these best Nasdaq stocks may require a complete rethink. With the possibility that the Federal Reserve might get its soft landing after all, risk-on sentiment has returned on Wall Street.\n\nPreviously, the combination of consistently robust jobs reports and soaring energy prices meant that the central bank would likely have been forced to shift its policy. Rather than cutting interest rates, the Fed appeared to be on course to raise them. However, with the April employment picture coming in lower than expected, policymakers may have the flexibility to reduce rates as planned.\n\nIf so, now may be the time to be acquisitive. In that case, these are possibly the best Nasdaq stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Israel, CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) develops, markets and sells software-based identity security solutions and services in the U.S. and multiple international markets. It offers myriad relevancies, particularly in the area of endpoint access management and multi-factor authentication. Given the extraordinary damages that can stem from unauthorized access, this arena should see increased demand.\n\nOperationally, one of CyberArk\u2019s top attributes is its top-line expansion. Over the past three years, its revenue growth rate came in at 14.5%. That\u2019s above 64.25% of its peers. Further, its free cash flow (FCF) margin stands at 14.04%, ranked better than 82% of the competition.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering analysts are looking for earnings per share of $2. That\u2019s a big leap from last year\u2019s result of $1.12. Further, sales could land $934.21 million or 24.2% above 2023\u2019s tally of $751.89 million. In the following year, revenue could rise to $1.14 billion, up 22.4% from projected 2024 sales.\n\nWith the relevance and forecasted top-line growth, CYBR makes for one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Fremont, California, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) operates under the semiconductor equipment and materials category. Per its public profile, ACM develops, manufactures and distributes single-wafer wet cleaning equipment for enhancing the manufacturing process and yield for integrated chips worldwide. While it\u2019s not the most exciting tech player, it offers critical services that keep the ecosystem running smoothly.\n\nUnsurprisingly, ACM enjoys robust operational metrics. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 51.7%, above 94.37% of its peers. During the same period, its EBITDA growth rate hit a whopping 80%. Nevertheless, ACMR trades at only 17.15X forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 25.06X.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, for fiscal 2024, the high-side EPS target calls for $1.80. Last year, earnings reached $1.63 per share. However, the spotlight may be on the top line, with sales projected to hit $699.36 million on average. That\u2019s up 25.4% from last year\u2019s print of $557.72 million. Also, the blue-sky sales target calls for $731.35 million.\n\nWith ongoing relevancy forecasted, ACMR ranks among the best Nasdaq stocks to buy.\n\nRhythm Pharmaceuticals (RYTM) dollar sign written with pills spilled from a medicine bottle. millionaire maker drug stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHailing from Boston, Massachusetts, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RYTM) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on rare neuroendocrine diseases. It features multiple therapeutics in various stages of clinical trials focused on complex obesity-related conditions. Since the start of the year, shares lost about 3% of equity value. However, the bulls have been driving shares higher in recent sessions.\n\nOperationally, it\u2019s not the most remarkable enterprise. For example, its three-year EBITDA growth rate comes in at 1.1%. That\u2019s a bit off from the sector median value of 6%. However, it does command a strong balance sheet, with a cash-to-debt ratio of nearly 219X. In contrast, the sector median is only 6.54X.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for revenue to reach $131.61 million. If so, that would represent a gargantuan gain of 70% from last year\u2019s result of $77.43 million. Further, the blue-sky sales target is $137.78 million.\n\nBy the following year, consensus sales targets $206.2 million, with a high-side estimate of $298.46 million. While RYTM is speculative, if the stars align, it could be one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "ACM Research ACMR is set to report its first-quarter 2024 results on May 8.\r\n\r\nThe company has been benefiting from its multi-product portfolio and growing customer base. Its strengthening foothold across international markets like the United States, Europe and Korea, strong China localization trend, increasing mature node investment in China, and new product cycles have been driving top-line growth.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s strong market position across the semiconductor end market on the back of its differentiated technology is expected to have continued boosting its revenue growth during the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe growing demand for the company's chiplet designs, driven by the rising AI trend, is expected to have aided it in capitalizing on growth opportunities present in the booming advanced packaging market. Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the advanced packaging market is expected to hit $32.64 billion in 2024 and reach $45 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.6% during the forecast period of 2024-2029.\r\n\r\nThe increasing adoption of its flagship SAPS Tahoe and TEBO single-wafer cleaning products, driven by growing demand for single-wafer cleaning tools across various sectors, is expected to have bolstered the company\u2019s overall performance in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nStrengthening Electrochemical Plating (ECP), Furnace and other technologies segment on the back of its patented plating technologies like multi-zone anodes for superior uniformity control, rubber-seal plating chucks for superior sealing, and vacuum pre-wetting of wafers, is likely to have acted as a tailwind for the company in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across evaluation tools, including its Track and Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) platforms, is likely to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nContinuous recovery of shipment delays is expected to have positively impacted the total shipment growth during the quarter under review. For the first quarter, the company expects total shipments to be in the range of $235-$240 million, indicating year-over-year growth in the band of 163%-169%.\r\n\r\nHowever, the negative impacts of U.S.-China trade policies are expected to have been a major concern.\r\n\r\nFurther, changes in the spending patterns of key customers and supply-chain constraints are likely to have hurt top-line growth during the first quarter.\n\nACM Research, Inc.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned -13.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, to which ACM Research belongs, has lost 10.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.31 per share, indicating a change of +106.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -0.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 indicates a change of +38.9% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ACM Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ACMR _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $151 million indicates a year-over-year change of +103.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $698.97 million and $884.31 million estimates indicate +25.3% and +26.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $170.32 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.9%. EPS of $0.43 for the same period compares with $0.19 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.09 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +15.79%. The EPS surprise was +330%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have seen impressive growth over several years due to the growing need for semiconductors in everyday items. With the burgeoning tech industry, investors have given increased attention to innovative companies in the sector.\n\nAs new technological advancements occur, the need for semiconductors will only grow. It would be wise for investors, especially those\u00a0who are\u00a0building a retirement account, to gain exposure to\u00a0semiconductor stocks due to their high likelihood of compounding returns.\n\nBelow are a few options for semiconductor stocks that haven\u2019t garnered as much attention as the\u00a0main\u00a0stocks in the industry, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). However, they provide solid returns and\u00a0are great additions\u00a0to a retirement account.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a semiconductor equipment manufacturer that produces single-wafer cleaning products for\u00a0use on\u00a02D and 3D wafers using both a wet process and electrochemical plating.\n\nOn Feb. 28, ACM Research reported earnings for the\u00a0fourth quarter of\u00a0the full year\u00a02023, stating that total revenue increased by 57% and net income rose by 50% compared to the previous year. The company mentioned that increased operating margins, new product rollout, and a growing customer base help to improve its overall earnings potential. ACMR also handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations for revenue and earnings per share.\n\nACM Research has released\u00a0preliminary results for Q1 of 2024, with the full report expected release date being May 8. It stated that revenue year-over-year\u00a0is projected\u00a0to grow by 102% to 105%, and total shipments to increase by 163% to 169%.\n\nOver this past year, ACMR\u00a0has seen its share price increase\u00a0by 166%, mostly due to its fourth-quarter earnings, which propelled the stock price by over 40% directly following the announcement.\u00a0With first quarter 2024 results expected to be very strong\u00a0as well, all eyes should be on ACM Research regarding its growth prospects.\n\nImpinj (PI) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) operates a cloud platform that manufactures integrated circuits for software and algorithmic applications.\u00a0These circuits\u00a0are used\u00a0in\u00a0industries such as\u00a0retail, automotive, banking, aviation, and healthcare.\n\nIn March, Impinj received a sigh of relief from investors following the\u00a0outcome of patent litigation with NXP Semiconductor regarding RFID products.\u00a0This\u00a0was a multi-year dispute. Now, all legal proceedings in the matter are terminated.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Apr. 24, Impinj reported earnings for the\u00a0first quarter of 2024,\u00a0in which it stated that total revenue decreased by 11% and cash and cash equivalents increased by fourfold year-over-year. A net loss of $4 million was reported for the first quarter of 2023, and for Q1 2024, that increased to a net income of $33 million.\n\nPI also released its financial outlook for the second quarter of 2024, with expected revenue between $96 and $99 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter.\n\nImpinj is one of the solid semiconductor stocks that offers investors potential upside. Its share price surged following the reported first-quarter earnings for 2024, in which its share price nearly increased by 30%. With a strong Q2 projected, this may be\u00a0a great\u00a0opportunity to purchase a share of PI.\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor.

Its annual dividend is 1.58%, and the most recent quarterly dividend distribution was on Apr. 10, for one dollar and one cent per share.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter beat analyst predictions regarding earnings per share. The\u00a0outlook for the second quarter piqued investors\u2019 interest due to its increased projections of $3. 025 to $3.225 billion in total revenue, with analysts predicting $3.11 billion in sales.\n\nNXP Semiconductor is a large semiconductor company that can provide investors with stable share price appreciation.

        "title": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +106.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $151 million, up 103.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ACM Research?\n\nFor ACM Research, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ACM Research will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that ACM Research would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.43, delivering a surprise of +330%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nACM Research doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(ACMR).\n\nACM Research currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.14, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by seven brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.14 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the seven recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 14.3% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ACM Research here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ACM Research, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in ACMR?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ACM Research, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $1.62.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ACM Research. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for ACM Research.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Some stocks stand out among the vastness of the stock market as possible opportunities. Their growth derives from emerging trends and game-changing technology. These three millionaire-maker stocks each provide a unique opportunity that has the potential to transform portfolios and release riches.\n\nThe first is leading the way in expanding into foreign markets and demonstrating its ability to compete globally. The company\u2019s trajectory denotes expansion with certifications from top American manufacturers and prosperous European installations. Similarly, it reflects a calculated risk-taking move. This led to the company\u2019s hold on a considerable piece of the lucrative global semiconductor market.\n\nThe second, on the other hand, uses specialized products made for fast-growing industries, especially 5G and artificial intelligence (AIoT). Its capacity to adeptly handle market oscillations while emphasizing innovation establishes it as a pillar of resilience in the face of ambiguity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinally, the third one offers a tempting possibility due to its consistent growth in the business market. The company\u2019s revenue visibility improves, and its competitive edge is reinforced as revenue from business clients keeps rising.\n\nTop Millionaire-Maker Stocks: ACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, ACM Research\u2019s (NASDAQ:ACMR) sales of semi-critical cleaning products, Tahoe and single wafer cleaning, climbed by 48% annually, accounting for 72% of total sales. The substantial revenue contribution of single-wafer cleaning products to ACM Research\u2019s product line shows their significance.\n\nAdditionally, it has been successful in breaking into foreign markets.\u00a0This\u00a0is seen\u00a0in European installations and certifications from a major American manufacturer. Furthermore, these achievements show that ACM Research can compete worldwide as it has expanded outside its home market. Thus, ACM Research\u2019s 43% growth rate is based on the leading product range, ongoing expenditure, gaining market share with present clients, and expanding outreach to attract new clients in China.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between ACM Research\u2019s growth rate and its tactics for expanding market share demonstrates how well these tactics boost revenue growth. Thus, operating margins of 21% for the fourth quarter and 22% for the whole year were achieved, demonstrating a solid bottom line.\n\nOverall, the constancy of operating margins over the quarters and the year indicates ACM Research\u2019s capacity to control expenses while producing income efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited Microelectronics (UMC) Semiconductors chips and blurred UMC United Microelectronics Corporation logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio via shutterstock\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, United Microelectronics\u2019s (NYSE:UMC) specialist business accounted for 57% of total sales, driven by the need for silicon interposers for AI servers, power management ICs, and radio frequency silicon on insulator chips.\n\nMoreover, the vital top-line lead from the specialist business indicates United Microelectronics\u2019 ability to broaden its range of products and seize market share in rapidly\u00a0expanding industries, including 5G, AIoT, and automotive. United Microelectronics reduces market volatility risk by concentrating on specialized products and using new trends to spur expansion.\n\nAt the bottom line, United Microelectronics\u2019s gross margin performance indicates the company\u2019s effectiveness in controlling manufacturing costs and streamlining operational procedures. The business kept its\u00a030.9% gross margin in the first quarter of 2024, unchanged from the previous quarter. Nonetheless, the gross margin decreased from 35.5% in the prior year\u2019s first quarter.\n\nTo sum up, the gross margin\u2019s sequential stability shows that United Microelectronics can keep expenses under control and profitability high despite fluctuations in sales and market circumstances.\n\nPagerduty (PD) A concept image of a person holding a phone with various icons representing software-as-a-service companies. SaaS stocks.\n\nSource: TierneyMJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nPagerDuty (NYSE:PD) had a consistent upward trend in measures, including average deal size, $100,000 transaction volume, and expansion annual rate of return. The enterprise segment\u2019s annual recurring revenue (ARR) accounted for 62% of the overall ARR. This suggests a greater proportion of corporate clients. PagerDuty has demonstrated its capacity to serve larger and more complicated enterprises. This is reflected in the enterprise industry\u2019s consistent upward advancement and growth.\n\nIn addition to improving revenue visibility and predictability, PagerDuty\u2019s\u00a0larger\u00a0proportion of ARR from the enterprise segment fortifies its competitive posture in the market.\u00a0Moreover, PagerDuty has derived its capacity to achieve sustainable growth and optimize client lifetime value through constant customer expansion and outstanding retention numbers.\n\nAdditionally, the\u00a0Q4 increase of $13 million in net new ARR and the 10% increase in the overall ending ARR signifies PagerDuty\u2019s ability to attract new clients and grow its current clientele. Furthermore, the dollar-based net retention rate is 107%.\u00a0Therefore, this\u00a0exceeded projections and indicates PagerDuty\u2019s successful client relationship management and retention.\n\nOverall, this reflects a high level of customer satisfaction, a solid product-market fit, and the value that PagerDuty\u2019s products have among its clientele.

Over the past year, the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 has dominated the stock market, driving most of the gains. We\u2019re now seeing the market take a breather, but Mr. Market is still focused on the trajectory of the Mag 7s. With that in mind, are the top Russell 2000 stocks worth investing in?\n\nThe Russell 2000 index looks at the smallest 2000 companies in the Russell 3000, providing a bigger picture for U.S. small-cap stocks. Naturally, these stocks tend to be more volatile than their larger counterparts, which makes them more exciting for bold investors. Moreover, there\u2019s also the opportunity to make massive gains from a potential comeback story.\n\nTake a stock like\u00a0Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM), which boasted a market cap of $6.74 billion as of October 2013. Seven years later, though, the stock plummeted to $2.25 billion, shedding $4.50 billion from its market cap. However, its market cap is now upwards of $6.65 billion, which shows you the relevance of Russell 2000 stocks. With that said, let\u2019s look at the three high-potential Russell 2000 stocks to invest in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLiveRamp (RAMP) illustration the LiveRamp Holdings logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLiveRamp (NYSE:RAMP) is a frontrunner in omnichannel advertising, gaining incredible traction over the past few years. It offers a one-stop solution for its clients to effectively manage their marketing, analytics, and customer identity, emphasizing privacy and compliance.\n\nFor example, a company could use LiveRamp\u2019s platform to monitor customers browsing products on their website, then send them targeted ads on social media and offer personalized recommendations. Additionally, all customer data is managed securely throughout this process.\n\nLiveRamp has been growing at a healthy pace of late, beating top-and-bottom-line estimates in six out of the last seven quarters. Moreover, it has been making excellent progress in turning a profit again,\u00a0with an 88% improvement in its trailing twelve-month losses to negative $14 million. Also, its levered free cash flows have grown 54% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, 111% higher than the sector median.\n\nTiprank\u2019s analysts are incredibly upbeat about the stock, estimating\u00a0a 53% upside from current price levels.\n\nSkyWest (SKYW) A close-up shot of a SkyWest (SKYW) plane.\n\nSource: Heather Dunbar / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW) is a top regional airliner that has rebounded emphatically post-pandemic. Overcoming the obstacles posed during the Covid era, the firm has returned to form and is looking to scale up in line with the broader aviation space. Clearly, its investors like what they see, with a 210% jump in its value last year, beating the S&P 500\u2019s gains by 186%. Consequently, SKYW stock emerged as one of the leaders in the airline space in the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother encouraging sign is that the company is back generating positive sales growth as per its latest earnings print. It outperformed analyst estimates across both lines in four of the past five quarters. Picking up from where it left off in the fourth-quarter (Q4), it posted positive sales growth again in its first-quarter (Q1). Revenues jumped $804 million, representing a 16.2% bump on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, beating estimates by $3.93 million. Moreover, its EPS of $1.45 beat out estimates by 26 cents. Moreover, despite the momentum, SKYW stock\u00a0trades at just 0.86 times forward sales estimates, 41% lower than the sector median.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) plays a critical role in the fabrication of semiconductors through its wafer cleaning and wet processing. Its unique technologies ensure the purity and performance of water that\u00a0is subsequently processed\u00a0into chips.\n\nCleaning semiconductor wafers is pivotal in ensuring the quality, consistency, and efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing. Superior cleaning leads to fewer defects while significantly improving yields and cost-effectiveness. Hence, it goes without saying that ACM plays an integral role in the development and overall quality of the semiconductors being produced.\n\nACM stock has experienced a remarkable 431% growth in the past five years, culminating in a nearly 200% increase last year. These substantial gains are a testament to the strength of its business, underscored by a 52% average increase in sales over the past five years. Furthermore, its net income margins have consistently exceeded the 13% mark over the same time period. Hence, with these positive indicators and the support of secular tailwinds, investors can be optimistic about ACM\u2019s future performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

This progress\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in its 26% gross profit margin growth. Thus, the company\u2019s dedication to innovation and improving the client experience\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in the acquisition of Clearline Mobile\u2019s technology and its integration into the SurgePays platform. Moreover, introducing SurgePays\u2019 prepaid cellular business, Linkup Mobile, demonstrates the company\u2019s strategic emphasis on expanding its top line and taking advantage of industry developments.\n\nLastly, SurgePays\u2019 revenue rise is a major sign of the company\u2019s financial stability and market presence.

        "title": "ACM Research and J.B. Hunt have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 23, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares ACM Research ACMR as the Bull of the Day and J.B. Hunt Transport Services JBHT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nACM Research is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops, manufactures, and sells single-wafer wet cleaning equipment for enhancing the manufacturing process and yield for integrated chips.\n\nThe demand for artificial intelligence and the chips that fuel AI have brought demand for ACM's tools. This has helped the company post a long streak of earnings beats, including a 330% EPS beat last quarter.\n\nThe stock has pulled back on the recent tech sell-off so the question for investors is if the current dip presents an opportunity.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nACM Research is headquartered in Fremont, CA, and employs over 1,500.\n\nThe stock has Zacks Style Scores of \"D\" in Growth, Momentum, and Value.\n\nThe company was founded in 1998, has a market cap of $1.4 billion, and a Forward PE of 15. ACMR pays no dividend.\n\nQ4 Earnings Beat\n\nOn February 28th, ACMR reported a 330% EPS beat and saw revenues up 56% y/y. The company affirmed its FY24 outlook range of $650-725M versus the $707M expected.\n\nManagement cited the strength of ACM's multi-product portfolio and its growing customer base. They added that they have captured market share and made notable strides in penetrating international markets.\n\nThe stock gapped higher and ran the next day posting a 30% gain. Investors took notice of this small semiconductor name but it has since pulled back as the next catalyst approaches.\n\nThe company will release its preliminary revenue range on April 26th before the market opens. It will then release its full results on May 8th.\n\nThat first release will likely give investors the green light to buy the stock again or erase the bull's hopes of getting back to recent highs.\n\nAnalyst Estimates\n\nAll indications are that the quarter will be solid as analysts lifted estimates since earnings.\n\nFor the current quarter, estimates over the last 60 days have gone from $0.19 to $0.36, or 89%.\n\nLooking longer term, the current year shows a 19% jump over that same time frame, moving from $1.36 to $1.62.\n\nSince earnings, the stock has seen multiple upgrades and price target hikes.\n\nROTH MKM reiterated its Buy and lifted its target from $25 to $40.\n\nGoldman Sach also reiterated its Buy and has a $39 target.\n\nBenchmark has raised its target twice since earnings, first going to $35, then later to $38.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Technicals\n\nAt its highest point, ACMR was up 70% in 2024. The recent pullback has not been nice to the bulls and the stock is now up only 25% this year.\n\nWhile the upcoming earnings will likely rejuvenate the momentum or erode more gains, there are some levels to look for either way.\n\nThe $19.25 area is the 200-day MA and would be in line with former resistance in 2023. If earnings were to disappoint, this would be the area to enter for long-term players.\n\n$22.75 is the gap fill and the 61.8% retracement from the February lows to the 2024 highs. This is a good spot to see a relief bounce and a possible support area.\n\nIf the bulls gain back momentum, a move back over the $27 area is a 50-day MA break and a bullish signal. A positive earnings report and a break above $29.50 would give the bulls a 21-day MA break and full control of the momentum.\n\nIf we get an impressive preliminary revenue guide, investors could look for the $38 area down the road.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMore investors are looking for smaller stocks to enter the AI/semi-boom. ACMR is a perfect place to be, but a lot of the short-term price movement will be based on upcoming earnings.\n\nDue to the massive demand, the company likely beats once more, but investors need to decide whether to dip their toes in before the preliminary guide or wait for more certainty.\n\nEither way, this is a stock to watch over the next few weeks and if the company holds the earnings momentum, investors should expect new highs before the end of 2024.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a provider of a broad range of transportation services to a diverse group of customers.\n\nThe stock has drifted sideways over the last few years, but a recent earnings report has JBHT trading at the bottom of its multi-year range.\n\nAfter the sixth straight EPS miss, investors might give up on the name, bringing the stock much lower over the short term.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nJ.B. Hunt was founded in 1961 and is headquartered in Lowell, Arkansas. The company employs over 34,000 people and operates through five segments: Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract Services (DCS), Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), Final Mile Services (FMS), and Truckload (JBT). The JBI segment offers intermodal freight solutions\n\nJBHT is valued at $17 billion and has a Forward PE of 25. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \"B\" in Growth, but \"D\" in Value. The stock pays a dividend of just over 1%.\n\nQ1 Earnings\n\nLast week J.B. Hunt reported a Q1 miss of 20%. Revenues came in at $2.94B versus the $3.12B expected as overall demand for intermodal service offerings was weaker than expected.\n\nWhile intermodal revenue was down 9% from last year, Integrated Capacity Solutions revenue took the biggest year-over-year hit, down 26%.\n\nManagement blamed competition from over-the-road truck options in the eastern network, as well as the company's disciplined approach to the market for the value. Management also cited inflationary cost pressures and said that customers continue to feel pressure in their business.\n\nThis was the sixth straight surprise to the downside for JBHT, but the market has given the stock a break almost every time. However, with analysts dropping numbers aggressively since EPS, will investors finally capitulate?\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nOver the 7 days, earnings estimates have come down across all time frames.\n\nFor the current quarter, analysts have dropped estimates from $1.89 to $1.62, or 14%.\n\nFor the next quarter, estimates have been lowered by 10%.\n\nFor the current year, we see an 11% drop, with estimates falling from $7.61 to $6.76\n\nThe drop in estimates is beginning to look like a larger trend. Looking at a long-term term time frame, we see that next year's estimates have fallen 9% over the last 90 days, going from $9.58 to $8.72.\n\nAnalysts are also lowering price targets. Some more notable names include UBS going from $234 to $211 and Barclays dropping to $170 from $200.\n\nTechnical Take\n\nWhen you look at a chart from 2021, we see a range from $160- 200, with the stock seeing a couple of false breakouts above that $200 figure.\n\n$160 is a big support level long-term, so some investors likely will want to buy the current dip. This level has held up about ten times over the last three years, but if it were to break, we might see some panic selling.\n\nThe stock is trading below all its moving averages and took out 2023 lows. This isn't a positive sign when the overall stock market has rallied significantly. If that $160 level were to break, the $130 level could be in play. This is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from COVID lows to all-time highs. This move would be another 20% lower from here so investors should be patient or simply avoid the stock altogether.\n\nIn Summary\n\nThe trucking industry is going through some hurdles in the current economic environment, with one such hurdle being inflationary pressure. J.B. Hunt is also experiencing competition issues, which is hurting revenues.\n\nUntil the company can manage the issues, investors should look elsewhere.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nShould You Consider Alphabet (GOOGL) Ahead of Q1 Earnings?\n\nAlphabet is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 25.\n\nThe company has been benefiting from growing investments in the generative AI technology, expanding presence in the booming cloud-computing market, increasing efforts to improve search results, solid uptake of Android and deepening focus on the wearables category in the quarter under review.\n\nNevertheless, increasing litigation issues and expenses are likely to have been concerning.\n\nLet us delve deeper into the fundamentals of Alphabet ahead of its first-quarter 2024 results.\n\nSearch, YouTube & Ad Efforts to Consider\n\nAlphabet's continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search business are expected to have continued aiding its search revenues in the first quarter.\n\nThe Search Generative Experience, which leverages the generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is likely to have contributed well. With the large language model-powered enhanced search results, Google is anticipated to have driven its search momentum in the quarter under review.\n\nLarge language models, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are expected to have continued improving the search results.\n\nGrowing momentum with Bard is anticipated to have contributed well to Search revenues in the first quarter.\n\nImproving features of Google Maps are expected to have benefited the search traffic.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Search & Other revenues is pegged at $44.73 billion, indicating an increase of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nApart from this, Google's growing advertisement offerings, infused with generative AI technology, are expected to have contributed well to its advertising revenues in the first quarter. Solid momentum in the retail vertical is anticipated to have been a plus.\n\nThe consensus mark for Google advertising is pegged at $60.18 billion, implying growth of 10.3% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure.\n\nComing to non-advertisement revenues of YouTube, strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is likely to have been a tailwind. Google's growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are likely to have acted as a positive.\n\nSolid momentum across YouTubeTV and major updates in YouTube Premium are likely to have been other positives.\n\nThe growing momentum across Android and Pixel devices is expected to have benefited Alphabet's performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe above-mentioned factors are anticipated to have benefited Google's Services segment's performance in the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Services revenues is pegged at $69.04 billion, indicating growth of 11.4% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nStrength in Cloud & Other Bets to Benefit\n\nAlphabet has been significantly gaining momentum in the highly competitive cloud market for a while on the back of its expanding cloud service portfolio and an increasing number of data centers.\n\nThe solid adoption of Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is likely to have contributed well to the performance of the Google Cloud segment in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nIts strengthening generative AI-backed cloud offerings are expected to have driven Google's momentum among cloud customers.\n\nAlphabet's strengthening efforts to bolster its healthcare technology portfolio are expected to have driven growth in its Other Bets segment in the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other Bets revenues is pegged at $384 million, suggesting growth of 33.3% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nEstimate Trend\n\nFor the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $66.02 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.7% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.49, indicating 27.3% growth from the previous year's reported figure. The figure has been unchanged over the past 30 days.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Alphabet this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

It will then release its full results on May 8th.\n\nThat first release will likely give investors the green light to buy the stock again or erase the bull's hopes of getting back to recent highs.\n\nAnalyst Estimates\n\nAll indications are that the quarter will be solid as analysts lifted estimates since earnings.\n\nFor the current quarter, estimates over the last 60 days have gone from $0.19 to $0.36, or 89%.\n\nLooking longer term, the current year shows a 19% jump over that same time frame, moving from $1.36 to $1.62.\n\nSince earnings, the stock has seen multiple upgrades and price target hikes.\n\nROTH MKM reiterated its Buy and lifted its target from $25 to $40.\n\nGoldman Sach also reiterated its Buy and has a $39 target.\n\nBenchmark has raised its target twice since earnings, first going to $35, then later to $38.\n\nThe Technicals\n\nAt its highest point, ACMR was up 70% in 2024. The recent pullback has not been nice to the bulls and the stock is now up only 25% this year.\n\nWhile the upcoming earnings will likely rejuvenate the momentum or erode more gains, there are some levels to look for either way.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe $19.25 area is the 200-day MA and would be in line with former resistance in 2023. If earnings were to disappoint, this would be the area to enter for long-term players.\n\n$22.75 is the gap fill and the 61.8% retracement from the February lows to the 2024 highs. This is a good spot to see a relief bounce and a possible support area.\n\nIf the bulls gain back momentum, a move back over the $27 area is a 50-day MA break and a bullish signal. A positive earnings report and a break above $29.50 would give the bulls a 21-day MA break and full control of the momentum.\n\nIf we get an impressive preliminary revenue guide, investors could look for the $38 area down the road.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMore investors are looking for smaller stocks to enter the AI/semi-boom. ACMR is a perfect place to be, but a lot of the short-term price movement will be based on upcoming earnings.\n\nDue to the massive demand, the company likely beats once more, but investors need to decide whether to dip their toes in before the preliminary guide or wait for more certainty.\n\nEither way, this is a stock to watch over the next few weeks and if the company holds the earnings momentum, investors should expect new highs before the end of 2024.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -18.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, which ACM Research falls in, has lost 9.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share, indicating a change of +140% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.62 points to a change of -0.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 indicates a change of +38.9% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ACM Research is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate of $142.67 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +92.1%. The $698.97 million and $884.31 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +25.3% and +26.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $170.32 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.9%. EPS of $0.43 for the same period compares with $0.19 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.09 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +15.79%. The EPS surprise was +330%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Few investments can match the profit potential of momentum stocks.\u00a0They capture the market\u2019s attention and get swept up in a wave of hype that\u00a0sends their share prices skyrocketing\u2014the\u00a0fear of missing out kicks in, fueling further buying that validates the momentum trade. Before you know it, these stocks have doubled, tripled, or even quintupled within months.\n\nOf course, fundamentals still matter. But with momentum stocks, excitement and hype can override traditional valuation metrics and take prices to dizzying new heights.\u00a0Combining\u00a0strong fundamentals with powerful momentum gives you\u00a0a winning recipe that can deliver triple-digit returns in no time.\n\nThat said, momentum cuts both ways. These stocks can fall\u00a0just\u00a0as fast as they rise when the music stops. A broader market correction, early investors taking profits, or a shift in sentiment could all trigger a painful pullback. So timing and risk management are critical when trading momentum stocks. Still, if entered at the right point with\u00a0a smart\u00a0exit plan, they offer some of the best profit potential\u00a0out there. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) logistics stocks. supply chain stocks\n\nSource: Travel mania / Shutterstock.com\n\nI first wrote about GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) back in mid-December, and this stock has delivered well over 150% gains since then. There is still a lot of fuel left in the tank here, and I believe the momentum will likely carry it higher in the coming months. Let\u2019s look at what GigaCloud does for those unfamiliar with the company, as the name can be misleading. In simple terms, GigaCloud is a B2B e-commerce and logistics company. It offers competitive ocean freight, warehousing and fulfillment services powered by advanced technology and AI.\n\nGCT is seeing explosive growth with some of the best financials in the market, so the current growth in its stock price is more organic than hype-driven. The company had stellar Q4 results. Revenue was up 95% to $245 million and net income was 185% to $36 million. It beat top-line estimates by 9.2% and EPS estimates by 50%. Regardless, it is still cheap at just 13 times forward earnings. We are also looking at EPS surging from $2.9 to $4.5 from 2024 to 2026, along with revenue growing from $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in the same timeframe. This stock can\u00a0definitely\u00a0double from here and still have attractive valuations. It is up 325% in the past six months alone.\n\nIn my view, GCT has a long growth runway ahead. The global logistics industry is worth over $10 trillion and growing rapidly as e-commerce expands.\n\nStory continues\n\nAppLovin (APP) The AppLovin (APP) info on an iPhone and laptop screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is a technology company that provides end-to-end software and AI solutions. It mostly engages in marketing for mobile apps. Their platform enables developers to market, monetize, analyze and publish their apps. The software industry is booming, and with AI entering the space, many software companies are seeing their valuations balloon, with many trading at 10-20 times forward sales due to their high margins.\n\nAppLovin has also seen a significant appreciation in value and currently trades at 6 times forward sales, but I believe it can easily double over the coming months if the momentum keeps strong. EPS is expected to rise from $2.5 to $4 from 2024 to 2026. The business is growing at a 28% CAGR and is expected to reach $4.1 billion in sales in 2024. The stock is up 310% in the past year.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) develops advanced wafer cleaning and wet processing technologies for the semiconductor industry. Their portfolio includes IC and compound semi-manufacturing tools, wafer-level packaging and wafer manufacturing. They offer solutions for single-wafer and batch wet cleaning, electroplating, thermal deposition, stress-free polishing, PECVD and tracking.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is booming, and the megatrends driving this company\u2019s momentum are clear. ACMR has already delivered triple-digit returns since my first buy rating on the stock in June. Analysts expect huge growth, with revenue doubling in the next four years. Since 2020, the company has surpassed all but one quarterly earnings estimate and only missed the revenue mark three times (by less than $1 million).\n\nIn addition, Gurufocus also expects the stock to double by the end of 2026, though momentum could drive it much higher. Its 3-year EPS growth (minus non-recurring items) sits at 119%, better than 96% of peers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For those looking to find strong Computer and Technology stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Is CACI International (CACI) one of those stocks right now? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Computer and Technology sector should help us answer this question.\n\nCACI International is one of 618 companies in the Computer and Technology group. The Computer and Technology group currently sits at #4 within the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions.

These businesses are profiting from changing market trends, such as semiconductor advancements, identity verification technology and the shift to renewable energy sources, even if they don\u2019t often make headlines. Silent millionaire maker stocks aren\u2019t always obvious picks or big names, but they can offer tremendous opportunity for savvy investors.\n\nOf the three companies on this list, the first is a pioneer in semiconductor wafer cleaning solutions. It has seen a sharp increase in sales because of its inventive product line that serves local and foreign consumers. The second is using state-of-the-art identity verification solutions to lead the charge in combating fraud. The third is establishing itself as a dominant force in the worldwide market thanks to its technical advancements and smart investments that are changing the face of renewable energy.\n\nAll three companies are demonstrating tenacity and flexibility as they negotiate shifting market conditions. Each offers a different chance for investors to partake in the quiet wave of wealth creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, sales of single wafer cleaning, Tahoe and semi-critical cleaning products from ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) increased by 43%, accounting for 72% of total sales. Because of its extensive cleaning portfolio, ACM Research is a vital partner for Chinese mature node development and worldwide markets. This portfolio supports about 90% of all cleaning process stages for logic and memory devices.\n\nMoreover, ACM Research leads the market thanks to its flagship Space Alternated Phase Shift (SAPS) Tahoe and Timely Energized Bubble Oscillation (TEBO) single-wafer cleaning solutions. These flagships have technological characteristics that rivals cannot match. The 30-millimeter auto bench cleaning industry has shown good profitability. Thus, the company has had a solid increase in market share since its initial debut.\n\nIn 2023, the combined revenue from furnace, electro-chemical plating (ECP) and other technologies increased by 33%, topping $100 million. The strong performance from ECP, especially in front-end processes, suggests that ACM Research successfully gained market share for total plating.\n\nAdvanced packaging revenue\u00a0increased by 31.5% in 2023 and accounted for 9% of total revenue. ACM Research also anticipates growing demand for high-performance computer applications like artificial intelligence (AI) and launched ULTRA C v Vacuum Cleaning Tools.\n\nStory continues\n\nMitek Systems (MITK) internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecurity\n\nSource: Song_about_summer / Shutterstock\n\nMitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) has continued to increase and progress its products. Recent offerings include ID R&D biometrics software solutions, Check Fraud Defender (CFD), MiVIP and MiPass. Mitek Systems\u2019 focus on advancements and flexibility in responding to market demands is seen in the launch of these new products.\n\nThe company\u2019s Check Fraud Defender product reflects its expansion into related areas like AI-driven fraud and identity management, emphasizing its capacity to leverage new market trends and broaden its top-line. The early momentum with CFD and channel partners shows effective acceptance and cooperation within the banking industry. By the end of the 2024 fiscal year, the firm hopes to have over\u00a050 CFD clients.\n\nDue to increased fraud and cybercrime worldwide, there is a growing need for identity verification and fraud protection solutions. The rise in fraud associated with deepfakes highlights the massive demand for reliable detection systems and biometric authentication tools. Addressing new risks like deepfakes enhances Mitek Systems\u2019 market relevance and growth potential, and solutions like\u00a0IDLive Face Plus put Mitek Systems at the forefront of battling developing fraud concerns.\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.\n\nSource: chuyuss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has invested $500 million in Recurrent Energy with CanadianSolar (NASDAQ:CSIQ). When BlackRock invests in something, that\u2019s a sure sign it\u2019s probably one of the silent millionaire maker stocks. The investment will strengthen the company\u2019s shift to long-term ownership and management of renewable energy projects. Collaborations are being made with organizations such as Sol Systems and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. These expand the company\u2019s operations efficiently and establish a stronger market position.\n\nCanadian Solar\u2019s rapid switch to\u00a0N-type TOPCon solar technology reflects the company\u2019s edge over industry competitors. The company has a strategic emphasis on major markets and localization initiatives. This can be observed in the opening of a module plant in Texas and the robust demand for U.S.-made products. The company has a pipeline of 63 GWh and a committed backlog of $2.6 billion. Canadian Solar\u2019s battery energy storage business, under the e-STORAGE name, provides a lead in the energy storage industry.\n\nCanadian Solar\u2019s robust geographical reach encompasses North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, it reduces the potential risks arising from market variations. The promising project advancements and collaborations in nations such as Mexico, U.S., Brazil and the United Kingdom showcase the company\u2019s aptitude for seizing expansion prospects.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in ACMR.

        "content": "The second quarter of 2024 is set to be a mixed bag for investors as market growth expectations on Wall Street contend with the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy indecision.\n\nAt the beginning of the year there was widespread optimism the Fed would cut rates for the first time since Q1 2020, perhaps as early as March. Stubborn inflation levels, however, slowed some of the hopes for clearing this headwind. Now, the prospect of any cuts taking place in the first half of the year appears to be evaporating.\u00a0The cooling market sentiment has caused some chip stocks to decline in recent weeks.\n\nDespite this, the overall outlook for 2024 appears to be bright. Investment giant BlackRock confirmed that expectations for S&P 500 earnings growth this year have been revised up, with the tech sector set to account for half of the index\u2019s earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis indicates that Q2 2024 may be a little more volatile as markets wait for the Fed to signal how its more dovish stance on monetary policy will play out. Still, many high-potential small-cap stocks can rally throughout the coming months, including the three key candidates highlighted below.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite a modest market capitalization of around $2 billion, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a stock that consistently wins the backing of institutional investors.\u00a0Recently Vanguard Group increased its exposure to the company by adding 399,854 shares, bringing its total holdings to 4,082,835 for a total stake worth $73,920,000.\n\nThe strong institutional support also helped its stock rally higher in recent months. Shares grew 81.6% in Q1 2024 and doubled in size during the 2023 calendar year.\n\nAs a company with exposure to the booming semiconductor industry, ACM Research\u2019s reputation as a cheap growth company has served it well and earned it a \u2018strong buy\u2019 rating from Seeking Alpha\u2019s Quant system.\n\nIn addition to institutional support, ACMR also boasts strong fundamentals. With a three-year sales growth rate of 53% and a three-year earnings-per-share (EPS) growth rate of 62%, there\u2019s plenty of optimism flooding into this small-cap stock. The semiconductor equipment maker could see its value continue to rally throughout the second quarter of 2024 and beyond.\n\nTitan Machinery (TITN) Tractor spraying pesticides on soybean field with sprayer\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAt a market capitalization of $540 million, there appears to be plenty of room for growth for agricultural and construction equipment seller Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN). Consistent growth in company earnings and recent share price underperformance appear to have made the stock an attractive prospect for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Titan\u2019s revenue increased to $583 million, up from the $507.6 million reported in Q4 2022. Gross profit also increased to $108.9 million compared to $94.2 million the previous year.\n\nDespite this, the stock has struggled to build momentum. From a March 2023 peak of $47.17, shares have instead fallen nearly 50% since. Yet the company\u2019s current earnings power and a recent series of strategic acquisitions make the stock look cheap. Investors may be tempted to back TITN to recapture its early 2023 performance and build a solid recovery starting in this quarter.\n\nAccording to Titan\u2019s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 4.9x, the company is trading far below its peer average of 13.27x. This highlights that the stock is trading at a lower price than the wider trade distributors industry. As a result, we may see a more optimistic outlook for the firm resulting in stronger institutional interest for the discounted stock. An upturn in wider market fortunes could result in TITN accelerating at a faster pace than other industry players.\n\nStride (LRN) a child takes notes while attending an online class. represents education stocks. edtech stocks\n\nSource: Travelerpix / Shutterstock.com\n\nThanks to whirlwind growth in 2023, online education firm Stride (NYSE:LRN) is now trading at a new all-time high following its 2007 debut on the NYSE.\n\nFollowing growth of around 80% over the past calendar year, the stock has had a cooler start to 2024. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped the $2.7 billion market cap firm from positioning itself as an excellent market opportunity for investors.\n\nImpressively, Stride\u2019s earnings-per-share growth of 47% over the past three years illustrates the form that the company has experienced of late and points to a company undergoing a successful scaling operation.\n\nStride\u2019s fundamentals also offer cause for optimism. Revenue grew 10.13% to $504.87 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while net profit also grew an impressive 31.81% over the same period to $66.84 million. Crucially, Stride generated a seismic 1,203.15% acceleration in net profit margins between Q3 and Q4 2023.\n\nThis has increased optimism for the company, helping to build a steady platform to secure further momentum throughout the quarter ahead and beyond.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) is a Great Choice",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. ACM Research, Inc. Currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if ACMR is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor ACMR, shares are up 9.95% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry is up 3.59% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.39% compares favorably with the industry's 4.91% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of ACM Research, Inc. Have increased 51.01% over the past quarter, and have gained 192.6% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 9.13% and 28.2%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to ACMR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ACMR is currently averaging 1,375,606 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ACMR.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ACMR's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.34 to $1.62 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ACMR is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep ACM Research, Inc. On your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days. Click to get this free report\n\nACM Research, Inc.

        "content": "Mid-cap stocks often fly under the radar of many investors more focused on the stability of large-cap stocks. However, mid-caps offer a unique blend of growth prospects and stability, especially if they\u2019re profitable.\n\nDelving into this investing realm is not for everyone, as identifying the top contenders whose growth will remain consistent can be challenging. These stocks embody the ethos of growth-oriented investing, where astute choices could make or break your investment portfolio. That is why diversification is key, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. However, with the right approach, these asymmetric bets can yield substantial rewards.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top mid-cap stocks for life-changing gains in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a leading wafer packaging and semiconductor cleaning company headquartered in Fremont, California. It has seen an acceleration in revenue growth and profitability over the last seven years, and that growth is likely to continue.\n\nACM Research is not a semiconductor company you will see in the spotlight too often. That is likely because of its ties to China, which many North American investors are on the fence about. However, the increasing demand for chips powering everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence (AI) is a major tailwind for the business. Additionally, the incoming rebound in the wafer fabrication market paints a beautiful picture for the next several quarters. In FY23, ACM\u2019s revenue swelled 43% year-over-year (YOY) to $557.72 million. Net income skyrocketed 97% YOY to $77.35 million, or $1.16 per share. While you should proceed with caution, management\u2019s guidance of up to 30% revenue growth in FY24 is a positive sign for the future.\n\nQualys (QLYS) A Qualys sign hanging on a corporate office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) stands at the forefront as a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions. It offers a cloud-based platform that helps organizations remediate vulnerabilities, ensuring the security of its IT infrastructure.\n\nQualys, while a much smaller player in the cybersecurity sector, is slowly making a name for itself. Its TruRisk platform prioritizes threat vulnerabilities and helps businesses optimize IT security workflows. The platform has more than 10,000 customers, and its vulnerability management, detection and response (VDMR) software is a game-changer. Qualys delivered strong operational results in the 2023 fiscal year. Revenue increased 13% YOY to $554.5 million. EPS ballooned 47% YOY to $4.03 per share, with FCF surpassing the $200 million mark. The company has demonstrated its ability to consistently drive profitable growth, making it a no-brainer buy for 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) A series of roads and overpasses connect in an aerial view.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) might just be one of those mid-cap stocks investors look back on and kick themselves for not buying. The business has been on a roll for the last several years, and there are a number of tailwinds to suggest growth will continue.\n\nSterling Infrastructure primarily focuses on infrastructure solutions, including transportation, e-infrastructure and building projects. Its portfolio is extremely diverse, spanning highways, roads, bridges, airports and even data centers. The company has a long track record of securing and completing large-scale infrastructure projects, primarily in the United States. In FY23, Sterling\u2019s revenue increased 11% YOY to $1.97 billion. EPS increased 28% YOY to $4.44 per share, with gross margins expanding by 350 basis points to 18.9%. The company closed out the year with a backlog of over $2 billion, as it continued its streak of new contract awards. With strong top and bottom line growth projected for FY24, STRL stock is one of the best mid-cap stocks worth a shot for life-changing gains in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +10.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, which ACM Research falls in, has gained 2.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +140%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -0.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 indicates a change of +38.9% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ACM Research.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $142.67 million indicates a year-over-year change of +92.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $698.97 million and $884.31 million estimates indicate +25.3% and +26.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nACM Research reported revenues of $170.32 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.9%. EPS of $0.43 for the same period compares with $0.19 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.09 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +15.79%. The EPS surprise was +330%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nACM Research is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Secret Millionaires: 3 Underpriced Stocks to Skyrocket Your Wealth",
        "content": "Among a sea of growing companies, three undervalued stocks with potential have floated to the surface. Despite their undervaluation, these equities offer investors attractive opportunities to augment their portfolios with assets expected to rise in value.\n\nThe first one sticks out due to its remarkable financial results and unwavering dedication to innovation. Although shipments have fluctuated recently, the business expects a significant shipment increase for the following year.\n\nThe second one employs a calculated approach to financial restructuring to strengthen its market share in Latin America. The firm attains financial flexibility by renegotiating debt arrangements and extending payment periods, opening up prospects for sustainable growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe third one demonstrates tenacity in the face of inflationary pressures, skillfully controlling expenses while investing substantial money in exploratory endeavors. The company is a profitable avenue for capital appreciation, concentrating on the exploration and production of oil and gas.\n\nLearn how these three equities, taken as a whole, promise more than the average financial asset due to unrealized potential.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it. Semiconductor stocks to sell. Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOperating margins for ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) were 21% and 22% for Q4 and 2023, respectively. This demonstrates the company\u2019s continued solid financial performance and bottom line. The company expects a notable increase in shipments for Q1 2024 despite a decrease in shipments during Q4 2023. Overall, projected shipments could surpass revenue growth for the whole year.\n\nOn the other hand, developing new products demonstrates the direct relationship between ACM Research\u2019s constant innovation efforts and revenue growth. These include the semi-critical CO2 dry cleaning tool, the high-temperature sulfuric peroxide mix (SPM) single wafer cleaning tool, and the bevel etch cleaning tool.\n\nMoreover, ACM Research\u2019s operating margins increased from 17.2% in 2022 to 22.1% in 2023, indicating increased profitability and operational efficiency. In summary, strong operating margins attest to ACM Research\u2019s capacity to control expenses and profit. Thanks to this financial approach, ACMR has overcome supply chain limitations compared to other undervalued stocks with potential similar to itself.\n\nZenvia (ZENV) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nRecent agreements to restructure its financial liabilities highlight Zenvia\u2019s (NASDAQ:ZENV) strategic attempts to overcome its funding deficit. The agreements comprise extensions of bank short-term debt, amounting to around 100 million Brazilian reais (BRL). The 36-month extended payment term includes a 6-month grace period and 30 monthly installments, with the ultimate maturity occurring in December 2026. Thus, this extension gives Zenvia more time and financial flexibility to fulfill its commitments.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, renegotiating earnouts further reduces the immediate financial burden. Specifically, Movidesk and D1, two companies Zenvia took on debt to acquire, have had their earnouts adjusted. Movidesk\u2019s total debt earnout stands at around 207 million BRL, and D1\u2019s is around 20 million BRL. Thanks to negotiations, the new maturation dates for these earnouts are December 2026 and December 2028 respectively. The extended payment terms\u201460 months for Movidesk\u2019s earnout and 36 months for D1\u2019s\u2014effectively stretch the financial commitments over a more manageable timetable.\n\nFinally, after considering the revised EBITDA projection and the conversion of Movidesk\u2019s earnout into equity, Zenvia\u2019s pro-forma debt could be around 2.0x by the end of 2024. In short, with a good debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a balanced leverage ratio, Zenvia may achieve long-term growth and expansion in the Latin American market.\n\nGran Tierra (GTE) Image of an oil wells with a dark blue sky\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDespite inflationary pressures, Gran Tierra (NYSEAMERICAN:GTE) has proven its cost management strategies effective.\n\nHowever, even with cost control efforts, operating expenditures per barrel grew by\u00a08% in 2023. This is mostly due to maintenance activities. Gran Tierra somewhat offset the decline in net oil sales in 2023 by increasing sales volumes and reducing transportation discounts.\n\nMeanwhile, Gran Tierra Energy has the potential for long-term growth because of its strategic investments and exploration efforts. The business has allocated\u00a040% and 45% of its 2024 capital program to high-impact exploratory projects. These involve boring exploratory wells in Ecuador and Colombia to find new deposits and promote a steady increase in output. Gran Tierra\u2019s year-end reserves were the largest in the organization\u2019s history, thanks to large acquisitions in every reserve category.\n\nFinally, Gran Tierra demonstrated effective capital allocation and financial discipline in 2023 by producing $58 million in free cash flow. In 2023, the business paid down\u00a0$6.9 million in debt and bought back shares, acquiring around 6.8% of all outstanding shares.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in ACMR.

        "content": "The\u00a0Russell 2000, an index tracking the performance of small-to-mid-cap companies, continues to struggle against its peer indices, largely repeating the events of last year. In 2023, The Russell 2000 increased 16.8%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices appreciated 24.2% and 43.4%, respectively. The index had been trailing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since then. In 2024, the Russell 2000 is up slightly more than 2%, while the S&P500 and Nasdaq are trading upward at 9.1% and 6.9%, respectively.\n\nBecause of the Russell 2000\u2019s lackluster performance, there are some stocks, trading at low multiples and operating in interesting markets, worth looking into. Below are three names.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a semiconductor equipment manufacturer. In particular, ACM Research supplies semiconductor manufacturers with wet processing equipment and technologies, and the manufacturer has a particular focus on China\u2019s domestic semiconductor market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research\u2019s earnings results throughout 2023 were admittedly impressive and beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Its recent\u00a0earnings report was no different. Full-year revenue\u00a0climbed\u00a043% year-over-year to $558 million. ACM Research expects solid double-digit revenue growth in 2024 as well. During this period, the company expects its Shanghai-based unit to grow substantially.\n\nFurthermore, while markets have slumped over the past week, ACMR shares continue to trend upward. Currently, the stock is up nearly 64% for the year. The company\u2019s share price is also trading at relatively cheap valuation multiples. ACMR\u2019s forward EV/EBITDA is around 14.7x, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio is 21.9x. ACM Research is cheap when compared to other\u00a0semiconductor stocks out there, and the company\u2019s growth prospects could help it rally even further.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ2 Holdings (QTWO) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nQ2 Holdings (NYSE:QTWO) is the only fintech company to make this list. In particular, Q2 provides a number of digital banking solutions to community and regional banks in order for them to better serve their customer base. For over a decade since the company went public, Q2 has delivered double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, and the company has also improved net margins in the past couple of years.\n\nThe fintech company\u2019s\u00a0fourth-quarter results came in line with Wall Street estimates. Revenue for the quarter came in at $162.1 million, growing by more than 11% year over year, while full-year revenue was around $624.6 million, growing by just over 10% on a year-over-year basis. Wall Street analysts seem pretty happy with the stock as well. Several Wall Street firms, including Baird, RBC, and DA Davidson, have increased their price target for QTWO. Couple this with the fact many analysts expect Q2 to break even in the coming quarters and the fintech company\u2019s shares seem like a decent buy.\n\nDorian LPG (LPG) Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.\n\nSource: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.com\n\nDorian LPG (NYSE:LPG) transports liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\u00a0through its LPG tankers worldwide. As of February 2024, the company owns and operates a fleet of 25 very large gas carriers (VLGCs). The current machinations of commodities markets had helped Dorian LPG\u2019s shares skyrocket to new heights in late 2023. In their Q2 earnings print, for example, the company highlighted higher propane and butane prices in Northwest Europe and Northeast Asia. They also noted U.S. exports of LPG improved sequentially. In the company\u2019s Q3 earnings print, released in February, the company delivered stellar financial results across the board. Revenue increased 58% YOY to $163.1 million, while net income nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis to $99.9 million.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares have\u00a0underperformed the market in 2024, falling around 6% on a year-to-date basis, but Dorian\u2019s valuation is quite cheap, trading at 6.7x forward earnings. Moreover, the shipping company\u2019s prospects remain positive as shipping rates will likely remain elevated for some time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Small-Cap Stocks for the Thinking Speculator",
        "content": "It may sound counterintuitive but if you want big gains, you have to think small, as in small-cap stocks. Here, the idea is to trade predictability for maximum profit potential.\n\nTo be sure, the aforementioned elements generally feature a counterbalancing framework. For example, the companies that feature the greatest magnitude of predictability are the established, large-capitalization businesses. However, you\u2019re not going to get much profit potential because everybody expects them to perform consistently.\n\nOn the other hand, small-cap stocks are wildly unpredictable. But you need this volatility to extract the biggest upside potential. If that sounds like an attractive gameplan, these lesser-known ideas may be right for you.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCECO Environmental (CECO) energy stocks to buy: two light bulbs with grey sky in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFalling under the industrial sector, CECO Environmental (NASDAQ:CECO) conducts business in the pollution and treatment control space. Per its public profile, the company offers solutions in industrial air quality, industrial water treatment and energy transition protocols worldwide. Since the start of the year, CECO gained more than 18% of its equity value.\n\nFundamentally, it\u2019s no surprise that CECO has performed so well in 2024. Politically and ideologically, the narrative has shifted toward environmental protection. Notably, analysts rate CECO a unanimous strong buy. Overall, the average price target lands at $26.80, implying over 13% upside potential. The high-side estimate lands at $30.\n\nLast year, CECO enjoyed a solid performance, printing a positive earnings surprise of 12.5%. Its best result came in the third quarter when it generated earnings per share of 22 cents against an expected target of 18 cents.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate revenue of $601.14 million. That\u2019s up over 10% from last year\u2019s tally of $544.85 million. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the small-cap stocks to consider.\n\nVAALCO Energy (EGY) businesswoman drawing large fish eating small fish to represent large-cap stock index funds\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nAn independent hydrocarbon energy specialist, VAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) focuses on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It operates in multiple countries, including Gabon, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea and Canada. Since the start of the year, EGY gained almost 60% of its equity value. It could be on for even more gains.\n\nRight now, analysts are pegging EGY as a unanimous strong buy. It\u2019s not a mistake in my view. With the geopolitical flashpoint in Europe likely to worsen before it gets better, hydrocarbon supplies to Western nations may be limited. Since these countries represent the biggest economies in the world, demand will rise against artificially falling supply. Investors just need to do the math.\n\nTo be sure, Vaalco performed poorly in 2023. For example, the average quarterly surprise between Q1 and Q3 came out to 43.4% below breakeven. And analysts on paper anticipate 2024 revenue to reach $430.27 million, down 5.4% from last year\u2019s print.\n\nIn my opinion, the projections will be revised upward eventually given the geopolitical realities. EGY is therefore one of the possible small-cap stocks to buy.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a tiny man with boxing gloves having defeated a much larger man who is knocked out on the ground. nano-cap stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nListed under the technology sphere, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) operates in the semiconductor equipment and materials subcategory. Per its corporate profile, ACM develops, manufactures and sells single-wafer wet cleaning equipment for enhancing the manufacturing process and yield for integrated chips worldwide. Since the start of the year, ACMR stock gained nearly 72% of its equity value.\n\nJust because it already enjoyed a robust performance doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t deliver even more for prospective investors. Currently, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with a $37.75 average price target. That implies almost 18% upside potential.\n\nMuch of the excitement centers on ACM\u2019s strong financial performance. In Q4 last year, the company posted EPS of 43 cents against an expected print of 17 cents. As the semiconductor sector rises due to increased demand, ACM\u2019s critical services will likely attract the spotlight.\n\nExperts see fiscal 2024 revenue hitting $701.7 million, up nearly 26% from last year. This is easily one of the top small-cap stocks to buy.\n\nPAR Technology (PAR) a giant businessman standing in the middle of the road towering over a smaller, cowardly business man\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother tech player, PAR Technology (NYSE:PAR) focuses on the application software realm. With its subsidiaries, Par provides omnichannel cloud-based hardware and software solutions to the restaurant and retail industries worldwide. Granted, this is a bit of a riskier idea among small-cap stocks. Reflecting this dynamic, PAR stock gained less than 2% since the beginning of this year.\n\nStill, let\u2019s look at the fundamentals. According to Deloitte, while the revenge travel phenomenon may be fading, consumers are still prioritizing travel. If so, that means restaurants \u2013 while hard hit right now \u2013 could eventually enjoy downwind benefits. Because of this dynamic, I don\u2019t find PAR stock\u2019s moderate buy assessment anywhere near shocking.\n\nIn fairness, Par suffered some ugly financial numbers. In the first half of last year, its quarterly surprise averaged 44.1% below breakeven. And in Q4, the company posted a loss of 33 cents against expected red ink of 26 cents per share.\n\nHowever, looking to fiscal 2024, experts anticipate revenue of $480.44 million. That\u2019s up almost 16% from last year\u2019s result of $415.82 million. For patient investors, PAR could be one of the small-cap stocks to buy.\n\nApplied Optoelectronics (AAOI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWorking under the communication equipment category, Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) designs, manufactures and sells fiber-optic networking products in the U.S., Taiwan and China. According to its public profile, Applied offers myriad products, including optical modules, optical filters and laser components, among many others. However, it\u2019s one of the riskiest ideas among small-cap stocks, suffering a 33% year-to-date loss.\n\nNevertheless, that\u2019s not the entire story. In the past 52 weeks, AAOI stock gained slightly over 485% of equity value. As a result, some corrective action was arguably inevitable. After this bout of red ink diminishes, contrarians may want to jump back into the trade. Analysts are looking at shares as a moderate buy with an $18 price target. That implies nearly 44% upside potential.\n\nOne reason for having confidence in Applied is its quarterly print. In Q4 last year, the company posted EPS of four cents. The expected target? A breakeven quarter. For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for a loss per share of nine cents on revenue of $287.93 million.\n\nLast year, the top line landed at $217.65 million, meaning the expectation calls for 32.3% growth.\n\nCouchbase (BASE) a tiny man with boxing gloves standing next to the feet of a giant man whom he presumably knocked out\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConducting business in the software infrastructure arena, Couchbase (NASDAQ:BASE) provides a cloud database platform for enterprise applications in the U.S. and internationally. According to its corporate profile, the company\u2019s database works in multiple configurations, ranging from cloud to multi- or hybrid-cloud to on-premise environments to the edge. With so many enterprises migrating to the cloud, BASE stock could be an intriguing upside idea.\n\nAnother reason to consider BASE as one of the top small-cap stocks is the underlying financial performance. Last fiscal year, the company\u2019s average quarterly surprise came out to 37.75%. Its best print was Q4, where Couchbase delivered a loss of six cents per share, better than the projected loss of 14 cents.\n\nFor the current fiscal year (2025), experts are looking for sales of $205.63 million. If so, we\u2019re talking about growth of 14.2% from 2023\u2019s tally of $180.04 million. And in fiscal 2026, they anticipate a top line of $241.3 million, implying 17.3% year-over-year growth. If you\u2019re into high potential small-cap stocks, BASE should be on your radar.\n\nLigand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) huge person next to tiny person to represent mega-cap stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOperating under the healthcare umbrella, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:LGND) focuses on biotechnology. Per its corporate profile, Ligand engages in the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets worldwide. Its commercial programs include Kyprolis and Evomela, which are used to treat multiple myeloma and Rylaze, a therapeutic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to support biotechs like LGND stock thanks to their lifesaving potential. However, the space is also volatile and unpredictable. For Ligand, its shares have only gained about 8% so far this year. Over the past 52 weeks, it has gained less than 7%.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 8, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Lam Research Corp. LRCX, Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and ACM Research, Inc. ACMR.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Solid Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on Rebounding Sales\n\nThe semiconductor industry is having a bumpy ride. Sales have been steadily making a rebound but the challenges are far from over. However, the future holds promise given the high demand for chips.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said on Apr 3 that global semiconductor sales totaled $46.2 billion in February, up 16.3% year over year. Sales in February 2023 totaled $39.7 billion.\n\nHowever, after a steady rise over the past few months, semiconductor sales fell 3.1% from January's total of $47.6.\n\nRegionally, year-over-year sales increased 28.8% in China, 22% in the Americas and 15.4% in Asia Pacific. However, sales declined 8.5% in Europe.\n\nJohn Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, \"Although month-to-month sales were down slightly, global semiconductor sales in February remained well ahead of the total from the same month last year, a continuation of the strong year-to-year growth the market has experienced since the middle of last year.\"\n\nThe semiconductor industry's growth stalled after reaching unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic.\n\nRising costs, supply-chain disruptions, and higher interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's aggressive efforts to combat inflation acted as headwinds for the industry, particularly as demand slowed during the second half of 2022.\n\nAs inflation began to ease, alleviating price pressures, demand rebounded.\n\nAlso, the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, is expected to stimulate semiconductor sales in the near term. Experts believe that AI has tremendous potential and the world is yet to witness that.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis has seen a large number of tech companies exploring the avenue in their bid to grab business opportunities. This is further likely to make semiconductors all the more important in the near term.\n\nAccording to a forecast by Gartner, global semiconductor revenues are projected to jump 16.8% this year totaling $624 billion.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA Corp.,Lam Research Corp., Applied Materials, Inc., Micron Technology, Inc. and ACM Research, Inc., which investors can gain from in the near term.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "title": "Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In ACM Research, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ACMR) Stock?",
        "content": "ACM Research's (NASDAQ:ACMR) stock is up by a considerable 65% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ACM Research's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ACM Research\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ACM Research is:\n\n10% = US$97m \u00f7 US$926m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nACM Research's Earnings Growth And 10% ROE\n\nTo start with, ACM Research's ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 14%, we aren't very excited. Still, we can see that ACM Research has seen a remarkable net income growth of 38% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared ACM Research's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 29%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about ACM Research's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs ACM Research Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nGiven that ACM Research doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with ACM Research's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "content": "The technology industry has outpaced nearly another market sector within the last year and has added a tremendous amount of growth to the S&P 500. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is considered a benchmark for the tech industry, which has grown by 37% within the last year. The ever-advancing field of generative AI and other innovative technology, such as cloud computing and increased semiconductor production, has led the technology industry down a path of immense profitability.\n\nHere are a few investment options within the tech industry that have performed very well recently. They are also strong buy stocks that could continue to grow throughout 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is primarily a technology infrastructure company that offers storage and server systems such as full racks, blade servers, security software, subsystems, and rack-mount servers. Its products are used in data centers, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market over the past year, growing nearly ninefold during that time due to increased earnings growth and a surge of investors flocking to companies that provide new and innovative tech, especially within the cloud computing and generative AI industries.\n\nOn Jan. 29, SMCI released its earnings for the\u00a0second quarter of fiscal year 2024, in which it stated that total revenue more than doubled to $3.7 billion, and net income rose by 68% compared to the previous year. Management reported that the anticipated revenue for SMCI in the third quarter of FY 2024 is between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion.\n\nEarlier last month, it was announced that Super Micro Computer would be\u00a0added to the S&P 500 following its scheduled rebalance. SMCI replaced Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR). This move further legitimizes Super Micro Computer as a strong company with further upside potential, which makes it a great option for investors in 2024, even after its impressive share price growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAppLovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nAppLovin (NADSAQ:APP) is an application software company that provides an advertising infrastructure platform with products such as MAX, Spark, AppDiscovery, SparkLabs, Array, and Adjust.\n\nSimilar to SMCI, AppLovin has received plenty of positive attention for its involvement in innovation within the generative AI space, which has brought tremendous growth.\n\nOn Feb. 14, APP repotted earnings results for the\u00a0fourth quarter of the full year 2023, in which it stated that it beat analyst expectations for total revenue, which increased by 36% year-over-year. Its earnings per share were forty-nine cents per share, which beat by fourteen cents per share. In a press release, AppLovin reported a secondary offering of common stock by KKR Denali Holdings of nearly 20 million shares. It has also announced a share buyback program of $570 million worth of shares.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has more than quadrupled, with continued growth expected due to its strong positioning within the rapidly growing tech industry. It is a solid pick for investors looking for greater exposure within companies that have profited heavily from the expansion of generative AI.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a producer of semiconductor-related equipment. It offers wafer cleaning equipment and electrochemical plating technology.\n\nACM Research is still surprisingly considered an undervalued company, especially in the realm of many other semiconductor-related stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which have experienced growing popularity and a large increase in overall share price.\n\nOn Feb. 28, it reported earnings for the\u00a0fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, which stated that net income increased by 64% year-over-year. ACMR also beat analyst predictions for revenue by $21 million and earnings per share by twenty-six cents per share.\n\nACM Research is a strong buy stock within the semiconductor industry. Its share price has more than doubled within this last year, primarily due to its outstanding earnings report for the fourth quarter, which immediately, upon release, propelled its share price by over 40%. It is poised for continued growth with revenue guidance for the full year 2024 of between $650 million and $750 million, topping the full-year 2023 results of $558 million by at least 17%.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton held a LONG position\u00a0in APP.

        "title": "Has AppFolio (APPF) Outpaced Other Computer and Technology Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Is AppFolio (APPF) one of those stocks right now? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nAppFolio is a member of our Computer and Technology group, which includes 619 different companies and currently sits at #6 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. AppFolio is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for APPF's full-year earnings has moved 49.4% higher within the past quarter.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in ACM Research (ACMR): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nACM Research currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.14, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by seven brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.14 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the seven recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 14.3% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ACM Research here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ACM Research, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in ACMR?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ACM Research, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 15.1% over the past month to $1.62.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ACM Research. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ACM Research may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, popularly known as March Madness, kicked off last week and is expected to continue for two more weeks. The champion will be crowned on Apr 8 at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, AZ. The tournament works its way up from 64 college teams to \u201cSweet Sixteen,\u201d to be played on Mar 28, followed by \u201cElite Eight,\u201d \u201cFinal Four,\u201d and ultimately, the championship.\r\n\r\nThe extravaganza is not limited to the sports space but spreads to the investment world as it fuels growth in various corners such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Millions of Americans seek to capitalize on this opportunity by enthusiastically filling in the brackets that could lead to handsome returns from the stocks to be wagered on.\r\n\r\nSince the tournament has reached Sweet Sixteen, let\u2019s start filling the brackets from this level and then compare those as we do for March Madness to get to the real winner.\n\nHere\u2019s How to Pick the Sweet 16 Stocks\n\nAkin to the basketball championship, we have chosen four sectors \u2013 construction, computer and technology, retail and industrial products \u2013 out of the 16 Zacks sectors that have outperformed over the past year. We have picked the four best industries (within the top 45%) from each sector with the help of the Zacks Industry Rank.\r\n\r\nThen, we picked one stock from each industry having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with the highest market capitalization in order to get the Sweet 16 stocks. Top-ranked stocks indicate rising earnings estimates and those with strong earnings momentum are more likely to outpace the market. This was a cakewalk, courtesy of the Zacks Stock Screener. You can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nOnce the stocks were chosen, one-year performance was considered for the qualifiers to the Elite Eight. Notably, the stocks with the highest industry ranks will match up with the stocks having low industry ranks.\n\nStory continues\n\nConstruction\n\nThe four top industries and their best stocks in the construction sector are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Building Products - Air Conditioner and Heating: Rank in the top 2%; Stock \u2013 Comfort Systems USA FIX\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Building Products - Miscellaneous: Rank in the top 3%; Stock \u2013 CRH plc CRH\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Building Products - Maintenance Service: Rank in the top 11%; Stock \u2013 Limbach Holdings, Inc LMB\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Building Products - Home Builders: Rank in the top 19%; Stock \u2013 NVR NVR\r\n\r\nFIX vs. NVR: Here, Comfort Systems easily outpaced NVR as it gained about 124% in a year compared with a 45.3% gain for the latter.\r\nCRH vs. LMB: Limbach is clearly the winner as it has returned nearly 155% in a year versus a gain of 77% for CRH plc.\n\nComputer and Technology\n\nThe four top industries and their best stocks in the computer and technology sector are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services: Rank in the top 1%; Stock \u2013 ACM Research ACMR\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Semiconductor Memory: Rank in the top 1%; Stock \u2013 Micron Technology Inc. MU\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Electronics - Miscellaneous Services: Rank in the top 4%; Stock \u2013 Jack Henry & Associates JKHY\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Internet - Delivery Services: Rank in the top 5%; Stock \u2013 Vipshop VIPS\r\n\r\nACMR vs. VIPS: Here, ACM Research wins over Vipshop as it has returned more than 169% in a year versus a gain of 6% for the latter.\r\nMU vs. JKHY: Micron Technology beats Jack Henry & Associates in the same period, gaining 100% compared with an 11% gain for JKHY.\n\nRetail\n\nThe four top industries and their best stocks in the basic materials sector are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Food - Natural Foods Products: Rank in the top 5%; Stock \u2013 Sprouts Farmers Market SFM\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Retail - Supermarkets: Rank in the top 20%; Stock \u2013 The Kroger Co. KR\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts: Rank in the top 20%; Stock \u2013 Hagerty HGTY\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Retail - Miscellaneous: Rank in the top 22%; Stock \u2013 DICK'S Sporting Goods DKS\r\n\r\nSFM vs. DKS: SFM wins against DKS by a wide margin of 27% over the past year.\r\nKR vs. HGTY: Kroger easily defeated Hagerty by climbing 15.3% versus a 5.4% gain for the latter.\n\nIndustrial Products\n\nThe four top industries and their best stocks in the industrial products sector are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Metal Products - Distribution: Rank in the top 4%; Stock \u2013 Constellium CSTM\r\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Commercial Printing: Rank in the top 5%; Stock \u2013 Quad Graphics QUAD\r\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Wire and Cable Products: Rank in the top 7%; Stock \u2013 Encore Wire WIRE\r\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Manufacturing - Tools & Related Products: Rank in the top 7%; Stock \u2013 Enerpac Tool Group EPAC\r\n\r\nCSTM vs. EPAC: Constellium edged past Enerpac Tool with a gain of about 43% versus 34.4% for the latter.\r\nQUAD vs. WIRE: Encore Wire beats Quad Graphics in the same period, gaining 40.3% against 28.6% for QUAD.\r\n\r\nThe winners of each industry group will compete against each other in the Elite Eight.\n\nElite Eight\n\nAmong the eight winning stocks, the highest average earnings surprise over the past four quarters was used to decide the winners of each sector that should advance to the Final Four.\r\n\r\nFIX vs. LMB: Comfort Systems delivered an average earnings surprise of 25.49% compared with 105.21% for Limbach. Hence, LMB wins over FIX.\r\n\r\nACMR vs. MU: ACM Research wins with an average earnings surprise of 255.72% over the past four quarters against 59.60% for Micron Technology.\r\n\r\nSFM vs. KR: Sprouts Farmers Market wins over The Kroger with its average four-quarter beat being 9.99%, higher than 8.52% for KR.\r\n\r\nCSTM vs. WIRE: Here, Encore Wire is clearly the winner, with an average earnings surprise of 3.98% versus a negative surprise of 30.52% for Constellium.\n\nFinal Four\n\nWe now have the best stocks from four sectors. To advance to the next level, we have considered the year-over-year earnings growth for fiscal 2024. Let us once again dig into the Zacks Industry Rank of the four stocks to decide the contenders.\r\n\r\nLimbach Holdings Inc (LMB) \u2013 Zacks Industry Rank in the top 11%\r\nACM Research (ACMR) \u2013 Zacks Industry Rank in the top 1%\r\nSprouts Farmers Market (SFM) \u2013 Zacks Industry Rank in the top 5%\r\nConstellium (CSTM) \u2013 Zacks Industry Rank in the top 4%\r\n\r\nSo, in the matchups, we have ACM Research and Limbach on the one side and Constellium and Sprouts Farmers Market on the other.\r\n\r\nACM Research vs. Limbach: ACM Research earnings are expected to decline 0.61% for this fiscal year, while Limbach will likely see 6.8% growth. As a result, LMB wins and advances toward the final round to take on the winner of CSTM vs. SFM.\r\n\r\nConstellium vs. Sprouts Farmers Market: Here, earnings at CSTM are expected to grow 109.9% for this year, while SFM will see earnings growth of 3.87%. With a higher projected earnings growth rate, CSTM wins and will face Limbach for the championship.\n\nThe National Championship\n\nLet\u2019s look at the VGM Score (V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum), which is simply a weighted combination of the three. The VGM Score rates each stock on its combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum across the board. Stocks with a VGM Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank of #1 or #2 offer better returns, on average, than the individual components, as it considers three times as many items that are correlated to future stock returns.\r\n\r\nThere is a tie between the two candidates \u2013 Limbach and Constellium \u2013 as both of them have a VGM Score of A. However, Limbach wins with a Growth Score of A versus B for CSTM. Both have a Value Score of A and a Momentum Score of F.\n\nResult\n\nBased on our internal research and metrics, Limbach Holdings, having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A, emerges as the winner of the 2024 March Madness contest and could be a top bet for this year. Limbach provides building systems. It engineers, constructs and services the mechanical, plumbing, air conditioning, heating, building automation, electrical and control systems. The stock has a market capitalization of $471.6 million. With Fed rate cuts likely this year, LMB looks a compelling choice for investors.\r\n\r\nWhile it was exciting and fun to dribble toward the winning stock, we expect the twists and turns in the NCAA tournament to lead to some dramatic moves in the investment world.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "2024 is shaping up to be another banner year for tech stocks.\n\nAfter the Nasdaq Composite jumped 43% in 2023 with an even bigger gain in the Nasdaq-100, the Nasdaq Composite is up 9% in 2024 as the first quarter winds down.\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom is the main reason tech stocks are still soaring, but it's not the only reason behind this sector's booming gains. Keep reading to see three tech stocks that look like great buys right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nYou don't get points for originality in the stock market, and while Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may seem like one of the more obvious choices right now, that doesn't make it a bad buy.\n\nThe tech giant has outfoxed its rivals and emerged as the software leader in AI, at least for now. By partnering with OpenAI, Microsoft has been able to add generative AI technology to a wide range of products, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, GitHub code repository, and Office software suite, and those efforts are already paying off. Management said in the most recent quarter that six points of growth in Azure came from AI services, driving the overall category up 30%, which was much faster than Amazon Web Services.\n\nMicrosoft also just hired DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman from Alphabet, which seems likely to extend its lead in AI. Suleyman also co-founded Inflection AI, which recently folded; Microsoft hired most of its employees.\n\nAdditionally, no other tech giant has the diversification to capitalize on the opportunity in AI.\n\n2. ACM Research\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ: ACMR) is a little-known, small-cap semiconductor company that makes highly specialized wafer-cleaning equipment. These machines play an essential role in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe company sells mostly to customers in China, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which accounted for 16.5% of revenue last year.\n\nLike other semiconductor stocks, ACM has started to see a tailwind from artificial intelligence. The company said that demand for its products was strong in the most recent quarter as it gained market share in the Chinese wafer fab equipment market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue was up 43% and profits surged as well, with adjusted net income more than doubling to $28.7 million. As demand for the advanced chips that artificial intelligence depends on increases, so should demand for ACM's cleaning equipment.\n\nAdditionally, the stock is inexpensive, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 18. This low entry point sets it up for further gains.\n\n3. The Trade Desk\n\nFinally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is another great tech stock to buy right now.\n\nThe Trade Desk is the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the adtech industry. The company provides a self-serve, cloud-based platform for ad agencies and brands to manage their ad campaigns, and it looks set to benefit from a number of trends this year.\n\nFirst, the company is tapping into the power of AI with the launch of its new Kokai AI platform, which leverages deep learning algorithms throughout the digital media buying process, taking advantage of 13 million advertising impressions per second.\n\nAdditionally, The Trade Desk benefits from a recovery in the digital ad market after a lull in 2022 and 2023 on fears of a recession, meaning revenue growth should accelerate from secular tailwinds. Finally, The Trade Desk looks well-positioned to capitalize on Google Chrome's phasing out of third-party cookies, which should help its alternate tracking solution, Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) gain market share. UID2 has already signed up some of the biggest advertisers in the world, including Disney and Procter & Gamble.\n\nThe Trade Desk is also growing rapidly and is highly profitable. The stock has a long track record of outperformance and that trend should continue in the coming years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Hidden Gem: This Underfollowed Top Ranked Stock is Integral to the AI Boom",
        "content": "Although it may seem like Artificial Intelligence stocks are all that\u2019s being talked about these days, the hype is indeed real. AI technology will probably be as significant to the stock market and economy as the internet has been, and the market has been telling us this in bold font.\n\nJust look at this popular basket of AI-adjacent stocks and see how significant the market outperformance has been in the last seven months. Even the lowest performing stock has nearly doubled the returns of the broad market over that time.\n\nI will say some of these stocks have had their valuations pumped up significantly, possibly limiting the near-term upside. Thus, I have been looking for some off-the-beaten-path AI opportunities.\n\nBy utilizing the Zacks Rank, I have identified one such stock that I think may offer huge opportunity over the next few months and years. It is a small cap stock that plays a particularly niche role in the semiconductor industry and is anticipating exceptional growth in the coming years.\n\nRead ahead and learn about ACM Research ACMR. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nACM Research\n\nACM Research is a leading provider of single-wafer wet cleaning equipment, offering innovative solutions for semiconductor manufacturing processes. Founded in 1998, the company specializes in developing, manufacturing, and selling advanced cleaning equipment designed to meet the stringent requirements of the semiconductor industry.\n\nACM's technology enables precise and efficient cleaning of individual silicon wafers, essential for ensuring high-quality semiconductor production.\n\nACM Research also plays a crucial role in the AI industry through its cutting-edge wet cleaning equipment. As AI hardware demands increasingly sophisticated semiconductor components, the need for precise and reliable wafer cleaning solutions becomes paramount. ACM's technology ensures the cleanliness and integrity of semiconductor wafers, contributing to the manufacturing of AI chips with optimal performance and efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy providing essential equipment for semiconductor fabrication, ACM Research indirectly supports the development and advancement of AI technologies, enabling the deployment of powerful AI systems across various applications and industries.\n\nHowever, because this is a little-known company, its influence on the industry is easily overlooked, and thus creates a fantastic opportunity for discerning investors.\n\nNot only does ACMR have this under-the-radar status, but it also enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, impressive growth forecasts, a reasonable valuation, and a compelling technical trading setup.\n\nSales and Earnings\n\nEarnings estimates have rocketed higher over the last month as analysts realize the tailwind AI will provide ACMR\u2019s business. ACM Research also sits in the Top 1% of the Zacks Industry Rank (1 out of 252) and is the only name in the Semiconductor Equipment \u2013 Material Services industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSales at ACM Research have been rising at an exponential pace over the last five years going from just under $100 million annually to more than $550 million in the trailing 12 months. That pace of growth is expected to continue as well with current forecasts expecting 25% YoY growth this year and 26% next year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation\n\nAt this point in time, ACM Research is trading near its five-year low in terms of earnings multiples. Today, it is valued at 18.5x TTM earnings, which is well below the industry average and its five-year median.\n\nBecause ACMR has flown under the radar since the start of the AI boom, its valuation hasn\u2019t been jacked up nearly as much as the other AI adjacent stocks. Thus, investors buying now are getting in a below industry valuation, with multi-year tailwinds at their backs. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnical Setup\n\nFinally, ACM Research stock just broke out from a powerful technical trading setup. After building out a descending bull flag for the last few weeks, price blasted through resistance, and look ready to push to new YTD highs. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor investors looking to add exposure to the Artificial Intelligence theme, while also focusing on a quality, small cap company, ACM Research may very well be your next portfolio addition. Furthermore, it offers the advantage of being little followed and also critical to the industry so you know the business has staying power.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think ACM Research (ACMR) Could Surge 25.24%: Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Shares of ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) have gained 46.7% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $30.19, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $37.81 indicates a potential upside of 25.2%.\n\nThe mean estimate comprises seven short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $2.37. While the lowest estimate of $34 indicates a 12.6% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 32.5% to reach $40. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\n\nHowever, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in ACMR. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.\n\nHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nStory continues\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nWhy ACMR Could Witness a Solid Upside\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 15.1% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.\n\nMoreover, ACMR currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much ACMR could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "1 Small Semiconductor Stock Up 50% in 2024 Alone -- Is It Too Late to Buy?",
        "content": "2024 has gotten off to quite the start. As investors warm up to the idea that a new bull market has begun, interest has flooded into the semiconductor industry, with names like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and their artificial intelligence (AI) system assembler partner Super Micro Computer skyrocketing.\n\nSmall-cap stock ACM Research(NASDAQ: ACMR) has gone wild, too, up 50% so far in 2024 alone and up some 270% since the beginning of 2023 (as of March 6, 2024). The chip manufacturing equipment company has picked up steam on a better-than-expected growth and profit outlook. But can the run continue?\n\nAn odd business model, hidden by a stellar stock chart\n\nThe U.S. has been tightening export controls to China on the most advanced semiconductors used in AI systems, as well as the most advanced equipment used to manufacture said semiconductors. Besides these AI chips, though, there's a world of other types of semiconductors needed for things like electric vehicles and industrial machinery. China has been building its own chip manufacturing industry in support of these more \"mature\" types of not quite cutting-edge chips.\n\nEnter ACM Research (ACMR), which provides critical equipment for chip manufacturing. Specifically, ACMR provides machines that \"clean\" silicon wafers between manufacturing process steps. Everything from power management devices to sensors to more basic logic and memory go through dozens of steps before the silicon wafers are cut up into chips. ACMR can help facilitate nearly all of these steps, regardless of the individual processes for each type of semiconductor.\n\nThe company's sales rocketed 43% higher in 2023 to $558 million, including a 56% year-over-year increase in sales in Q4. That's impressive, given ACMR's equipment type is dominated by industry giants like Lam Research and Tokyo Electron. Management believes revenue will rise as much as another 30% in 2024, and reach a range of $650 million to $725 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut here's where some oddities come into play. Though it's a Silicon Valley-based business, ACMR operates through a majority-owned subsidiary called ACM Shanghai (which had an initial public offering in China a few years ago) that accounts for nearly all of the company's sales. ACMR is quite transparent about this, pointing this fact out at the top of its investor relations homepage.\n\nAt this point, there's no reason to believe that ACMR is skirting U.S. export controls, given that most of its machines are used for those more \"mature\" chips versus those used in AI. Nevertheless, geopolitical risk (or perhaps the threat of it at some point) does pose a particular reason for concern for would-be ACMR investors.\n\nIs it too late to buy this semiconductor stock?\n\nGeopolitical intrigue aside, ACMR is making solid financial progress. Shares trade for 24 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), and just 19 times EPS based on Wall Street's consensus estimates for 2024. For such a fast-growing business, even one that participates in the highly cyclical semiconductor manufacturing space, ACMR looks cheap.\n\nAnd given investor appetite for all things semiconductors right now, it's hard to call a top in stocks like ACMR. The market is eyeing long-term potential for the industry, as China, the U.S., and other countries are all trying to onshore semiconductor manufacturing in the wake of the pandemic. ACMR could be sitting on years of growth as a result.\n\nDo bear in mind that said growth does come at a cost. ACMR has been operating in the red on a free-cash-flow (FCF) basis, as its rapid pace of expansion has it spending cash. Note that generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and EPS are positive because capital expenditures used to calculate FCF are amortized over time. ACMR Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nAt any rate, there are plenty of reasons for optimism for this stock. I'm sitting on my hands given the heightened political uncertainty, but ACM Research is nevertheless a fascinating story to watch unfold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ACM Research right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ACM Research , consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ACM Research wasn\u2019t one of them.

SOFI stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nSoFi\u2019s (NASDAQ:SOFI) tech platform and financial services have solid top-line growth and bottom-line expansion that uplifts the potency of the stock\u2019s valuation. The tech platform segment signifies another considerable growth driver for SoFi as it delivers accelerated top-line growth. Fourth-quarter revenue hit $97 million, up 13% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. This growth trajectory indicates the segment\u2019s increasing market demand, rapid product adoption, and expanding client base.\n\nAdditionally, the tech platform segment demonstrated notable margin expansion, with a contribution margin of 32% for the period, compared to 20% in the previous year. This bottom-line improvement highlights SoFi\u2019s enhanced operational edge, cost management initiatives and scalable business model. The segment continues optimizing its operations and leveraging synergies from recent integrations, strengthening the fintech\u2019s overall bottom-line and long-term valuation growth prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, incremental margin improvement across its business segments reflects SoFi\u2019s ability to scale operations and capitalize on top-line growth opportunities efficiently. Notably, SoFi delivered a\u00a074%\u00a0incremental adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. This improvement suggests the company\u2019s ability at managing costs and maximizing returns on business as it expands its operations.\n\nSoFi also strategically reduced operating expenses as a percentage of adjusted net revenue. Notably, total operating expenses declined approximately\u00a017 points\u00a0as a percentage of adjusted net revenue year-over-year. This shows the company\u2019s focus on disciplined cost management and operational optimization.\n\nFinally, the financial services segment derived solid top-line growth, with net revenue surging 115% year-over-year to $139 million. Critically, the segment achieved a contribution profit of $25 million, marking considerable margin improvement. This suggests the segment\u2019s increasing efficiency and revenue-generating capabilities.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) enjoys a solid market lead based on technological differentiation in semiconductor equipment solutions where it derives its competitiveness.\n\nSemiconductor equipment manufacturer offers one of the broadest cleaning product portfolios in the industry, covering approximately\u00a090% of all cleaning process steps in both memory and logic device applications. This extensive product range enables the company to address diverse customer needs and capture a larger market share.\n\nACM\u2019s proprietary technologies and innovative solutions differentiate its products from competitors. The introduction of advanced cleaning tools, such as the ULTRA\u00a0C Vacuum Cleaning Tool, suggests the company is focusing on tech innovation while addressing emerging industry requirements.\n\nIt\u2019s solid market presence and established client relationships further reinforce ACM\u2019s market lead. The company fosters prolonged ties with its clients through high-quality products and superior customer service. As a result, ACM has a diversified client base with solid footholds in both domestic and international markets.\n\nIn China, the company has widely adopted its products using tools by nearly all semiconductor manufacturing users. The company\u2019s sales and service teams continue to exert effort in expanding the deployment of major product lines across the growing customer base. Similarly, ACM Research\u2019s lead into international markets, including the US, Europe and other parts of Asia, suggest it is looking for an expanded global footprint.\n\nFinally, gross margins were\u00a052.9%, a 350 basis point increase from a year ago. It handily exceeded the expected range of 40% to 45%. This improvement is attributed to a favorable product mix, cost efficiencies, and positive currency impacts. Therefore, higher gross margins led to increased profitability and boosted valuations.\n\nDespegar (DESP) A photo of an excited woman riding on the back of a bike a man is driving.\n\nSource: OPOLJA / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespegar (NYSE:DESP) operates in the underpenetrated Latin American travel market, an estimated $150 billion opportunity. With a focus on online and offline segments, Despegar targets capturing a higher market share by leveraging its tech edge and market expertise.\n\nNotably, the company\u2019s gross bookings may exceed $5 billion this year, with a considerable portion originating from the business-to-consumer (B2C) channel. Fundamentally, by matching the diverse demand base and offering a wide range of travel services, Despegar may sustain its solid growth momentum and expand its market presence in Latin America.\n\nFurthermore, Despegar strategically focuses on\u00a0multiple channels. This provides a solid grip on different Latin American travel market segments. Notably, the B2C channel is a major driver of growth. However, the company is also expanding its business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) channels to hit the target market more deeply.\n\nIn the long term, Despegar has established itself as a leader in tech within the Latin American travel industry. The company\u2019s focus on leveraging cutting-edge technologies (such as generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models) has enabled it to boost customer experiences and optimize operations. For example, an AI trip planner and the integration of WhatsApp were introduced based on an app-first approach.\n\nFurthermore, Despegar\u2019s app-first approach has led to a surge in app-based transactions. Over 40% of total transactions were app-based. Theoretically, by prioritizing mobile platforms and investing in app development, the company may reach a wider audience, improve user experiences, and derive engagement.\n\nFinally, Despegar\u2019s focus on customer loyalty programs (with nearly\u00a020 million loyalty program members) may serve as solid support for its valuation ascension.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in SOFI and ACMR.

        "content": "The Russell 2000, an index tracking the performance of small- to mid-cap companies, has not had a good start to 2024. So far, the Russell is trading flat while the S&P500 and Nasdaq have appreciated 6.26% and 8.51%, respectively since equities trading began this year. However, with many Russell 2000 stocks down, this may be the time for investors to begin allocating to stocks with the best potential to deliver solid returns.\n\nWithout further ado, here are three Russell 2000 stocks that could make your February unforgettable.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) was the first pure-play\u00a0among publicly traded quantum computing stocks, and the company has become the leader in trapped-ion quantum computing. This subsect of quantum computing uses electrically charged atoms to store and manipulate qubits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo date, the company claims to have built the world\u2019s\u00a0most powerful quantum computer which has achieved a quantum capacity 32 qubits.\u00a0IonQ plans to launch modular quantum computers by the end of 2023. To make the computing power of its quantum computers more accessible, IonQ has made its quantum computing power accessible to customers and developers through large cloud platforms.\n\nIonQ\u2019s shares are down almost 2% on a YTD, which could make a good entry point for new investors or investors willing to increase their investment. Quantum computing, similar to generative AI, has the potential to be the next big thing in technology, and IonQ is at the forefront of the space.\n\nOnto Innovation (ONTO) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news. Russell 2000 Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOnto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO) designs and manufactures metrology and inspection tools for the semiconductor industry. As the semiconductor space has increased in importance and size, Onto and other semiconductor equipment manufacturers have been able to capitalize on this new demand and boost revenue figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past four years, Onto Innovation has\u00a0managed to deliver double-digit revenue growth. While the chip slump has begun to eat into growth in 2023, the company still has amazing prospects, especially as the chip slump comes to an end. Shares have catapulted more than 150% in 2023, and the stock is off to a great start in 2024, having already risen over 20%.\n\nChip manufacturers including TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung projected an end to the chip slump this year, and higher demand from semiconductor companies could help boost earnings for Onto Innovation in the long run.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website. Russell 2000 Stocks\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is another semiconductor equipment manufacturer, and one of the more promising Russell 2000 stocks. This one in particular supplies semiconductor manufacturers with wet processing equipment and technologies. ACM Research has a particular focus on China\u2019s domestic semiconductor market. This can provide an opportunity for long term growth as the sector continues to make advances in technological capabilities.\n\nACM Research\u2019s earnings results throughout 2023 were admittedly impressive and beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates. As a result, ACM\u2019s share price skyrocketed more than 153% in 2023. However, we should not divorce ACMR\u2019s performance from China\u2019s economic recovery. They\u2019re intrinsically related, and further hiccups in the way in which China\u2019s government handles the ongoing economic slowdown does spur volatility into ACM Research\u2019s share price. Shares in the semiconductor equipment stock have fallen more than 6% since the start of trading in January.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s relatively cheap multiples could help revive performance in the near and medium term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Russell 2000 Stocks with Strong Buy Ratings",
        "content": "The\u00a0Russell 2000, an index tracking the performance of small-to-mid-cap companies, ended 2023 in better shape than when it started. In particular, Russell 2000 stocks 16.8% in 2023, below that of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, which appreciated 24.2% and 43.4%, respectively. Outside of just tracking some pretty obscure companies that tended to underperform, the Russell 2000 was also undoubtedly shaken by the U.S. banking crisis in March. The index had been trailing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since then.\n\nStill, a new year has come, and there are some stocks worth looking at in the Russell 2000, several of which Wall Street is even excited about. Below are three names.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a leading supplier of wet processing equipment and technologies for the semiconductor industry. What makes ACM Research unique is its focus on the China semiconductor market. While some may see this as a weakness, what investors should recognize is that China\u2019s semiconductor space has come a long way and has even surprised U.S. policy makers in its resilience. In turns out attempting to make playing field lopsided only made China\u2019s domestic industry more competitive. Companies supplying manufacturing machinery to this burgeoning semiconductor sector could benefit tremendously in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research\u2019s earnings results throughout 2023 were admittedly impressive and beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates. As a result, ACM\u2019s share price skyrocketed more than 153% in 2023. In the current calendar year, ACM\u2019s stock price has begun to trend downward, but I think investors should view this as a potential buying opportunity, as ACMR\u2019s valuation still looks cheap. In particular, the company\u2019s enterprise value to EBITDA ratio trades around 9.5x forward EBITDA.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) MICROSTRATEGY - sign at headquarters building. MSTR stock.\n\nSource: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) had made one or two of my \u201csell\u201d lists in 2023. My point was that the company\u2019s valuation was too dependent upon the fluctuating price of bitcoin. For those who don\u2019t know, while MicroStrategy is a software company that specializes in business intelligence and analytics, helping improve\u00a0the efficiency of users\u2019 workflows,\u00a0the company is better known for its large Bitcoin portfolio.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has appreciated 346% in 2023, and a lot of that performance mimicked\u00a0Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surge. The famed cryptocurrency had a great run last year, a lot of which had to do with bets on the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Wall Street still seems happy with the stock. Wall Street analysts have given MSTR a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, and the average 12-month price target implies there is at least a 21% gain from the current share price.\n\nDHT Holdings (DHT) Crude oil tanker and LPG Loading in port at sea view from above.

Oil prices, oil shipping, oil stocks.\n\nSource: Avigator Fortuner / Shutterstock.com\n\nShipping stocks are likely to benefit from a huge windfall in 2024, and DHT Holdings (NYSE:DHT) is likely to be one of these beneficiaries. DHT, in particular, is a leading oil tanker company with a fleet of 21 very large crude carriers (VLCCs) that can each carry up to 2 million barrels of oil. The company had spent the latter half of 2023 benefitting from higher \u201cton-miles\u201d due to strong demand from East Asian countries, particularly from China, and the need to source crude from the United States, Brazil and Guyana as Russia and Middle Eastern petrostates pursued supply cuts.\n\nAnother factor that will play into DHT\u2019s earnings potential in 2024, is this Red Sea debacle. Yemen-based Houthi rebels have made effective attacks on ships going through the channel. The United States and the United Kingdom have reacted by bombing \u201cHouthi targets\u201d in Yemen. So far, this has not led to a safer Red Sea or global trade stabilization. Many shipping companies have directed their vessels to take the long way in order to reach Europe. Moreover, these kinds of asymmetric geopolitical conflicts are not likely to be resolved with simple solutions. In fact, the Red Sea blockage could go on for months.\n\nUltimately, while upsetting for consumers, shipping companies are likely to make a killing off of these geopolitical tensions. And shipping companies like DHT that give dividends to their shareholders could very well use their cash flow windfall to gift investors with a \u201cspecial dividend,\u201d juicing investor returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.
