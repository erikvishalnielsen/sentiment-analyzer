        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Toyota Motor Corp. TM, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, Chubb Ltd. CB and Pro-Dex, Inc. PDEX.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Toyota, Lockheed Martin and Chubb\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Toyota Motor Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Chubb Ltd., as well as a micro-cap stock Pro-Dex, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nToyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+12.4% vs. -11.1%). The company\u2019s robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles is set to fuel sales. To capitalize on the global shift to environment-friendly vehicles, the auto giant is deepening its focus on manufacturing electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company\u2019s product competitiveness.\r\n\r\nToyota Motor aims to expand global sales of BEVs to 1.5 million units in 2026 and 3.5 million units a year by 2030. Toyota\u2019s commitment to maximize shareholders value via dividends and buyback is also praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, labor cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on margins. Rising debt levels, along with high R&D expenses and capex, are set to play spoilsport. Also, Toyota expects sales in Japan to decrease, given the lower shipments of Daihatsu. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance now.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+19.1% vs. -4.4%). The company ended second-quarter 2024 on a solid note, with both its earnings and revenues surpassing their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which, in turn, boosts its backlog count.\r\n\r\nLockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact Lockheed\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nChubb\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+36.2% vs. +25.2%). The company\u2019s suite of compelling products as well as services, focus on capitalizing on the potential of middle-market businesses and investments in various strategic initiatives pave the way for long-term growth.\r\n\r\nSeveral distribution agreements have expanded its network, boosting its market presence. An impressive inorganic growth story helps to achieve a higher long-term return on equity. Chubb expects adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.63 billion per quarter in 2024.\r\n\r\nChubb boasts a strong capital position with sufficient cash generation capabilities that ensure steady payouts to investors. Second quarter EPS beat estimates. However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses weigh on margin expansion.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Chubb here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Pro-Dex have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $69.48 million has demonstrated strong financial performance, with net sales increasing 10% year over year to $38.8 million for the nine months ended Mar 31, 2024, reflecting robust demand.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a new 25,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Tustin, CA, boosts production capacity and supports future growth. Strategic alliances, such as a supply agreement with Monogram Orthopaedics, enhance market reach and revenue potential. Pro-Dex's strong balance sheet, with $3.2 million in cash and $5.2 million in operating cash flow, ensures financial stability.\r\n\r\nStrong customer relationships, with repeat business from major customers accounting for 85% of net sales, provide a stable revenue stream. However, customer concentration risk, limited market diversification, high operating expenses and competitive pressures are notable headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Pro-Dex here >>>)\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Best Buy Co., Inc. BBY, The AES Corp. AES, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and Banco de Chile BCH.\n\n5 High ROE Stocks to Bet On as Markets Seek Rate Cut Clarity\n\nThe broader U.S. equity markets witnessed a modest uptrend over the past few trading days, buoyed by optimism related to rate cuts driven by easing inflationary pressures and solid economic metrics that portrayed the resilience of the economy. In addition, a relatively healthy earnings performance from hitherto reported companies ignited hopes of a possible rate cut as early as September.\n\nThe markets now await the Federal Reserve\u2019s update on the monetary policy as it wraps up its policy meeting later today. Although the Fed is widely expected to keep the benchmark funds rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, investors are seeking cues for probable cuts in the near future. With a better-than-expected 2.8% annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and a robust labor market scenario, the conditions appear primed to heed the broader sentiments.\n\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \u201cbacking and filling\u201d in the market, they can benefit from \u201ccash cow\u201d stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Best Buy Co., Inc., The AES Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp., PulteGroup, Inc. and Banco de Chile are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nWhy ROE?\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\n\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management\u2019s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nHere are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nBest Buy: Headquartered in Richfield, MN, Best Buy is a multinational specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, communication, food preparation, wellness, health, security, appliances and related services. The company retails technology products in the United States and Canada.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5.1% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11%, on average.

        "title": "Top Stock Reports for Toyota, Lockheed Martin &amp; Chubb",
        "content": "Wednesday, July 31, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Toyota Motor Corp. (TM), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and Chubb Ltd. (CB), as well as a micro-cap stock Pro-Dex, Inc. (PDEX). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nToyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+12.4% vs. -11.1%). The company\u2019s robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles is set to fuel sales. To capitalize on the global shift to environment-friendly vehicles, the auto giant is deepening its focus on manufacturing electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company\u2019s product competitiveness.\r\n\r\nToyota Motor aims to expand global sales of BEVs to 1.5 million units in 2026 and 3.5 million units a year by 2030. Toyota\u2019s commitment to maximize shareholders value via dividends and buyback is also praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, labor cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on margins. Rising debt levels, along with high R&D expenses and capex, are set to play spoilsport. Also, Toyota expects sales in Japan to decrease, given the lower shipments of Daihatsu. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance now.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+19.1% vs. -4.4%). The company ended second-quarter 2024 on a solid note, with both its earnings and revenues surpassing their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which, in turn, boosts its backlog count.\r\n\r\nLockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact Lockheed\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nChubb\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+36.2% vs. +25.2%). The company\u2019s suite of compelling products as well as services, focus on capitalizing on the potential of middle-market businesses and investments in various strategic initiatives pave the way for long-term growth.\r\n\r\nSeveral distribution agreements have expanded its network, boosting its market presence. An impressive inorganic growth story helps to achieve a higher long-term return on equity. Chubb expects adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.63 billion per quarter in 2024.\r\n\r\nChubb boasts a strong capital position with sufficient cash generation capabilities that ensure steady payouts to investors. Second quarter EPS beat estimates. However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses weigh on margin expansion.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Chubb here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Pro-Dex have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $69.48 million has demonstrated strong financial performance, with net sales increasing 10% year over year to $38.8 million for the nine months ended Mar 31, 2024, reflecting robust demand.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a new 25,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Tustin, CA, boosts production capacity and supports future growth. Strategic alliances, such as a supply agreement with Monogram Orthopaedics, enhance market reach and revenue potential. Pro-Dex's strong balance sheet, with $3.2 million in cash and $5.2 million in operating cash flow, ensures financial stability.\r\n\r\nStrong customer relationships, with repeat business from major customers accounting for 85% of net sales, provide a stable revenue stream. However, customer concentration risk, limited market diversification, high operating expenses and competitive pressures are notable headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Pro-Dex here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Honeywell International (HON), American Electric Power (AEP) and The Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "McDonald's downgraded, PayPal upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nBernstein upgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $78, up from $71. The firm is encouraged by improved transaction gross profit performance from the company's positive branded growth, Braintree pricing initiatives, and Venmo monetization. BofA upgraded Lockheed Martin(LMT) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $635, up from $465. Lockheed's upgraded F-35s with Tech Refresh-3 packages have restarted deliveries, notes the firm, which views the company as poised to outperform on strong global demand across segments as it anticipates Lockheed benefiting from ramping programs like the PAC-3, HIMARS, JASSM, and LRASM. BofA upgraded Ecolab (ECL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $272, up from $251. The shares sold off following Ecolab's 35% earnings growth in Q2 on 4% organic sales, but the firm found the results \"constructive\" and has increased conviction that Ecolab can generate mid-teens earnings growth in the coming years along with expanding operating margins. Citi also upgraded Ecolab to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $265, down from $267. BofA upgraded RTX (RTX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $110. As the Geared Turbo Fan, or GTF, fix is ongoing, the firm is now more confident the scale and scope of the fix has been fairly considered by the company and sees potential for further derisking as Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul, or MRO, throughput increased 10% quarter-over-quarter with more shops coming online. Mizuho double upgraded Upstart (UPST) to Outperform from Underperform with a price target of $31, up from $17. The company \"doesn't have many fans\" with short interest at 33% and zero sell-side buy ratings, but the firm says the growing likelihood of lower interest rates, improving borrower risk, lower delinquencies and positive industry commentary \"are all signs that the skies might be brightening,\" allowing Upstart to \"re-open the credit box and increase issuance of loans.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nTD Cowen downgraded McDonald's(MCD) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $280, down from $285. The firm says the positive stock reaction to the company's \"challenged\" Q2 results and \"soft\" second half of 2024 outlook presents a balanced risk/reward over the next 12-months. Benchmark downgraded IPG Photonics(IPGP) to Hold from Buy with no price target after the company posted June-end quarter results that were in line with prior guidance, but gave a forecast for the September-ed quarter that was well below investor expectations. Wolfe Research downgraded Charter (CHTR) to Peer Perform from Outperform. The company's EBITDA trends proved resilient amid peak disruption, but its price and cost-driven strategy warrants a low multiple, the firm tells investors in a research note. Craig-Hallum downgraded Grocery Outlet (GO) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $20, down from $32. The firm says its checks over the past two months indicate a deceleration in same-store sales since May that creates potential downside to Q2/Q3 estimates. Citi downgraded Penumbra (PEN) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $178, up from $165. The company's strong quarter was accompanied by a cut to 2024 revenue guidance \"that was multi-factorial,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nRaymond James initiated coverage of On Holding(ONON) with an Outperform rating and $46 price target. The firm expects strong demand and operating margin expansion to drive annual growth of over 25% for revenue, over 30% for EBITDA, and over 50% for earnings through 2026. Benchmark initiated coverage of Blink Charging (BLNK) with a Buy rating and $5 price target. Blink Charging, which manufactures, sells, and owns/operates primarily level 2 networked electric vehicle charging equipment, is \"well-positioned\" with a focus on Level 2 chargers, which is expected to be 90% of the market, the firm tells investors. William Blair initiated coverage of Applied Therapeutics(APLT) with an Outperform rating. The firm says Applied Therapeutics is an \"under-the-radar company\" developing a \"nice mix\" of therapeutics targeting rare diseases and some larger indications with potential for several major value inflections over the next 12 months. Raymond James initiated coverage of Black Diamond Therapeutics(BDTX) with an Outperform rating and $20 price target. The firm sees the potential for BDTX-1535 to potently target a broad spectrum of Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate mutations in non-small cell lung cancer that are inadequately addressed by current standard of care, including non-classical EGFR mutations, osimertinib resistance mutations, and the L855R classical mutation, the firm tells investors in a research note. Truist initiated coverage of Nurix Therapeutics(NRIX) with a Buy rating and $36 price target. The firm says the company's lead drug, NX-5948, has potential to be best-in-class Bruton's tyrosine kinase degrader and may be used in B-cell cancers, a multi-billion market.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Institutional investors have a lot riding on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) with 74% ownership",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Lockheed Martin's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 7 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have been selling lately\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 7.3% last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 22% and last week\u2019s gain was the icing on the cake.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lockheed Martin, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lockheed Martin. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lockheed Martin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Lockheed Martin. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc. with 15% of shares outstanding. With 11% and 9.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, Lockheed Martin Corporation, ESOP and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nWe also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that Lockheed Martin Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$70m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "5 High ROE Stocks to Bet on as Markets Seek Rate Cut Clarity",
        "content": "The broader U.S. equity markets witnessed a modest uptrend over the past few trading days, buoyed by optimism related to rate cuts driven by easing inflationary pressures and solid economic metrics that portrayed the resilience of the economy. In addition, a relatively healthy earnings performance from hitherto reported companies ignited hopes of a possible rate cut as early as September.\r\n\r\nThe markets now await the Federal Reserve\u2019s update on the monetary policy as it wraps up its policy meeting later today. Although the Fed is widely expected to keep the benchmark funds rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, investors are seeking cues for probable cuts in the near future. With a better-than-expected 2.8% annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and a robust labor market scenario, the conditions appear primed to heed the broader sentiments.\r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \u201cbacking and filling\u201d in the market, they can benefit from \u201ccash cow\u201d stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Best Buy Co., Inc. BBY, The AES Corporation AES, Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and Banco de Chile BCH are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nWhy ROE?\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management\u2019s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nParameters Used for Screening\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.\r\n\r\nReturn on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.\r\n\r\n5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nBest Buy: Headquartered in Richfield, MN, Best Buy is a multinational specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, communication, food preparation, wellness, health, security, appliances and related services. The company retails technology products in the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5.1% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11%, on average. It has a VGM Score of B. Best Buy carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nAES: Arlington, VA-based AES is a global power company. Its businesses are spread across four continents in 14 countries. The company has four Strategic Business Units located in the United States and other regions across the globe. AES remains one of the forerunners in the utility industry's transition to clean energy by investing in sustainable growth and innovative solutions while delivering superior results.\r\n\r\nIt delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.8%, on average. AES carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has a VGM Score of A.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. Its main areas of focus are defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. Lockheed Martin currently operates through four businesses \u2014 Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Missions Systems and Space Systems. \r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 4.2% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.5%, on average. Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nPulteGroup: Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments \u2013 Homebuilding and Financial Services. The company engages in maintaining a 50/50 balance between build-to-order and spec sales, enabling it to meet immediate demand with spec homes while also accommodating buyers who prefer to customize their homes with build-to-order options.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 19% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10%, on average. It has a VGM Score of B. PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #2. \r\n\r\nBanco de Chile: Headquartered in Santiago, Chile, Banco de Chile provides various banking services to customers in the Latin American country.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +13.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has gained 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nLockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.40 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.34 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.3%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.68 indicates a change of +8.9% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $70.42 billion and $73.24 billion estimates indicate +4.2% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $7.11 for the same period compares with $6.73 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.88%. The EPS surprise was +10.23%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "These 3 Companies Posted Robust Quarterly Results",
        "content": "Earnings season continues to chug along, with this week\u2019s reporting docket notably busy. So far, the period has been solid, with overall earnings growth for the S&P 500 on track to be positive for another period.\n\nSo far, there have been several notable reports, including those from Lockheed Martin LMT, Deckers Outdoor DECK, and 3M MMM. Shares of each popped following their quarterly results, with each posting strong results.\n\nFor those interested in post-earnings momentum, let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Raises Outlook\n\nDeckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports, and other lifestyle-related activities.\n\nThe company posted a double beat, with earnings and revenue growing 87% and 22%, respectively. Continued brand momentum among UGG and Hoka shoes aided the robust results, leading the company to up its current fiscal year outlook.\n\nAnalysts have updated their outlook for the company\u2019s current fiscal year accordingly following the print, with the $31.33 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has also been enjoying margin expansion, aiding its profitability picture nicely. And it enjoyed the same throughout its latest release, with its gross margin expanding to 56.9% vs 51.3% in the year-ago period.\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLockheed Martin Posts Robust Cash Flow\n\nLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, operating in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology. The company\u2019s steady growth continued throughout its latest period, with EPS and revenue growing 6% and 9%, respectively.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s sales on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCEO Jim Taiclet was pleased with the results, stating, \u2018First quarter sales increased significantly year-over-year and we generated robust free cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion, while taking assertive actions to further strengthen production capacity. In addition, we continued our disciplined and dynamic capital deployment by investing over $700 million into R&D and capital projects and returned significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to delivering meaningful free cash flow per share growth over the long-term.\u2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has been a long-time favorite among income-focused investors, upping its payout consistently over its history. LMT\u2019s cash-generating abilities have aided the dividend growth, providing it with its shareholder-friendly nature. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n3M Enjoys Profitability Boost\n\n3M operates as a diversified technology firm with four reportable segments: Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. Share got a boost following its quarterly release, with the company posting 40% Y/Y EPS growth.\n\nPerhaps to the surprise of some, shares are up a staggering 60% over the last six months, with both of its recent prints providing post-earnings positivity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company adjusted its current year outlook thanks to the results, now expecting adjusted EPS in a band of $7.00 - $7.30 per share ($6.80 - $7.30 per share previously). Like LMT, the company\u2019s long been shareholder-friendly, returning $786 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks throughout the period.\n\nMargin pressures have weighed heavily on shares but have recently shown signs of stabilization, as we can see below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season continues to chug along, with a stacked reporting docket for this week specifically. We\u2019ve seen many positive surprises so far, including those from Lockheed Martin LMT, Deckers Outdoor DECK, and 3M MMM.\n\nMore surprises are sure to come.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "HII or LMT: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "Investors interested in Aerospace - Defense stocks are likely familiar with Huntington Ingalls (HII) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nRight now, Huntington Ingalls is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Lockheed Martin has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that HII's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nHII currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.89, while LMT has a forward P/E of 19.94. We also note that HII has a PEG ratio of 2.36. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.70.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for HII is its P/B ratio of 2.64. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, LMT has a P/B of 20.26.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help HII earn a Value grade of B, while LMT has been given a Value grade of C.\n\nHII sticks out from LMT in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that HII is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This article looks at the country that has the best military in the world. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 15 Countries That Have the Best Military in the World.\n\nGlobal Defense Spending\n\nFigures released this\u00a0April by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated global defense spending for 2023 at a record high of\u00a0$2.44 trillion, having risen 6.8% compared to the previous year. This is the biggest spike in military expenditure since 2009 and the ninth successive year defense spending had increased.\n\nWith defense bills worth a whopping $916 billion during the year, the United States accounted for 37.5% of the world\u2019s total military spending in 2023. The figure was 2.3% higher than last year and represented more than two-thirds (68%) of NATO\u2019s overall defense expenditure in 2023. $588 billion was spent in Europe, which was 16% higher than in 2022, and made up 24% of the global spending. The spike was triggered by a substantial increase in defense spending by both Russia and Ukraine, while several other countries in the region also bolstered their defenses with war returning to the continent after decades of peace.\n\nAsia incurred $560 billion on defense in 2023. The figure was 40% more than what it was a decade ago in 2014. A major chunk of this expenditure came from East Asia and South Asia, while oil-rich monarchies in the Middle East also spent hefty amounts on strengthening their national security.\n\nThe surge in defense spending over the last two years, specifically after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has created a boom in the global defense industry. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East involving Israel and Hamas has further bolstered their finances. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) posted a revenue of $67.6 billion in 2023, representing a 2.4% increase year-over-year. The company\u2019s earnings also grew $1.2 billion compared to 2023.\n\nSince the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s share price has gained 29%, due to strong demand for its weapons, especially HIMARS, GMLRS, and the F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet. The stock is projected for further growth with no end in sight to the war in Europe and the aggravating situation in the Middle East. In April, this year, the United States announced $95 billion in fresh military aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Experts believe a major chunk of this amount is going to go into the procurement of advanced weapons from companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). It is one of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy now, with 47 hedge funds bullish about the company\u2019s prospects in Q1 2024, according to Insider Monkey.\n\nStory continues\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is another stock that is flying high amid strong financial results. After a solid 2023, during which it posted nearly $69 billion in revenue, the company had a robust first quarter of 2024 as well, with sales totaling $19.3 billion and registering a 12% YoY growth. Its earnings per share of $1.34 was also 10% higher than in the first quarter of last year. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s share price has spiked 15% since the start of the Ukraine war in early 2022.\n\nAnticipating a sustained demand for its weapons, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) expects a total revenue between $78-99 billion for FY2024 and an EPS in the range of $5.25 \u2013 $5.40. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge funds database, 62 hedge funds are bullish on the company. Their optimism stems from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s impressive backlog of $196 billion, of which $78 billion is related to defense orders, including a $2.8 billion guided-missile order by NATO.\n\nYou can read about other best-performing stocks in the industry by heading over to our recent article on the\u00a010 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Now. The Country with the Best Military in the World\n\nPhoto by Joel Rivera-Camacho on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nWe considered 14 weighted metrics to rank\u00a015 countries that have the best military in the world. These include GDP and defense spending (20%), technological capabilities (15%), manpower and special forces strength (15%), nuclear weapons (10%), aircraft including fighter jets (10%), aircraft carriers and submarines (10%), tanks and artillery (5%), military satellites in orbit (5%), overseas military bases (5%), and cybersecurity capabilities (5%).\n\nIt was seen where each country ranked on a given metric and then was assigned a weighted score accordingly. Finally, all weighted scores were aggregated to get an overall score.\u00a0Countries with the best military in the world\u00a0are ranked in ascending order of their overall weighted scores.\n\nData on GDP was sourced from the IMF, while SIPRI was consulted for numbers related to defense spending. For other military-related metrics, we referred to our recent articles such as 20 Largest Air Forces in the World Heading into 2024, 15 Countries with the Most Battle Tanks in the World, Artillery Strength by Country: Top 20 Militaries, 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World, amongst others,\u00a0the Global Firepower Index 2024; and Power Atlas. For technological advancement levels, we referenced the Global Innovation Index 2023.\n\nThe country with the best military in the world is the United States.\n\n1. United States\n\nGDP (2023): $26.95 trillion\n\nDefense Expenditure (2023): $916 billion\n\nTechnological Capabilities Rank: 3\n\nNuclear Weapons: 5,550\n\nManpower: 1,328,000\n\nSpecial Forces Rank: 1\n\nTanks: 4,657\n\nArtillery: 3,556\n\nAircraft/Fighter Jets: 5,209\n\nAircraft Carriers: 11\n\nSubmarines: 64\n\nMilitary Satellites: 218\n\nOverseas Military Bases: 759\n\nCyber capabilities Rank: 1\n\nWeighted Score: 1.65\n\nThe United States has the best military in the world. The country outranks all counterparts in ground forces, aerial, and naval strength. In 2023, Washington spent a staggering $916 billion on defense expenditure, which represented close to two-fifths of the world\u2019s military spending and 68% of NATO\u2019s defense expenditure during the year. The United States has the largest fleet of fighter jets and aircraft carriers in the world, which alone is a testament to its military power. Moreover, the country enjoys a distinct geographic advantage through its 759 overseas military bases across 80 countries, which allow it to strike enemy targets anywhere in the world at will. The United States is also the third most technologically advanced country in the world and ranks first in the globe for cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nTo learn about other strong militaries, you can check out our detailed report 15 Countries That Have the Best Military in the World.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from best militaries to other business aspects in the industry; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "5 Dividend Stocks to Buy Even if You Are Worried About a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Buying stocks if you're worried about a stock market sell-off sounds counterintuitive. After all, why put your hard-earned money into something if it will lose value?\n\nHistorically, investing during corrections (drawdowns of at least 10%) and bear markets (drawdowns of at least 20%) has been a winning decision. Companies that pay dividends provide an added incentive to endure periods of heightened volatility.\n\nHere's why Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT), Waste Management(NYSE: WM), Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP), and United Parcel Service(NYSE: UPS) are five companies that are built to last and can reward investors with passive income no matter what the overall stock market is doing. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola is close to a flawless dividend stock. It has paid and raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. It also has a sizable yield at 3%, considerably higher than the S&P 500's yield of 1.3%, or 1.7% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMost importantly, it has a recession-resistant business model. Its portfolio comprises soft drinks, coffee, tea, juice, sparking water, and energy drinks -- all relatively low-cost staples. Consumer behavior varies, but in general these are the types of products that enjoy steady demand no matter what the economy is doing.\n\nCoke has been a market-underperforming stock for years, but there is reason to believe it is turning the corner and could accelerate its earnings growth. That turnaround could take time, although an attractive dividend adds a worthwhile incentive to be patient and let an investment thesis play out.\n\nIt's one of the reasons Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has held the stock for over 30 years and why Coke remains a great buy now.\n\n2. Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin operates in a completely different industry than Coke, but the defense contractor has a similar investment proposition.\n\nIt does virtually all of its business with the U.S. government and, to a lesser extent, with approved U.S. allies. A reliable customer base and a massive backlog make Lockheed's cash flows predictable, which helps with budgeting expenses and dividend payments.\n\nThe following chart sums up the business well: steady sales growth, a range-bound operating margin in the low to mid double percentages, and annual dividend raises. It has increased its payout for 21 consecutive years and currently yields 2.5%. LMT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe stodgy nature of the defense industry typically results in discounted valuations, even for the top players. Sure enough, Lockheed's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just 17.4, which is close to the 10-year median P/E of 17.8.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdd it all up, and Lockheed is an ultra-reliable dividend-paying value stock that can do perfectly fine no matter what the market is doing.\n\n3. Waste Management\n\nUnlike many dividend stacks that have lagged behind the growth-stock-fueled rally, WM (as Waste Management refers to itself) has been a strong performer and is hovering around an all-time high.\n\nThe company's business model is beautifully simple. WM collects, transports, and processes trash and recycling materials for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. It also invests in lower-carbon efforts, such as converting landfill gas that forms from the decomposition of organic matter in landfills into pipeline-quality natural gas.\n\nWM tends to do better in periods of expansion as industrial and commercial consumers produce more goods and, therefore, have more waste. But it should still be considered a recession-resistant business because cash flows are largely based on long-term contracts, and there's a need for its services regardless of the economy.\n\nFor example, WM has switched most of its recycling business to fee-for-service, which helps protect against changes in commodity prices.\n\nThe biggest downside is the stock's valuation. It has more than doubled over the last four years, while the dividend is up less than 40%. Anytime a stock's price outpaces the dividend growth, the yield will come down, which is why WM now yields just 1.4%.\n\nEven by estimated earnings, WM is a pricey stock, with a forward P/E of 30.5. However, it will likely be just fine if there is an economic slowdown and a stock market sell-off. It's a company you can count on to endure volatility, but only if you're OK with the premium valuation.\n\n4. Union Pacific\n\nUnion Pacific is one of the largest railroads in North America. Focusing on the western two-thirds of the U.S., the high-margin cash cow is instrumental in transporting goods at low cost.\n\nAlthough railroad stocks are considered cyclical, the industry is essentially an oligopoly, given its high barriers to entry and capital-intensive nature. But it's not an oligopoly in the same way that FedEx and UPS are, or Coke and PepsiCo, because there's no direct competition among all the railroads. For example, CSX and Norfolk Southern focus mainly on the eastern third of the U.S.\n\nThe closest competitor to Union Pacific is Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF, but even then, railroads operate different networks and don't serve the exact same regions.\n\nAnother advantage of railroads is that they own their infrastructure, so expenses are mainly going toward labor and upkeep rather than building entirely new routes.\n\nUnion Pacific might see a slowdown during an economic downturn, but you can rest easy knowing the business model is built for the long term. It has a reasonable 23.3 P/E and raised its quarterly dividend to $1.34 per share earlier this month, representing a forward yield of 2.2%.\n\n5. UPS\n\nUPS hit a new 52-week low after reporting disappointing results. Package delivery volumes are down, and costs are up. That has taken a sledgehammer to the company's growth trajectory and wiped away the momentum it enjoyed in the earlier part of the pandemic.\n\nUPS reset expectations during its 2024 Investor and Analyst Day, charting a path toward achievable three-year targets. The stock has gone essentially nowhere since that presentation in March, and it wouldn't be surprising if it continued to languish in the short term. But in the long term, the business is simply too good to ignore.\n\nManagement is investing heavily in improvements and innovations, including artificial intelligence, to help drive margin growth. It is boosting its healthcare services to target a specific customer base with time- and temperature-sensitive shipments.\n\nWith a mere 21 P/E and a whopping 5.1% yield, UPS stands out as a worthwhile buy-and-hold candidate for investors looking to jolt their passive income streams even if there's a stock market sell-off.\n\nRock-solid stocks to buy now\n\nWhen considering a stock market sell-off, investors might gravitate solely toward ultra-safe choices like Coke, Lockheed Martin, or WM. All three businesses are certainly worth investing in, but cyclical companies with inexpensive valuations and growing dividends -- like Union Pacific and UPS -- can also be good buys.\n\nThe most important quality to look for when investing is a company's ability to deliver on shareholder expectations well into the future. For dividend-paying companies, that means growing earnings to support higher dividend growth, maintaining a competitive edge, and cultivating a strong balance sheet. In sum, all five of these companies are industry-leading businesses that are well positioned to endure a downturn or even take market share and emerge stronger.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Britain\u2019s F-35s could be consigned to the scrap heap",
        "content": "Work on the F-35 fighter jet has morphed into the most expensive weapons programme in history - SAC Tim Laurence/MoD\n\nAs the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales sailed for the biggest Nato exercise since the Cold War, strapped to its flight deck were a clutch of the West\u2019s most advanced fighter jets.\n\nThe American-made F-35 Lightning planes deployed that March are among the newest additions to UK air power at a time when global tensions are rising.\n\nDescribed as \u201cflying computers\u201d, they are packed with sensors and masked by cutting-edge stealth technology to help pilots penetrate deep into hostile territory for devastating strikes and intelligence gathering.\n\nYet the F-35\u2019s journey to deployment has been far from straightforward.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe jets, assembled in the US by Lockheed Martin, have been plagued by repeated delays and cost overruns, while the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has long been evasive about how many Britain will ultimately buy \u2013 and which service will own them.\n\nNow, as the new Labour Government carries out a sweeping defence review, critics have suggested that the UK could seek to halt its purchases to save money.\n\nIt comes amid a separate row over the homegrown next-generation stealth-fighter programme, Tempest, of which Sir Keir Starmer has refused to guarantee the future.\n\nBut extricating the Government from the Tempest programme, which is underpinned by a treaty with partner nations Japan and Italy, will be far trickier politically than cutting F-35s, critics argue.\n\nFrancis Tusa, an independent defence analyst, says the fact the F-35 programme is not under the direct control of the UK will also count against it.\n\nCompared to Tempest, \u201cthe F-35 is very much a less capable, flawed platform, with a quite stormy future, full of uncertainty\u201d, he says.\n\n\u201cSure, there isn\u2019t yet a flying Tempest. But the three partners are in control of their destinies with it \u2013 which is not the case with F-35.\u201d\n\nWork on the F-35, a \u201cfifth-generation\u201d fighter, first began in the 1980s and has since morphed into the most expensive weapons programme in history, with an estimated lifetime costs of $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) in the US through to 2088, according to the Pentagon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe UK first joined in 1995, contributing some money to development costs and in the process ensuring that hundreds of British companies became suppliers.\n\nThere are three variants of the jet (A, B and C), all of which use advanced technology to identify threats and link up with other platforms digitally \u2013 including, in future, unmanned drones.\n\nThe MoD opted for the short take-off and vertical landing-capable F-35B, due to a lack of arresting wires \u2013 which catch jets as they land \u2013 on the Royal Navy\u2019s Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.\n\nHowever, this capability also makes the F-35B the most expensive version of the plane and gives it a more limited maximum range and payload than others.\n\nAccording to the Government, each one costs about \u00a390m. However, defence analyst Tusa says this does not include the engine or other costs, with the real total pitching closer to \u00a3150m per plane.\n\nIn 2015, the MoD suggested it would seek to buy 138 F-35B jets over the programme\u2019s lifespan. But it has been reluctant to recommit to that number ever since and has only placed a firm order for 48 planes for delivery by 2025, with 34 received so far.\n\nThe previous Conservative government confirmed this year that it was in negotiations to buy another 27 for delivery by 2033, which Tusa expects to cost around \u00a35bn. Those negotiations remain ongoing.\n\nA spokesman for the MoD said: \u201cWhether operating from land or onboard our aircraft carriers as a central component of the UK\u2019s Carrier strike capability, the F-35B delivers a cutting-edge capability for the UK.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to the F-35 programme, and the UK builds approximately 15pc of each aircraft, securing highly skilled jobs and significant economic growth within the UK.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman added that the Government \u201cdidn\u2019t recognise\u201d the \u00a35bn estimated cost for buying further jets.\n\nAdvocates, including military chiefs in the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, have argued that acquiring more F-35Bs is essential to bringing Britain\u2019s aircraft carriers up to full strength, with the ability of the jets to operate from land and sea providing added flexibility.\n\nBut the programme has been beset by delays over the years, with the UK bringing them into service four years late in 2018 \u2013 and even then not at full capability.\n\nMPs have also criticised the MoD for failing to set out exactly how many of the jets are set aside for use with the aircraft carriers, versus other uses, raising the risk of double-counting in force estimates.\n\nIn the US, the F-35 has also become something of a poster-boy for overwrought, expensive defence fiascos in some quarters.\n\nMeanwhile, Lockheed was forced to halt deliveries globally last July, and only resumed them this month, after the US Air Force refused to accept more jets until hardware issues were fixed. The Pentagon's control of the F-35 programme has become a source of concern - AS1 Amber Mayall RAF\n\nThe F-35 has come under fire for being costly to operate as well. Sir Ben Wallace, a former defence secretary, previously raised concerns about this, with MPs on the defence select committee last year describing them as \u201cunacceptably high\u201d.\n\nThey also criticised the slow growth of the F-35B fleet and suggested exploring the possibility of bulking up Britain\u2019s air force with unmanned drones instead.\n\n\u201cAt present there are too many unresolved questions about the development and operational deployment of the [F-35] fleet,\u201d the MPs said.\n\n\u201cThe MoD must be transparent and realistic about the eventual size of the F-35 fleet ... and should also make clear whether it is attributed to the Royal Navy or the RAF.\u201d\n\nAnother criticism levelled at the F-35 is also the UK\u2019s lack of sovereignty over the platform and its technologies, which are effectively under the control of the Pentagon.\n\nThis is one argument industry supporters of the Tempest programme deployed at Farnborough International Airshow this week, after doubts about that scheme\u2019s future were stoked by noncommittal statements by Sir Keir and other ministers.\n\nAccording to BAE Systems, Tempest will support 16,000 jobs in Britain and add \u00a337bn to the economy, excluding potential exports.\n\nYet defenders of the F-35 say it is a highly capable aircraft that is proving doubters wrong, with orders flooding in from Nato countries such as Germany, Canada, Finland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Greece in recent years.\n\nDeployments of F-35s in Syria against Islamic State and on Eastern Europe\u2019s frontier with Russia were particularly effective.\n\nRetired general Jeffrey Harrigian, the former commander of the US Air Force in Europe who is now a vice-president at Lockheed Martin, said the stealth capabilities of the jets meant those deployed to the Middle East war zone could operate with impressive freedom.\n\n\u201cWe found ourselves in very good positions relative to the Russian airplanes that were flying around, such that if something would have come up, we were fully prepared to take care of business \u2013 and the Russians knew that,\u201d he told reporters at the Farnborough airshow on Tuesday.\n\nIn the buildup to the Ukraine war, the US and Nato allies including the UK and the Netherlands also stationed F-35s in the Baltics to deter Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cWe knew the Russians would know where they were. And we also knew they didn\u2019t want to have any part of dealing with F-35s,\u201d Harrigian said.\n\nProfessor Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow for air power and technology at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), says the F-35 is essential to maintaining British airpower through to the 2030s, when Tempest is expected to come online.\n\n\u201cI think the UK should definitely proceed with the follow-on order of 27, to take the fleet to 74,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s more or less the functional minimum for the fleet to meet its obligations.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, I don\u2019t see much fiscal room for additional orders in the foreseeable future and, in any case, if there was additional money ... I would put it into weapons and maintenance and spares, to improve the combat capability and availability.\u201d\n\nHe is sceptical about grumbling on sovereignty with the F-35, pointing out that Britain already works with international partners on the existing Eurofighter Typhoon programme and will do so for Tempest as well.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly some trade-offs, but I think the sovereignty issue is significantly overblown,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe UK doesn\u2019t have sovereign control over the Typhoon or Tempest either, because it\u2019s beholden to the requirements and needs of the other partner [countries] \u2013 so the idea there\u2019s some sort of mystical sovereignty involved in any of these is fairly obviously not true.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the F-35\u2019s contribution to the British economy should not be underestimated, either.\n\nMore than 800 domestic companies work on the programme including ejector seat maker Martin Baker and Rolls-Royce, which makes the F-35B\u2019s vertical lift system.\n\nAccording to Lockheed, it has generated an estimated \u00a345bn of exports so far for the UK and is expected to support up to 20,000 British jobs over its lifetime.\n\nJames Cartlidge, a former Conservative defence procurement minister and now shadow defence secretary, believes seeing Tempest and the F-35 as opposing choices is a false dichotomy.\n\nHe says Labour should announce a timeline for reaching 2.5pc of GDP in defence spending by 2030, as the Conservatives did during the election, and shut down doubts about funding.\n\n\u201cIf Labour commits to that, you can order the F-35s and invest in [Tempest], which gives you the best of both worlds,\u201d he says.\n\nLockheed Martin adds that the F-35 is \u201ccurrently the fighter of choice for Nato and its allies and will be a cornerstone of the defence and security in Europe for decades to come\u201d.\n\nBut defence analyst Tusa believes Labour\u2019s review may yet throw out some bombshell recommendations.\n\nLord Robertson, the former Nato secretary general who is leading the exercise and who as Labour defence secretary oversaw a similar one in the 1990s, is \u201cno patsy\u201d, Tusa says.\n\nFor example, depending on whether he recommends focusing more exclusively on Europe and Britain\u2019s Nato commitments \u2013 ditching Boris Johnson\u2019s Indo-Pacific \u201ctilt\u201d \u2013 even HMS Prince of Wales and her sister carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, could be at risk.\n\nThat may ultimately mean fewer F-35s as well.\n\n\u201cThere have to be cuts somewhere because the current system is unaffordable,\u201d Tusa adds.\n\n\u201cAnd there will be squeals of outrage. But what can you say? There\u2019s no choice.\u201d",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nTexas Capital Bancshares\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Citi downgraded Texas Capital Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:TCBI) to Sell with a $60 price target.\n\n*TLDR: *2025 goals appear unachievable in a lower rate environment. *Citi remains cautious.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Citi maintains a cautious stance on TCBI, despite the soft share price reaction following the company\u2019s second-quarter results. The analysts continue to see downside from current levels, as the earnings outlook over the next 12 months appears rather uninspiring.\n\nWhile the core franchise has undergone significant changes since 2020, Citi believes that the 2025 Goal metrics are unachievable in a lower interest rate environment. Despite the already below peer Price-to-Tangible Book Value valuation, Citi continues to foresee further downside.\n\nSell at Citi means \u201cBuy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. \u201c\n\nHow did the stock react? Texas Capital Banc shares opened the regular session at $64.69 and closed at $66.70, a gain of 1.06% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nSkechers\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley upgraded Skechers (NYSE:SKX) to Overweight with a $80 price target.\n\n*TLDR: *Set-up for positive consensus revisions. *Management improves Skecher financial metrics.* Morgan Stanley sees possible +26% share price appreciation inside 12-18 months.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Morgan Stanley\u2019s updated price target reflects a modestly improved operating model and updated DCF assumptions. For FY24, the bank\u2019s estimates remain largely unchanged, continuing to see upside to Street EPS forecasts across sales, GM, and SG&A. As a result, the bank analysts are modeling $4.20 EPS versus the consensus of $4.10.\n\nLooking at the future, the bank is now more constructive on SKX\u2019s mid-term margin profile, driven primarily by an improved GM outlook. Early signs indicate that GM is holding at structurally higher levels of 53%+. This view is taken because survey results and channel checks suggest that consumers continue to view SKX as a value-oriented brand, brand momentum remains strong despite price-taking activities over the last few years, and innovation capabilities are being increasingly recognized. These factors together increase Morgan Stanley\u2019s comfort with SKX\u2019s ability to maintain or expand GM from here.\n\nAs such, Morgan Stanley now models a 12% average operating margin for '24-'28e versus 11% prior, driven primarily by a more optimistic GM outlook. The mid-term sales growth expectations remain largely unchanged at ~10% average '24-'28e growth. Combined with updated WACC inputs (4.3% risk-free rate & 4.1% equity risk premium versus 4.1% & 4.6% prior, respectively) that result in a 9.4% WACC (versus 10% prior), this yields an $80 DCF-derived price target compared to $60 prior, representing a 26% upside from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverweight at Morgan Stanley means \u201cThe stock's total return is expected to exceed the total return of the relevant country MSCI Index or the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12-18 months .\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Skechers opened the regular session at $66.24 and closed at $65.10, a gain of 1.39% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, TD Cowen upgraded Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to Buy with a $560 price target.\n\n*TLDR: *Strong Q2 for Lockheed Martin (LMT): Driven by F-35 delivery restart and leading FMS/munitions market position, projecting ~5% sales gains, 10-20bps margin lift, and rising cash flow for 2024-2026. *Despite positives, stock lags with a 20% net buy rating\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? TD Cowen analysts highlight a strong Q2 performance for Lockheed Martin, driven by the restart of F-35 deliveries and its leading position in the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and munitions market. This has provided LMT with enhanced visibility of approximately 5% sales gains, a 10-20 basis points annual margin lift, and rising cash flow projections for 2024-2026. Despite these positive indicators, the stock has lagged year-to-date, with a peer-low 20% net buy rating.\n\nThe analysts note that with the resumption of F-35 deliveries, LMT has reached an agreement with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a schedule for completing TR3 updates and is negotiating the timing for final delivery payments of around $7 million per aircraft, totaling approximately $1 billion. Given that LMT has delivered only 1,300 of the planned 3,400+ F-35 fighters, it is unlikely that the DoD will cut production even if software issues remain unresolved. Additionally, LMT\u2019s ownership of the intellectual property gives it leverage in these negotiations. The analysts foresee low to mid-single-digit F-35 sales growth from 2025-2027 as sustainment grows with the fleet and delivery payments catch up. Furthermore, the F-16 program, with a backlog of 125 planes, is ramping up production from two to four planes per month by the second half of 2026. Both programs are expected to see increasing profitability, contributing to 28% of LMT\u2019s sales.\n\nBuy at TD Cowen means \u201cThe stock is expected to achieve a total return of +15% or more over the next 12 months.\u201c\n\nHow did the stock react? Lockheed Martin opened the regular session at $504.21 and closed at $515.20, a gain of 2.77% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nOmega Healthcare Investors\n\nWhat happened? On Mizuho, downgraded Omega Healthcare Investors Inc (NYSE:OHI) to Neutral with a $35 price target\n\n*TLDR: *Valuation is key driver of downgrade following outperformance against peers. *Mizuho sees nothing wrong with the OHI as a business.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Mizuho has downgraded Omega Healthcare Investors to Neutral from Outperform, stating that the current valuation largely reflects the three pillars of its previous top pick stance. The brokerage clarified that this downgrade is not a call into earnings.\n\nPreviously, Mizuho had highlighted several reasons for favoring skilled nursing facilities and particularly Omega: higher than anticipated cash collections from tenants in restructuring, an increase in external growth through acquisitions, and a more benign regulatory environment.\n\nWhile Mizuho continues to see a high single-digit cash flow trajectory into FY 2025, the stock has outperformed REITs by 18bps year-to-date and is trading close to 13x adjusted funds from operations, which is near historical highs. As a result, the brokerage believes the positives are largely reflected in the current valuation\n\nNeutral at Mizuho means \u201cThe stock\u2019s total return is expected to perform in line with the unweighted, expected total return of the analyst\u2019s industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Omega Healthcare Investors opened the regular session at $35.97 and closed at $35.73, a decline of 1.81% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Deutsche Bank upgraded Lockheed Martin to Buy with a $600 price target. This is the second upgrade of the week for the defense company.\n\n*TLDR:* Strong Q2 report showing gains on repricing of backlog should continue momentum through 2025 and 2026 as data surprises consensus.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? This upgrade is driven by strong second-quarter results, which, after further analysis, indicate a promising beat/raise opportunity in the second half of 2024. The bank believes this momentum could extend into 2025 and 2026, with potential upside to 2026 EBIT approaching the high single-digit range. If the outlook on revisions for LMT is positive relative to Deutsche Bank\u2019s and the Street\u2019s printed numbers, the stock could rerate to reflect this opportunity, supporting a 5.0% target free cash flow yield on 2026, driving the updated target price of $600, representing a 15% upside potential.\n\nFor the second half of 2024, Deutsche Bank anticipates improved operational performance and a significant spread between trailing three-year backlog growth (+17%) and trailing three-year revenue growth (+7%), suggesting additional revenue upside. Recently improved cost and EAC trends, along with the benefit of an increasingly repriced backlog, point to continued positive margin surprises. This could drive approximately 4% EBIT upside to second-half 2024 Street EBIT forecasts. Looking ahead to 2025 and 2026, Deutsche Bank expects revenue growth to approach 6%+ versus the Street\u2019s 3.9%/3.6%, with additional margin normalization across the business, making it feasible to achieve high single-digit EBIT upside to Street estimates for 2026. While Deutsche Bank has raised its estimates conservatively, it is modeling EBIT growth at a 7% CAGR over the next two years, viewing LMT as a high-quality way to participate in a global defense upcycle.\n\nBuy at Deutsche Bank means \u201cBased on a current 12-month view of TSR, we recommend that investors buy the stock.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Lockheed Martin opened the regular session at $522.89 and closed at $524.80, a gain of 0.63% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Upgrades for Skechers and Lockheed Martin\n\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n\nMitsubishi Motors to join Honda-Nissan alliance, Nikkei reports\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Nasdaq and S&P 500 had their worst days since 2022, driven by disappointing earnings from mega-cap names. Recession indicators are flashing yellow, with the \u201cSahm Rule\u201d unemployment metric edging dangerously close to signaling a downturn.\n\nYes, the inverted yield curve has been wrong so far this time around, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore other warning signs. Corporate bond spreads are whispering \u201ceconomic slowdown,\u201d and consumer debt delinquencies are ticking up. While I still believe there are big pockets of opportunity in this market, the seven stocks I\u2019m discussing today are not among them.\n\nThese companies\u2019 unsustainable financials make them toxic to your portfolio, regardless of where we are in the economic cycle. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoPro (GPRO) An image of the logo for GoPro Inc (GPRO).\n\nSource: GoPro\n\nGoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) is a dying company. The age of handheld cameras and vlogs is over. Many people still use them, but I don\u2019t see growth here anymore. Smartphones now have powerful cameras that are much more convenient for modern content creators. Vlogging has also declined in relevance, and serious vloggers use higher-end equipment. GoPro\u2019s default aspect ratio makes the content feel dated. You can change that, but a default 4:3 ratio makes GoPro videos feel ancient in 2024.\n\nI believe GoPro\u2019s decline will continue as smartphone cameras improve their durability. I expect very little revenue growth in the coming years, and annual sales will likely dip below $900 million within three to four years. At this rate, debt should also surpass cash by a big margin. Stocks to Sell: GPRO cash\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRecent financials paint a bleak picture. GoPro\u2019s revenue fell 8% to $1 billion in 2023, and sales dropped another 11% year-over-year to $155 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe company is banking on new products and subscription growth to turn things around. However, I\u2019m skeptical that these will offset the decline in the action camera market. I\u2019d avoid the stock.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT)operates the largest electric vehicle charging network in the U.S., but the company has been struggling lately. Shares have plummeted over 70% in the past year as revenue growth has stalled and losses continue to mount.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, ChargePoint reported an 18% year-over-year decline in revenue to $107 million. The company also posted a staggering $71.8 million net loss.\n\nWhile some analysts still see big upside potential in the stock, I remain deeply skeptical. ChargePoint is burning through cash at an alarming rate and faces intensifying competition in the EV charging space. The company\u2019s plan to focus more on its software subscription business seems like too little, too late.\n\nStory continues CHPT financial estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThose estimates don\u2019t scream a \u201cBuy.\u201d\n\nChargePoint is destined for bankruptcy in the coming years, barring a miraculous turnaround. The company has simply overextended itself and doesn\u2019t have the financial wherewithal to survive the slower-than-expected rollout of EVs. Most EV startups are hemorrhaging money and won\u2019t be viable unless we enter some fantasy world of negative interest rates.\n\nNikola (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nNikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) has entered the typical EV startup death cycle of reverse splits and dilution. Last month, the company executed a 1-for-30 reverse stock split to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq. Despite this, the stock languishes around $9, a far cry from its split-adjusted highs of nearly $2,000.\n\nFinancially, the picture looks bleak. Nikola\u2019s net loss in Q1 2024 stood at\u00a0\u00a0$147.7 million, and its annual loss ballooned to $966 million in 2023. Cash is dwindling, with just $345 million on hand at the end of Q1, hardly enough to sustain the company\u2019s ambitious plans. Expect more dilutive offerings on the horizon as Nikola scrambles to stay afloat.\n\nI believe investors should steer clear of most, if not all, EV startups right now, Nikola included. These companies are unlikely to turn a profit anytime soon, and with the political winds shifting, the generous subsidies they rely on may evaporate under a potential Trump administration. The risks far outweigh any potential rewards. Nikola looks to me like Fisker 2.0, which management is dragging out.\n\nTerran Orbital (LLAP) sell button on the background of exchange charts of currencies, crypto exchange, growth stocks to sell\n\nSource: silicaetran / Shutterstock.com\n\nTerran Orbital (NYSE:LLAP) is a struggling satellite manufacturer that, unless drastic changes occur, is on the brink of bankruptcy. The company has signed a massive but precarious $2.4 billion deal with startup Rivada Space Networks.\n\nRivada has grand ambitions but is far from an established player in the space industry. Rich Smith from The Motley Foolsaid: \u201c\u2026 Rivada is an alleged space company that no one seems to have heard of, and that according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, may have annual revenues of less than $5 million\u2026 but is somehow promising to pay Terran Orbital $2.4 billion to build it 300 satellites.\u201d\n\nThere are serious doubts about whether Rivada can secure the funding to implement its constellation plans, which would leave Terran holding the bag.\n\nMeanwhile, Terran is hemorrhaging cash as it scrambles to fulfill Rivada\u2019s orders. The company reported a net loss of $53.2 million in Q1 on revenue of $27.2 million. Terran simply doesn\u2019t have the financial runway to keep this up for long.\n\nA recent $500 million acquisition offer from Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) could have thrown Terran a lifeline, but Lockheed abruptly withdrew the bid in May, likely spooked by the Rivada situation. While Lockheed threw Terran an 18-satellite contract, that won\u2019t help much.\r\n\r\nIts Altman-Z score is below the 1.8 \u201chigh risk for bankruptcy\u201d zone.

Double exposure of digital coins price drop and technical chart. Both are in red color theme to indicate the bearish stage. Cryptos to sell. cryptocurrencies to sell\n\nSource: kkssr / Shutterstock.com\n\nLanzaTech (NASDAQ:LNZA) is a carbon recycling company that transforms waste carbon into sustainable raw materials. The company recently reported disappointing Q1 2024 earnings, missing the top and bottom lines.\n\nI want to believe in LanzaTech\u2019s vision of a circular carbon economy, but I have severe doubts about its path to profitability. The company is hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate, with a cash burn of $106 million over the past year. Analysts project LanzaTech won\u2019t break even until 2026 at the earliest. Assuming everything goes perfectly according to plan is a big if.\n\nMany of LanzaTech\u2019s projects are located in countries with lax environmental regulations. Will these international partners follow through on their sustainability commitments? Color me skeptical. Even in the U.S. and Europe, I struggle to see how LanzaTech will turn a profit anytime soon. Analysts expect strong revenue growth in the near term but predict a sharp 26% decline in 2026. Ouch. Oh, and that loss profile isn\u2019t expected to improve much. LNZA financial estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe elephant in the room is the 2024 U.S. presidential election. A change in administration could spell disaster for green tech firms.\n\nGameSquare Holdings (GAME) image of someone playing video games to represent gaming stocks\n\nSource: korobskyph / Shutterstock.com\n\nI didn\u2019t have much of an opinion about GameSquareHoldings (NASDAQ:GAME) one way or the other \u2014 until their recent acquisition of FaZe Clan. I\u2019m questioning whether management understands how to navigate the gaming space. FaZe Clan may have been a big name a decade ago, but their relevance and influence have waned significantly in recent years. GameSquare is trying to buy buzz instead of building something sustainable.\n\nThe reality is that the gaming space outside of gambling is notoriously unprofitable, with only a few standout successes. And I just don\u2019t see GameSquare being one of those rare winners. They seem to be chasing the \u201cinfluencer\u201d trend and esports hype but without a clear path to monetization. Selling off part of their stake in FaZe Media shortly after acquiring it is not exactly a vote of confidence, either.\n\nQ1 2024 revenue came in at $23.5 million, down slightly from $24.1 million a year ago. Gross margins also slipped to 15.7% from 16.5%. The company is touting $18 million in expected cost synergies from the FaZe deal, but I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. The bottom line is that I think GameSquare bit off more than they can chew with FaZe Clan. They\u2019d be wise to cut their losses, sell the rest of that stake and refocus on something more relevant in 2024.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme. Illustrative photo for news about Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat substitutes. BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nI love the idea behind Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) \u2014 providing tasty meat alternatives that are better for animals and the environment. If plant-based meats can eventually match the taste and price of real meat, I think they have immense potential to transform the food industry for the better.\n\nHowever, the unfortunate reality is that Beyond Meat looks nowhere close to achieving profitability anytime soon. The company reported a net loss of $54.4 million in Q1 2024 as revenue declined 18% year-over-year. Gross margins remain abysmal at under 5%. Analysts have turned extremely bearish, with firms like Goldman Sachs and TD Cowen reiterating their sell ratings and slashing price targets. Recent EBIT misses are also very concerning, so take any estimates here with a spoonful of salt. BYND EBIT misses\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nBeyond Meat is even struggling in its backyard of California, a state you\u2019d think would be very receptive to plant-based meats. But if they can\u2019t make the economics work there, I\u2019m skeptical the business model is viable on a broader scale nationally, at least not yet.\n\nI believe plant-based meats will gain traction in the long term as companies improve taste and drive down costs. But we appear to be many years away from that inflection point. For now, I love the company but not the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Lockheed Martin Stock Now?",
        "content": "In light of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, one might assume that aerospace/defense giant Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) would be a darling on Wall Street. Yet, Lockheed Martin stock gained little ground in 2024's first half.\n\nThen July came around, and suddenly Lockheed Martin stock's trajectory went from horizontal to vertical. This raises the question of \"Is it too late to invest?\" and, just as importantly, \"What sent the stock soaring?\" As it turns out, Lockheed Martin's Street-beating results and optimistic outlook suggest that a sustained share-price rally may be in store.\n\nThe jets that didn't fly (yet)\n\nIt's not difficult to figure out why Lockheed Martin stock flew in July. The primary catalyst was the company's second-quarter report, which certainly had some positive highlights.\n\nLockheed Martin's deliveries of a well-known aircraft wasn't one of those highlights, though. The company delivered no F-35 combat jets in Q2 and, due to required fixes of technical issues, Lockheed Martin has had $10 billion worth of those jets sitting outside of a factory, yet to be delivered.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean the F-35s won't be delivered, and Lockheed Martin delivered other aircraft types during the second quarter. Rather than focus on recently delivered F-35s (or the lack thereof), forward-looking investors might take note of Lockheed Martin's Q2 order backlog of $158.34 billion, which isn't very different from the company's $160.57 billion backlog from the year-earlier quarter.\n\nIn any case, Lockheed Martin already started delivering updated TR-3 F-35 combat jets to the U.S. military and anticipates delivering 75 to 110 F-35 jets during 2024's second half. So, upcoming quarterly reports shouldn't have a goose egg in the column for F-35 deliveries.\n\nA sunny outlook for dark times\n\nDespite the lack of F-35 deliveries, international conflicts ensured that Lockheed Martin would still fare well in the second quarter of 2024. Large-scale Pentagon contracts for missiles to be sent to Ukraine helped Lockheed Martin grow its revenue by 9% year over year to $18.1 billion, beating Wall Street's call for $17 billion. Turning to the bottom-line results, Lockheed Martin earned $6.84 per share, thereby beating the analysts' consensus estimate of $6.46 per share and showing improvement over the $6.73 per share earned in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nPerhaps most encouraging, Lockheed Martin raised its full-year 2024 financial guidance. Specifically, the company lifted its net sales outlook range from $68.5 billion to $70 billion previously to $70.5 billion to $71.5 billion currently. Additionally, Lockheed Martin hiked its 2024 earnings per share (EPS) guidance range from $25.65 to $26.35 previously to a currently expected range of $26.10 to $26.60.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that, Lockheed Martin CEO Jim Taiclet maintained an optimistic tone and made sure to remind investors of Lockheed's \"backlog of nearly $160 billion, greater than two times annual revenue.\" The subtext, no doubt, is that the fiscal figures should only get better for Lockheed Martin.\n\nWhether Lockheed Martin actually meets its hiked full-year guidance remains to be seen. The winds of war can shift at any given moment, and so can Lockheed Martin's outlook for the back half of 2024.\n\nStill, until proven otherwise, it looks like Lockheed Martin's future prospects are bright, or at least brighter than they were before. Therefore, it's not too late to pick up a few shares of Lockheed Martin stock with hopes of peace but expectations that nations won't resolve their disagreements anytime soon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin upgraded, L3Harris downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Lockheed Martin(LMT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $600, up from $540. The company's \"strong\" Q2 results point to an \"attractive beat/raise opportunity\" in the second half of 2024, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Evercore ISI upgraded CBRE Group(CBRE) to Outperform from In Line with a price target of $123, up from $100. The company increased its 2024 earnings guidance by 8% to reflect the Q2 beat and an improved outlook across a number of business lines, including a less bad sales environment, improved profitability in the REI segment and better cost controls across the organization, the analyst says. BofA upgraded Duolingo(DUOL) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $245 following a 31% pullback in the share price since Q1 earnings in early May. Duolingo boasts the highest growth among the analyst's internet coverage and the firm sees \"ample opportunity\" for user, revenue and EBITDA upside, BofA says. Stifel upgraded FTAI Aviation (FTAI) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $132, up from $69. If the narrow-body engine market is going to be tight through 2027 and beyond, \"this stock is worth buying, even if it is expensive today,\" the analyst tells investors in a research note. Evercore ISI upgraded Invitation Homes(INVH) to Outperform from In Line with an unchanged price target of $37. Despite the minimal changes to estimates and the guidance outlook, Invitation's stock fell nearly 8% on Thursday as investors seemed concerned by the modest downward revision in top line growth, though the firm believes the pullback creates a good entry point.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank downgraded L3Harris Technologies(LHX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $257, up from $245. The analyst cites valuation for the downgrade with the shares up 16% year-to-date. Morgan Stanley downgraded WW (WW) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $1.25, down from $6.50. The firm's data implies \"broad top of funnel issues\" which may pressure the company's subscriber growth and profitability. Deutsche Bank downgraded Southwest Airlines(LUV) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $29, down from $32. Despite reporting record revenues driven by record passenger volumes, Southwest continues to experience margin pressure as its revenue generation continues to lag its elevated cost structure, the analyst tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan downgraded DexCom(DXCM) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $75, down from $145. The analyst says \"there's no getting away from the fact\" that the Q2 update was a \"sharp turn in the wrong direction for the Dexcom story.\" Baird downgraded DexCom to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $80, down from $161. TD Cowen downgraded GlycoMimetics(GLYC) to Hold from Buy without a price target. The analyst cites the \"disappointing\" Phase III miss for uproleselan in acute myeloid leukemia and the \"now much longer timeline\" to potential success in the refractory subgroup for the downgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nStifel initiated coverage of Riot Platforms(RIOT) with a Speculative Buy rating and $18 price target. Riot has faced operational headwinds in the past, but the company is approaching a turning point with the phased build-out of Corsicana, fleet upgrades at Rockdale and the acquisition of Block Mining, says the analyst. Redburn Atlantic initiated coverage of DoorDash(DASH) with a Buy rating and $170 price target, which offers 66% potential upside to the current price. With the \"greatest freedom to invest and best track record for driving share gains,\" DoorDash is well positioned to deliver industry-leading, above-consensus volume growth with multiple levers to achieve above-consensus adjusted EBITDA, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of CervoMed(CRVO) with an Overweight rating and $35 price target. The firm says neflamapimod is a selective oral small molecule that inhibits p38N1, a key drug target in central nervous system diseases, and is currently being evaluated for the treatment of pure dementia with Lewy bodies, which is the second most common dementia behind Alzheimer's disease with no currently approved treatments in the U.S. or EU. Lake Street initiated coverage of Dave(DAVE) with a Buy rating and $53 price target. Dave's short-term ExtraCash advances and mobile banking platform are growing share in the underserved and underbanked segments of the market, notes the analyst, who thinks shares have been \"lumped in with the class of 2021-2022 SPACs and have largely been overlooked by institutional investors.\" Piper Sandler initiated coverage of AG Mortgage(MITT) with an Overweight rating and $9 price target. AG is well positioned to see earnings growth throughout 2024 and 2025 as net interest income trends higher while scale and operating efficiencies show through from the WMC acquisition, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Greece signs deal to buy 20 US-made F-35 jets in major military overhaul",
        "content": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece formally approved an offer to buy 20 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters from the United States as part of a major defense overhaul, government officials said Thursday.\n\nDefense Minister Nikos Dendias said while visiting a military air base near Athens that the purchase would create \u201ca powerful deterrent presence in our region.\u201d A letter of acceptance for the deal has been signed and sent to the U.S., he said.\n\nDelivery of the fifth-generation jet made by Lockheed Martin is expected to start in 2028, while Greece maintains the option to purchase 20 additional F-35 jets as part of an $8.6 billion deal.\n\nThe purchase of the first 20 jets along with additional support will cost some $3.5 billion, Greek officials said.\n\nGreece is overhauling its military in a decade-long program following a protracted financial crisis and continued tension with neighbor and NATO ally Turkey, mostly over a volatile sea boundary dispute.\n\nTurkey was dropped from the F-35 program five years ago over its decision to buy Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a move seen in the United States as compromising NATO security.\n\nIn Athens, government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis described the current military modernization campaign as the most significant in \u201cmany decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to implement this major program, equipping our country and armoring its defenses,\u201d Marinakis said.\n\nAthens has been seeking an advantage in the air since Turkey\u2019s exclusion from F-35 purchases and has also acquired advanced French-made Rafale fighter jets. Deliveries to the Greek air force began in 2021, starting with jets previously used by France\u2019s military that will be supplemented by new aircraft built by French defense contractor Dassault Aviation.\n\nBridget Lauderdale, Lockheed Martin\u2019s vice president and general manager of the F-35 program, described her company's aircraft as being ideal to \u201cstrengthen Greece\u2019s sovereignty and operational capability with allies.\u201d\n\n\"It is our honor to continue (our) relationship as Greece becomes the 19th nation to join the F-35 program,\u201d she said,\n\nThe U.S. State Department in January approved the sale that could eventually total 40 F-35 aircraft, along with 42 engines as well as services and equipment including secure communications devices, electronic warfare systems, training, logistics, and maintenance support.\n\nCurrent members of the F-35 program, either as participants or through military sales, are: the United States, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway, Israel, Japan, Korea, Belgium, Poland, Singapore, Finland, Switzerland, Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) Just Beat Earnings: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) defied analyst predictions to release its second-quarter results, which were ahead of market expectations. The company beat expectations with revenues of US$18b arriving 6.5% ahead of forecasts. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) were US$6.85, 6.0% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, Lockheed Martin's 20 analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be US$70.9b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to shrink 6.6% to US$26.38 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$69.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$26.26 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$515, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Lockheed Martin at US$577 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$387. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Lockheed Martin shareholders.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 0.4% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 3.0% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 2.6% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Lockheed Martin is expected to lag the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Lockheed Martin's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$515, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Lockheed Martin going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nYou should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted  1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should be aware of.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Buy as the Geopolitical Temperature Rises",
        "content": "Like it or not, defense stocks have always been an important sector of the market. Some might make the argument that it\u2019s the most important segment. Essentially, while the subject is controversial, free societies must establish mechanisms to keep honest people honest. The threat of extreme violence is what has kept the peace. But that paradigm may soon change.\n\nI really laid out the case for defense stocks in a TipRanks article I wrote recently. Essentially, a strong case can be made that Donald Trump and the Republicans have an easy road to the White House (and perhaps other seats of power). And because the so-called MAGA conservatives favor an isolationist foreign policy, U.S. partners are sweating bullets.\n\nWhere the matter gets especially murky is that Trump constantly talks about peace. The word aligns with basic Christian theology, likely in a bid among Republicans to court evangelicals. However, reasonable people understand that sanctification cannot precede justification.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIsolationism of the MAGA variety reverses this established narrative \u2013 and that\u2019s what has global partners freaked out. The only \u201cgood\u201d that can come out of it is potential profitability of these defense stocks to buy.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest defense stocks in the world, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is really in the spotlight right now. Just recently, the company disclosed blowout earnings for the second quarter. While analysts presently rate LMT stock as a consensus hold, that might change over the next several days. Further, if Donald Trump is elected to a second term, demand for Lockheed\u2019s defense solutions could skyrocket.\n\nWhat has international partners worried is Trump\u2019s broadcasting of isolationist sentiments. Not too long ago, he bemoaned that Taiwan doesn\u2019t do enough to support its own defense. At the same time, the former president accused the island nation of basically grabbing the entire share of the burgeoning semiconductor ecosystem. Now, reports are coming out that many Taiwanese favor boosting defense spending.\n\nIt\u2019s going to have to considering that China has its eyes on it. Further, if the U.S. goes through with a hands-off policy, then Taiwan may have to defend itself. After all, under this contrarian framework, a little bit of violence should be allowed to prevent excessive violence.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure what that means. However, it does seem cynically positive for LMT and other defense stocks.\n\nHuntington Ingalls (HII) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with an isolationist policy \u2013 assuming that Trump wins in November \u2013 the U.S. cannot afford to shirk its unofficial responsibilities. Sure, the populist movement (ala former Congressman Ron Paul) decries foreign intervention. Here\u2019s the problem: if the U.S. doesn\u2019t impose its hegemony on others, then other countries will eagerly fill the power gap. And that\u2019s what brings us to Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII).\n\nHuntington Ingalls is a defense contractor specializing in maritime solutions. Basically, if you want to invest in the U.S. Navy, you acquire shares of HII stock. That\u2019s about as close as you can get. Most importantly, all great powers project their strength through the high seas. In this case, China\u2019s naval ambitions present a huge threat to the U.S. and global democracies.\n\nAlmost certainly, this framework will lead to significant growth in Huntington sales over the next several years. Even with Trump\u2019s populist and isolationist message, presumably no American politician can survive a deliberate acquiescence to the Chinese. It\u2019s just not going to happen, especially because of our heated economic rivalry.\n\nSo, forget about the day-to-day financials. Instead, I\u2019d look to HII as one of the defense stocks to consider for the long term.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV), the catalyst for the business is a kinetic motivation. In contrast, Lockheed Martin and Huntington Ingalls represent more strategic investments; that is, their core products represent a show of power that may prevent/discourage war. Should conflicts go hot, these weapons systems would be ready to go. In AeroVironment\u2019s case, the core product essentially assumes a hot conflict.\n\nThat\u2019s because AereoVironment specializes in unmanned drones that loiter in the air, seeking out targets. When a human operator that is miles away from the shooting spots a target, the drone slams into it, causing damage or outright destruction. AeroVironment became sort of a household name thanks to its tremendous success in Ukraine.\n\nIn the years ahead, I anticipate company sales to soar \u2013 and that\u2019s especially the case under a second Trump administration. An isolationist policy essentially green lights dictators to see what they can get away with. And then said dictators can profit from their warmongering because the White House would push for \u201cpeace.\u201d\n\nThreatened democracies would be on notice: protect yourself because America is staying home. That\u2019s bad for stability but good for defense stocks like AVAV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The firm said that Spotify is the clear global audio platform leader, which it expects to translate into compounded user growth, rising engagement, and pricing power, and the company is continuing to show gross and operating margin momentum. RBC Capital upgraded Estee Lauder(EL) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a $131 price target. The firm believes the company's earnings and investor sentiment have troughed and that the stock's risk-to-reward profile skews favorable. TD Cowen upgraded Lockheed Martin(LMT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $560, up from $480. The company's strong Q2 and F-35 delivery restart give Lockheed enhanced visibility of 5% sales gains, 10-20 points of margin lift, and rising cash flow through 2026, the firm tells investors in a research note Leerink upgraded Ionis Pharmaceuticals(IONS) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $62, up from $53, following the Angelman syndrome update. As the company transitions to its wholly owned assets, investor focus has shifted toward olezarsen and donidalorsen as a series of assets reach commercialization, the firm says. Deutsche Bank upgraded Invitation Homes(INVH) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $41, up from $35. The firm believes single family for rent companies could generate better earnings growth in 2024 and 2025, especially given that there is no supply overhang which is an issue on the multifamily side.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nNew Street downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Neutral from Buy with a $225 price target following the Q2 report. The company's deliveries recovered \"at a cost,\" increasing by 15% quarter-over-quarter, but with gross margins, excluding credits and leasing, down 1.7 points. Cantor Fitzgerald also downgraded Tesla to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $245, up from $230. Morgan Stanley downgraded General Motors(GM) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $47, up from $46. The firm cites industry price pressure, EV and China risks as well as what it sees as a balanced risk/reward for its downgrade. Gordon Haskett downgraded Five Below(FIVE) to Hold from Accumulate with an $85 price target after the company last week \"surprisingly pre-announced disappointing\" Q2 to-date sales in conjunction with the resignation of long-time CEO Joel Anderson. Piper Sandler downgraded Ulta Beauty(ULTA) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $404, down from $494. Despite efforts to improve efficiencies in the supply chain, it is not enough to offset the several sources of margin dilution, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays downgraded BWX Technologies(BWXT) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $90, up from $75. The firm sees risk to BWX's medium term mid-to-high-single digit EBITDA target, even with accelerating growth from medical/power.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nSeaport Research initiated coverage of Imax (IMAX) with a Buy rating and $23 price target. The firm sees \"a distinct near-term opportunity\" for Imax shares to start to recognize that the film industry's theatrical release schedule will start heading toward normalcy and calls the stock \"a small-cap way to leverage this trend.\" TD Cowen initiated coverage of JFrog (FROG) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. The firm says the company's cloud story is attractive and argues that its seasonally weaker Q1 offers a buying opportunity. Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Biohaven (BHVN) with an Overweight rating and $58 price target. The firm sees several drivers of value creation from the company's \"broad\" pipeline across multiple disease areas, which it believes is unique among smid-cap biotech. Leerink initiated coverage of Tectonic Therapeutic(TECX) with an Outperform rating and $49 price target. The firm says the major stock value drivers over the next two years are TX45 developments, TX45 competitive news flow, and GPCR3 antagonist candidate progress. Baird initiated coverage of Aaon (AAON) with a Neutral rating and $100 price target. The firm is bullish on the company's long-term fundamentals and market positioning, but says the recent rally and 2025 estimates that embed meaningful growth and margin reacceleration balance the stock's near-term risk/reward.\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "Why Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Could Win Under a Trump Administration",
        "content": "On the surface level, a second round of the Trump administration might not appear to bode well for aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT). The former president and current Republican candidate for the White House made some comments that implied the U.S. would enter an isolationist stance (focusing on U.S. interests and reducing international involvement). However, this could actually lead America\u2019s worried allies to increase their military budgets to compensate. Otherwise, the consequences could be devastating. Thus, I am ultimately bullish on LMT stock.\n\nShifting Geopolitical Grounds May Boost LMT Stock Financials\n\nRecently, Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for its defense. Some of the friction appears to be centered on the island\u2019s economic success, particularly in the semiconductor realm. Indeed, the former real estate mogul and reality television star declared that it took \u201cabout 100%\u201d of the U.S. semiconductor business.\n\nTo be fair, Trump has made some outlandish remarks in the past. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to know when the jesting ends and the truth begins. However, what is known is that the former president prefers a generally isolationist policy, even if it means sacrificing accountability. For example, Trump has made friendly overtures to North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. He\u2019s done the same for Russia and China.\n\nThis sets the stage for an unusual backdrop for LMT stock. Right now, shares trade hands at 1.79x trailing-year sales. Currently, the price-to-sales ratio of the aerospace and defense industry comes in at 1.8x. Therefore, Lockheed is slightly undervalued.\n\nAs for trailing earnings, the market prices LMT stock at 18.36x. This metric sits much lower than the industry average 29.13x. However, there\u2019s a caveat to this particular figure.\n\nBy the end of the current fiscal year, analysts believe that earnings per share may land at $26.26. That would come out to a decline of 5.71% from last year\u2019s print of $27.85. Further, investors may have to wait until the end of Fiscal 2025 for the consensus EPS to improve to $27.96. That\u2019s not exactly encouraging.\n\nThe top line presents a better-looking profile. Covering experts are hoping for revenue to hit $69.82 billion, up 3.3% from 2023\u2019s haul of $67.57 billion. By the following year, sales may improve to $72.4 billion, up 3.7% from projected 2024 revenue.\n\nAssuming that the share count of 237.94 million remains the same, LMT stock would be trading at 1.62x projected 2024 sales and 1.56x projected 2025 sales. Moreover, Lockheed just posted second-quarter earnings that significantly exceeded Wall Street estimates. So, it\u2019s possible that analysts need to rethink their projections in favor of the bulls.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, even without the blowout earnings, if Trump wins a second term and takes an isolationist stance, this framework will likely favor Lockheed Martin. In other words, Lockheed is winning in a pre-Trump paradigm. A post-Trump victory may benefit LMT stock all the more.\n\nEssentially, America\u2019s European and Asian partners would have every reason to assume the worst; that is, the U.S. would turn a blind eye to Russian, Chinese, or perhaps even North Korean aggression. Almost certainly, that\u2019s a terrible outlook for geopolitical stability. However, it may be a massive win for LMT stock.\n\nLockheed Martin Benefits from a Sense of Urgency\n\nOf course, the acute nature of the proposed bullish case for LMT stock depends on a Trump victory. However, if the Democratic candidate wins (following President Biden\u2019s stepping down), Lockheed would still be relevant. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have indicated any serious interest in cutting U.S. defense spending.\n\nHowever, America\u2019s international partners would be able to breathe a sigh of relief if the left wins. The pressing urgency to rearm based on the world\u2019s lone superpower adopting an incoherent foreign policy would simply not exist.\n\nSo, how likely is it that former President Trump will win his second term? To be fair, polls need to be taken with a grain of salt, especially those conducted before September. For example, two years ago, pollsters predicted that a red wave would overwhelm the midterm elections. Experts anticipated a roaring lion; the American people received a screeching house cat.\n\nStill, it\u2019s more than fair to say that Trump and the Republicans have momentum on their side. President Biden simply did not perform well during the first debate. Naturally, the poor showing led many prominent Democrats to urge the president to step aside. And that has happened. However, now the left has an even more difficult task \u2014 finding an adequate ticket in a very limited time period.\n\nTrump only has to focus on winning over the American electorate, which makes his job objectively easier at this point. So, the money is on \u201cThe Donald\u201d to win a second term. In so doing, the world may see the U.S. shirk its traditional counterweight responsibility amid the rise of the new axis powers: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\nSure enough, the prospect of a second Trump term has sparked discourse about the pressing geopolitical situation. In Taiwan, concerns have been heightened about Trump\u2019s impact on the world stage, with many calling for increased defense spending. Broadly speaking, that should help LMT stock or, at the very least, put Lockheed in the discussion of an apparent global renaissance of security-focused expenditures.\n\nSimilar to the Democrats and their need for internal organization along with competing for the electorate, America\u2019s global partners face a two-front battle: the new axis powers rising in conjunction with an isolationist U.S. policy. Again, that\u2019s bad for geopolitical stability but great news for LMT stock as the urgency to arm up will skyrocket.\n\nAs recent news out of Taiwan demonstrates, U.S. partners are reading between the lines.\n\nIs Lockheed Martin Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, LMT stock has a Hold consensus rating based on one Buy, six Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average LMT stock price target is $497.00, implying 0.86% downside risk.\n\nSee more LMT analyst ratings\n\nThe Takeaway: Shifting Geopolitical Tides Bode Well for LMT Stock\n\nAmerica and its allies are entering a dangerous and unprecedented time. Ahead of the rise of the new axis powers, the traditional approach would have seen the U.S. rise to meet the challenge. Instead, a second Trump administration may see the U.S. avoiding conflict, even at the expense of acquiescence. Naturally, this framework has many nations worried, which might serve Lockheed Martin well. After all, a sense of urgency has entered the geopolitical arena, which may boost LMT stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $7.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.45 by 10.2%. The bottom line also improved 5.6% from the year-ago quarter's recorded figure of $6.73.\n\nThe company reported GAAP earnings of $6.85 per share compared with $6.63 in the prior-year period.\n\nThe year-over-year bottom-line improvement can be attributed to solid sales growth and operating profit improvement from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lockheed Martin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lockheed Martin Corporation Quote\n\nOperational Highlights\n\nNet sales were $18.12 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.10 billion by 6%. The top line also increased 8.6% from $16.69 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe year-over-year top-line improvement can be attributed to sales growth from each of the four company segments.\n\nBacklog\n\nLMT\u2019s backlog as of Jun 30, 2024, was $158.34 billion compared with $159.37 billion at the end of first-quarter 2024.\n\nOur model projected a backlog worth $179.34 billion for the second quarter.\n\nThe Aeronautics segment accounted for $53.03 billion of the total backlog amount, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $37.36 billion. The Missiles and Fire Control segment contributed $34.83 billion, while the Space unit accounted for $33.11 billion.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nAeronautics: Sales improved 5.8% year over year to $7.28 billion. This was driven by sales growth from a higher volume on sustainment, development and production contracts for F-35 program, and ramped-up production of the F-16 program.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit improved 4.6% year over year to $751 million. The operating margin, however, contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 10.3%.\n\nMissiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales improved a solid 12.6% year over year to $3.10 billion. This was on account of higher sales from tactical and strike missile programs, driven by a production ramp-up of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (\u201cGMLRS\u201d) and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (\u201cLRASM\u201d) programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit increased 21.3% year over year to $450 million. The operating margin of 14.5% expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nSpace: Sales rose 0.9% year over year to $3.20 billion due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, driven by higher volume of the hypersonics and Fleet Ballistic Missile (\u201cFBM\u201d) programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 10.9% to $346 million. The operating margin expanded 90 bps to 10.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nRotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly revenues improved 16.7% to $4.55 billion on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by higher net sales from integrated warfare systems and sensors programs. Higher net sales from Sikorsky helicopter programs also aided this segment\u2019s top line.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 9% to $495 million in the reported quarter. The operating margin, however, deteriorated 70 bps to 10.9% in the said time frame.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nLockheed\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.52 billion at the end of second-quarter 2024 compared with $1.44 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nCash from operating activities amounted to $3.51 billion as of Jun 31, 2024, compared with $2.66 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nLong-term debt as of Jun 30, 2024, totaled $19.12 billion, up from $17.29 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nLockheed has partially raised its financial guidance for 2024. The company now expects to generate revenues in the range of $70.50-$71.50 billion, up from the prior guidance of $68.50-$70.00 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $69.80 billion, which lies below the company\u2019s updated guided range.\n\nLMT currently expects 2024 earnings per share (EPS) to be in the range of $26.10-$26.60, up from the earlier guidance of $25.65-$26.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s full-year EPS is pinned at $26.20, lower than the mid-point of the company\u2019s updated guidance.\n\nLockheed still expects to generate free cash flow in the range of $6.00-$6.30 billion and incur capital expenditures of $1.75 billion during 2024.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nLMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRecent Defense Releases\n\nHexcel Corporation HXL reported second-quarter 2024 earnings of 60 cents per share, which improved 20% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure of 50 cents.\n\nThe company\u2019s net sales totaled $500.4 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $482 million by 3.8%.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) came out with quarterly earnings of $7.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.45 per share. This compares to earnings of $6.73 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this aerospace and defense company would post earnings of $5.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.33, delivering a surprise of 9.14%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nLockheed , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, posted revenues of $18.12 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $16.69 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nLockheed shares have added about 4.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 16.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Lockheed?\n\nWhile Lockheed has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lockheed: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $6.43 on $17.37 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $26.20 on $69.8 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense is currently in the top 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, RTX (RTX), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on July 25.\n\nThis an aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nRTX's revenues are expected to be $19.31 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Reports Bullish Q2, Full-Year Sales Guidance Is Optimistic\n\nSecurity and Aerospace company Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) reported Q2 CY2024 results exceeding Wall Street analysts' expectations , with revenue up 8.6% year on year to $18.12 billion. The company's full-year revenue guidance of $71 billion at the midpoint also came in 1.8% above analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $7.11 per share, improving from its profit of $6.73 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Lockheed Martin? Find out in our full research report.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Q2 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $18.12 billion vs analyst estimates of $17.01 billion (6.5% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $7.11 vs analyst estimates of $6.45 (10.3% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 11.8%, down from 12.5% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $1.51 billion, up 19.8% from the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $113.9 billion\n\n\"Over the past few months, Lockheed Martin's people, systems, and platforms have again demonstrated their ability to enhance security in Eastern Europe, the Red Sea, and the Middle East. From the PAC-3's critical role in air defense, to the Aegis Combat System with AI augmentation, to the F-35 with its advanced sensor and data management capabilities, our company has made major contributions to allied and partner defense. We continue to demonstrate the impact of our 21st Century Security\u00ae strategy by harnessing the latest digital technologies to continuously improve mission effectiveness, strengthening and scaling the defense production system, and expanding industrial cooperation among our allies and partners. Consequently, demand for our defense technology solutions remains robust, with a backlog of nearly $160 billion, greater than two times annual revenue,\" said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Jim Taiclet.\n\nHeadquartered in Maryland, Famous for the F-35 aircraft, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) specializes in defense, space, homeland security, and information technology products.\n\nDefense Contractors\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales Growth\n\nExamining a company's long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Unfortunately, Lockheed Martin's 4.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This shows it failed to expand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Lockheed Martin Total Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Lockheed Martin's annualized revenue growth of 5.2% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was consistently weak.\n\nThis quarter, Lockheed Martin reported solid year-on-year revenue growth of 8.6%, and its $18.12 billion of revenue outperformed Wall Street's estimates by 6.5%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability. It\u2019s the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses\u2013everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. Operating margin is also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\n\nLockheed Martin has been an optimally run company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the industrials sector, boasting an average operating margin of 13%.\n\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Lockheed Martin's annual operating margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points over the last five years. Even though its margin is still high, shareholders will want to see Lockheed Martin become more profitable in the future. Lockheed Martin Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q2, Lockheed Martin generated an operating profit margin of 11.9%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company's overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n\nEPS\n\nAnalyzing long-term revenue trends tells us about a company's historical growth, but the long-term change in its earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth\u2013for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nLockheed Martin's EPS grew at an unimpressive 6.5% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This performance was better than its 4.3% annualized revenue growth but doesn't tell us much about its day-to-day operations because its operating margin didn't expand. Lockheed Martin EPS (Adjusted)\n\nDiving into the nuances of Lockheed Martin's earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. A five-year view shows that Lockheed Martin has repurchased its stock, shrinking its share count by 15.6%. This tells us its EPS outperformed its revenue not because of increased operational efficiency but financial engineering, as buybacks boost per share earnings. Lockheed Martin Diluted Shares Outstanding\n\nLike with revenue, we also analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Lockheed Martin, its two-year annual EPS growth of 11.9% was higher than its five-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing industrials companies in recent history.\n\nIn Q2, Lockheed Martin reported EPS at $7.11, up from $6.73 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts' estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Lockheed Martin to perform poorly. Analysts are projecting its EPS of $28.11 in the last year to shrink by 5.3% to $26.61.\n\nKey Takeaways from Lockheed Martin's Q2 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly Lockheed Martin blew past analysts' revenue and EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance came in higher than Wall Street's estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a fantastic quarter that should have shareholders cheering. The stock remained flat at $478 immediately following the results.\n\nLockheed Martin may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.",

        "content": "By Pratyush Thakur and Mike Stone\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. defense company Lockheed Martin raised its annual sales target for the first time this year on Tuesday, following the unexpected resumption of deliveries of its F-35 aircraft after Pentagon began accepting the jets last week.\n\nThe U.S. resumed taking F-35 deliveries after a months-long pause due to delays on its software upgrade. Lockheed has been upgrading the jets under Technology Refresh 3, or TR-3 program, that gives the F-35 better displays and processing power.\n\nThe delivery resumption includes incomplete software upgrade and Pentagon will withhold some payment, the details of which is unknown, until the remaining enhancements are finished.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLockheed's F-35 is the world's largest defense program and contributes around 30% of the company's revenue.\n\n\"The F-35 remains a top priority, and we recently delivered the first TR-3-configured aircraft to the customer and anticipate deliveries for 2024 to meet our expected range of 75-110 F-35s,\" said CEO Jim Taiclet.\n\nTR-3 involves both hardware and software improvements and is seen as a pillar of a wider upgrade to the stealth jet known as Block 4. The enhancements \"are critical steps in ensuring the F-35 remains the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world and the key air vehicle node in the DoD's joint all domain architecture\", Taiclet said.\n\nLockheed, however, does not expect the full tech refresh package to be ready for months.\n\nIt expects 2024 sales to be between $70.5 billion and $71.5 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $68.5 billion to $70 billion.\n\nThe company also benefited from a $95-billion additional funding, which includes aid for Ukraine and Israel, approved by Congress.\n\nCombat in Ukraine and Israel has consumed high volumes of munitions, including Lockheed-made Patriot air defense interceptors, used to shoot down incoming hostile missiles.\n\nLockheed posted net income of $6.85 per share for the second quarter, compared with $6.63 per share a year earlier.\n\nTotal quarterly sales rose 8.5% to $18.12 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

(PRNewsFoto/Lockheed Martin)\n\n\"Over the past few months, Lockheed Martin's people, systems, and platforms have again demonstrated their ability to enhance security in Eastern Europe, the Red Sea, and the Middle East. From the PAC-3's critical role in air defense, to the Aegis Combat System with AI augmentation, to the F-35 with its advanced sensor and data management capabilities, our company has made major contributions to allied and partner defense. We continue to demonstrate the impact of our 21st Century Security\u00ae strategy by harnessing the latest digital technologies to continuously improve mission effectiveness, strengthening and scaling the defense production system, and expanding industrial cooperation among our allies and partners. Consequently, demand for our defense technology solutions remains robust, with a backlog of nearly $160 billion, greater than two times annual revenue,\" said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Jim Taiclet.\n\n\"We delivered strong second quarter financial results, with year-over-year growth of 9% in sales and 10% in segment operating profit, and free cash flow generation in excess of $1.5 billion. The year-to-date performance gives us confidence to raise our 2024 full-year outlook for sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share. Operationally, the F-35 remains a top priority, and we recently delivered the first Technology Refresh 3-configured aircraft to the customer and anticipate deliveries for 2024 to meet our expected range of 75-110 F-35s. The TR-3 hardware and software update enables step function improvement in capability to our airmen, sailors, and marines, as well as to our partner and allied nations.\u00a0 This foundational upgrade and the follow-on series of enhancements, known as Block 4, are critical steps in ensuring the F-35 remains the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world and the key air vehicle node in the DoD's joint all domain architecture.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSummary Financial Results\n\nThe following table presents the company's summary financial results.\n\n(in\u00a0millions, except per share data) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 18,122 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,693 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 35,317 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 31,819 Business segment operating profit1 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,042 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,855 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,787 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,537 Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment 406 416 812 831 Impairment and severance charges2 (87) \u2014 (87) \u2014 Intangible asset amortization expense (61) (62) (122) (124) Other, net (152) (74) (213) (72) Total unallocated items 106 280 390 635 Consolidated operating profit $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,148 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,135 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,177 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,172 Net earnings3 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,641 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,681 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,186 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,370 Diluted earnings per share3 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.85 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.63 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.24 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.24 Cash from operations4 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,876 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,100 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,511 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,664 Capital expenditures (370) (329) (748) (623) Free cash flow1,4 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,506 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 771 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,763 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,041 1 Business segment operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected. It is the company's practice not to incorporate adjustments into its financial outlook for proposed or potential acquisitions, divestitures, ventures, pension risk transfer transactions, financing transactions, changes in law, or new accounting standards until such items have been consummated, enacted or adopted. For additional factors that may impact the company's actual results, refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section in this news release.\n\n(in\u00a0millions, except per share data) Current Update April 2024 Net sales $70,500 - $71,500 $68,500 - $70,000 Business segment operating profit1 $7,350 - $7,500 $7,175 - $7,375 Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment ~$1,685 ~$1,685 Diluted earnings per share2 $26.10 - $26.60 $25.65 - $26.35 Cash from operations $7,750 - $8,050 $7,750 - $8,050 Capital expenditures ~$1,750 ~$1,750 Free cash flow1 $6,000 - $6,300 $6,000 - $6,300 1 Business segment operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. See the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this news release for more information. 2 Although the company typically does not update its outlook for proposed changes in law, the above includes the effect of IRS Notice 2023-63 confirming that certain expenditures incurred in the performance of cost-type contracts are not subject to capitalization for tax purposes. The company believes incorporating the clarification from the Notice more accurately reflects its expectations because the Notice describes the tax treatment of certain expenditures in accordance with the company's analysis of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nCash Flows and Capital Deployment Activities\n\nThe increase in operating and free cash flows in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to improvements in working capital (defined as receivables, contract assets, and inventories less accounts payable and contract liabilities) and the timing of federal tax payments. Improvements in working capital were driven by volume and timing of milestone payments impacting both contract liabilities and contract assets on classified programs at the company's Space business segment, decreases in inventory due to deliveries of S-70 helicopters at Sikorsky at the company's RMS business segment, and production and billing cycle timing impacting receivables (primarily F-35 at Aeronautics and Integrated Air and Missile Defense at MFC, partially offset by Integrated warfare systems and sensors at RMS). These improvements were partially offset by the timing of cash payments related to accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics).\n\nThe company's cash activities in the second quarter of 2024, included the following:\n\npaying cash dividends of $752 million; paying $850 million to repurchase 1.9 million shares; and making a long-term debt scheduled repayment of $168 million.\n\nSegment Results\n\nThe company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. The following table presents summary operating results of the company's business segments and reconciles these amounts to the company's consolidated financial results.\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales Aeronautics $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,277 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,875 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14,122 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13,144 Missiles and Fire Control 3,102 2,755 6,095 5,143 Rotary and Mission Systems 4,548 3,897 8,636 7,407 Space  3,195 3,166 6,464 6,125 Total net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 18,122 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,693 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 35,317 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 31,819 Operating profit Aeronautics $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 751 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 718 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,430 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,393 Missiles and Fire Control 450 371 761 748 Rotary and Mission Systems  495 454 925 804 Space  346 312 671 592 Total business segment operating\n\nprofit 2,042 1,855 3,787 3,537 Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment  406 416 812 831 Impairment and severance charges  (87) \u2014 (87) \u2014 Intangible asset amortization\n\nexpense (61) (62) (122) (124) Other, net (152) (74) (213) (72) Total unallocated items 106 280 390 635 Total consolidated operating profit $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,148 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,135 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,177 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,172\n\nFor information on factors impacting comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and operating margins, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\u00a0Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nThe company's consolidated net favorable profit booking rate adjustments represented approximately 21% and 20% of total segment operating profit in the quarters ended June\u00a030, 2024 and June\u00a025, 2023.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $420 million on integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to higher volume on radar programs and the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) program, and new program ramp up within the laser systems portfolio; and $160 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher production volume on Black Hawk and CH-53K programs.\n\nRMS' operating profit in the second quarter of 2024 increased $41 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2023.\u00a0The increase in operating profit was attributable to $70 million from higher volume described above, partially offset by $20 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments. The decrease in profit booking rate adjustments was due to unfavorable profit adjustments on Seahawk and Black Hawk production programs as a result of increased costs, partially offset by the net impact in the second quarter of 2023 of both a $65 million favorable profit adjustment on an international surveillance and control program and a $100 million unfavorable profit adjustment on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP) that did not recur in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nSpace\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,195 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,166 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,464 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,125 Operating profit 346 312 671 592 Operating margin 10.8\u00a0% 9.9\u00a0% 10.4\u00a0% 9.7\u00a0%\n\nSpace's net sales in the second quarter of 2024 increased $29 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $110 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume on the hypersonics and Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) programs; partially offset by lower net sales of $50 million for national security space due to lower volume on classified programs and $45 million for commercial civil space due to lower volume on the Orion program.\n\nSpace's operating profit in the second quarter of 2024 increased $34 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2023.\u00a0The increase in operating profit was attributable to $20 million from favorable contract mix across the portfolio and $20 million of higher profit booking rate adjustments. The increase in profit booking rate adjustments was due to higher favorable profit adjustments on the FBM program.\n\nTotal equity earnings/(losses) (primarily ULA) represented approximately $10 million, or 3% of Space's operating profit in the second quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $20 million, or 6% for the same period in 2023.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe company's effective income tax rate was 15.8% and 16.2% for the quarters ended June\u00a030, 2024 and June\u00a025, 2023. The rates for both periods benefited from research and development tax credits, tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income and dividends paid to the company's\u00a0defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis news release contains the following non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures (as defined by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation G). While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating the financial performance of the company, this information should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's definitions for non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies or analysts.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit\n\nBusiness segment operating profit represents operating profit from the company's business segments before unallocated income and expense. This measure is used by the company's senior management in evaluating the performance of its business segments and is a performance goal in the company's annual incentive plan. Business segment operating margin is calculated by dividing business segment operating profit by sales. The table below reconciles the non-GAAP measure business segment operating profit with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, consolidated operating profit.\n\n(in millions) Current Update April 2024 Business segment operating profit (non-GAAP) $7,350 - $7,500 $7,175 - $7,375 FAS/CAS operating adjustment1 ~1,625 ~1,625 Intangible asset amortization expense ~(245) ~(245) Other, net2 ~(530) ~(400) Consolidated operating profit (GAAP) ~$8,200 - 8,350 ~$8,155 - $8,355 1 Reflects the amount by which expected total CAS pension cost of $1.7 billion, exceeds the expected FAS pension service cost and excludes expected non-service FAS pension income. Refer to the supplemental table \"Selected Financial Data\" included in this news release for a detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. 2 Includes impairment and severance charges of $87\u00a0million ($69\u00a0million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) for trademark and fixed asset impairments as well as severance costs recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nFree cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is cash from operations less capital expenditures. The company's capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). The company uses free cash flow to evaluate its business performance and overall liquidity and it is a performance goal in the company's annual and long-term incentive plans. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions or other investments. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and future pension contributions.\n\nAdjusted earnings before income taxes; adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS\n\nEarnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were impacted by certain non-operational items for all periods. Management believes the presentation of these measures adjusted for the impacts of these non-operational items is useful to investors in understanding the company's underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period. The tax effects related to each adjustment that impacted earnings before income taxes are based on a blended tax rate that combines the federal statutory rate of 21% plus an estimated state tax rate.\n\nThe table below shows the impact to earnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted EPS for certain non-operational items:\n\n(in\u00a0millions, except per share data) Quarters Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Earnings Before\r\nIncome Taxes Net Earnings Diluted EPS Earnings Before\r\nIncome Taxes Net Earnings Diluted EPS As Reported (GAAP) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,948 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,641 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.85 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,006 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,681 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.63 Impairment and severance charges 87 69 0.29 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Mark-to-market investment (gains) losses (8) (6) (0.03) 28 21 0.08 Debt transactions costs \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6 5 0.02 Total Adjustments 79 63 0.26 34 26 0.10 As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,027 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,704 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7.11 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,040 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,707 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.73\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation will webcast live the earnings results conference call (listen-only mode) on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. ET on the Lockheed Martin Investor Relations website at www.lockheedmartin.com/investor.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in evening deals on Monday, steadying after a sharp rebound on Wall Street as investors returned to technology stocks ahead of key earnings from the sector.\n\nWall Street indexes were still trading well below record highs hit last week, as a mix of profit-taking and rotation into more economically-sensitive sectors battered tech in recent sessions.\n\nThe second quarter earnings season is now widely expected to dictate tech\u2019s trajectory in the coming weeks.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,605.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 19,955.75 points by 19:51 ET (23:51 GMT). Dow Jones Futures were flat at 40,680.0 points.\n\nAlphabet, Tesla set to report Q2 earnings\n\nFocus was now squarely on upcoming earnings prints from tech majors Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), due on Tuesday.\n\nAlphabet is set to offer more cues on how Wall Street\u2019s internet giants are benefiting from artificial intelligence, as well as how much they are spending on developing the new technology.\n\nTesla\u2019s earnings are set to show how the electric vehicle maker is navigating a sharp decrease in demand, while focus will also be on its promises of AI-driven autonomous driving and robotaxis.\n\nBeyond the two tech giants, a slew of other Wall Street majors are set to report on Tuesday, including Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and Freeport-McMoran Copper&Gold Inc (NYSE:FCX).\n\nWall St benefits from tech rebound, but uncertainties persist\n\nA large rotation back into technology stocks saw Wall Street rebound on Monday, although benchmark indexes still remained well below recent peaks.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 1.1% to 5,564.41 points, while the NASDAQ Composite surged 1.6% to 18,007.57 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 40,415.44 points.\n\nGrowing optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September saw investors pivot into sectors more likely to benefit from an economic recovery.\n\nBut uncertainty over the U.S. political outlook increased after President Joe Biden said he will not seek reelection, instead endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nRecent polls showed Republican nominee Donald Trump was polling ahead of Biden and Harris, although it was unclear whether Harris\u2019 nomination will shift this trend.\n\nSpeculation over a Trump presidency also drove flows into economically sensitive sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures dip after tech rebound; Alphabet, Tesla earnings loom\n\nUS congressional panel calls on CrowdStrike CEO to testify on outage\n\nPorsche lowers 2024 outlook, warns of impairments on alloy shortage",

        "title": "Investing in Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) three years ago would have delivered you a 40% gain",
        "content": "By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shareholders have seen the share price rise 29% over three years, well in excess of the market return (14%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 6.9%, including dividends.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nLockheed Martin was able to grow its EPS at 4.0% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Lockheed Martin has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Lockheed Martin, it has a TSR of 40% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nLockheed Martin provided a TSR of 6.9% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 8% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with Lockheed Martin .\n\nStory continues\n\nWe will like Lockheed Martin better if we see some big insider buys.

With 545+ Super Hercules delivered worldwide, this achievement reflects the C-130J's unmatched global reach, multi-mission versatility and proven tactical performance capabilities. Lockheed Martin announced today at Farnborough International Airshow that the global C-130J Super Hercules fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. (Photo by Thinh D. Nguyen)\n\nOperators and crews from 21 nations contributed to this achievement, logging hours through 18 different mission requirements including combat, transport, aerial refueling, Special Operations, medevac, humanitarian relief, search and rescue, weather reconnaissance, firefighting and commercial freight delivery.\n\n\"From the highest landing strip in the world to the snow-packed runways of Antarctica and all the many mission locations in between, these 3 million hours represent the proven power and wide-reaching presence of the C-130J's global fleet,\" said Rod McLean, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin's Air Mobility & Maritime Missions line of business. \"In celebrating this achievement, we also honor the many crew members, maintainers and airlift partners who truly keep the global Super Hercules fleet ready for any and every mission requirement.\"\n\n3 million hours by the numbers\n\nThese hours were logged beginning with the C-130J's first flight on April 5, 1996, through the beginning of July 2024. Countries with C-130Js contributing to these flight hours include (in order of delivery) the United Kingdom, United States (the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard; Pallas Aviation), Australia, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Canada, India, Qatar, Iraq, Oman, Tunisia, Israel, Kuwait, South Korea, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, France, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Germany. Also contributing to these flight hours is the Lockheed Martin Flight Operations team, whose crews are the first to fly every C-130J produced, and the U.S. Air Force Defense Contract Management Agency crews that support C-130J test flights at Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics site in Marietta, Georgia, home of Super Hercules production line. Super Hercules variants used to log these hours include: C-130J and C-130J-30 (tactical airlifter), KC-130J (tanker), WC-130J (weather reconnaissance), EC-130J (information operations), MC-130J (Special Operations), HC-130J (search and rescue, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard variants), AC-130J (gunship) and LM-100J (commercial freighter). Hours flown include test, training and operational missions on all seven continents.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlways evolving, continually innovating and ready for what's next, the Super Hercules leads the charge by setting standards and shaping the future of tactical airlift missions, offering a multitude of advantages found in no other medium-sized tactical airlifter in production or operation today.\n\nThese discriminators include proven operational readiness with the greatest ease of transition, increased reliability, superior tactical airlift and combat airdrop capabilities, certification by more than 20 airworthiness authorities, and engine-out performance with extended range. The C-130J also delivers unmatched interoperability with NATO and global air forces, robust industrial partnerships and verified low life-cycle costs with significant fuel savings resulting in a reduced carbon footprint compared to other medium-sized jet airlifters.\n\nSee how and why the C-130J continues to be the worldwide choice in tactical airlift through the newest episode of\u00a0\"Into the Cockpit\" on Lockheed Martin's YouTube channel, which offers exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the Super Hercules.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin \r\nLockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) Reports Earnings Tomorrow: What To Expect\n\nSecurity and Aerospace company Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will be reporting earnings tomorrow before market open. Here's what you need to know.\n\nLockheed Martin beat analysts' revenue expectations by 7.5% last quarter, reporting revenues of $17.2 billion, up 13.7% year on year. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Lockheed Martin a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Lockheed Martin's revenue to grow 1.9% year on year to $17.01 billion, slowing from the 8.1% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $6.45 per share. Lockheed Martin Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Lockheed Martin has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Lockheed Martin's peers in the aerospace and defense segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Hexcel delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 10.1%, beating analysts' expectations by 3%, and AAR reported revenues up 18.7%, in line with consensus estimates. Hexcel traded down 7.5% following the results while AAR was also down 12.1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Hexcel's results here and AAR's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the aerospace and defense segment, with share prices up 4.5% on average over the last month. Lockheed Martin's stock price was unchanged during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $492.4 (compared to the current share price of $474.0).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

The company had Q1 2024 net sales of $17.2 billion, a 14% increase annually. Adjusting for the extra calendar week, the normalized sales growth was 5%. This growth was primarily driven by higher volumes across its business segments, particularly in aeronautics, missiles and fire control (MFC).

Despite this, Lowe\u2019s strategic agility allowed it to capitalize on\u00a0crucial\u00a0categories like outdoor power equipment, which\u00a0was\u00a0enhanced\u00a0by partnerships such as the launch of Toro products.\n\nThis\u00a0expanded Lowe\u2019s market appeal and customer base. Lowe\u2019s Total Home strategy, emphasizing professional (Pro) and online sales growth, yielded positive outcomes in Q1. Pro sales have\u00a0been boosted\u00a0by strategic investments in service improvements and expanded brand portfolios like Klein Tools.

Moreover, the national rollout of MyLowe\u2019s Rewards program further enhanced customer loyalty and personalized shopping experiences.\n\nLowe\u2019s is included in the election stocks to buy list for its strategic adaptations in a competitive retail environment.\n\nLennar (LEN) len stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nLennar (NYSE:LEN) is the largest homebuilder in the U.S. The company can maintain consistent production and sales numbers, which is vital for scalability and efficiency in the homebuilding industry. In Q2 2024, Lennar started approximately 21,400 homes, sold about 21,300 homes, and delivered around 19,700 homes. This near alignment between starts, sales and deliveries (with slight variations) indicates sharp operational planning and execution.\n\nMoreover, margin management is another strength highlighted by Lennar. The company attained a margin of\u00a022.6% in Q2, which is sequentially up from 21.8% in the previous quarter. Lennar\u00a0targets around 23% margin for Q3 2024.

        "title": "Exclusive-US-Japan Patriot missile production plan hits Boeing component roadblock",
        "content": "By Nobuhiro Kubo and Tim Kelly\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S. plan to use Japanese factories to boost production of Patriot air defence missiles - used by Ukraine to defend against Russian attacks - is being delayed by a shortage of a critical component manufactured by Boeing, four sources said.\n\nJapan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) already makes about 30 PAC-3 missiles each year under licence from defence contractor Lockheed Martin and can increase that number to about 60, two Japanese government officials and two industry sources told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. hopes to increase production from about 500 a year to more than 750 per year globally as soon as possible, a person familiar with the program said. But no expansion at all will be possible in Japan without additional supplies of the missiles' seekers, which guide them in the final stages of flight, the officials and industry sources said.\n\n\"It could take several years before MHI is able to raise output\" because of the shortage, said one of the industry sources, who like the others declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nThe production snag in Japan shows the challenges Washington faces in plugging industrial help from its global allies into its complex supply chains.\n\nBoeing last year began expanding its seeker factory in the United States to increase production by 30%, although the additional lines won't operate until 2027. The company did not say last year how many were produced, but noted it had just delivered its 5,000th.\n\nA Boeing representative referred questions to Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the interceptor.\n\nLockheed Martin has said it is increasing its U.S. output of Patriot interceptors from 500 to 650 by 2027. Each costs about $4 million.\n\nEven if enough seekers are available, expanding annual PAC-3 production in Japan beyond 60 would require MHI to build more capacity.\n\nIn its 2022 plan to double military spending, Japan's government said it would offer financial help to defence companies that wanted to expand production. Those subsidies, however, only apply to equipment destined for the country's Self Defense Forces and not exports.\n\nThat means that MHI or the United States would have to stump up the money to pay for a new PAC-3 factory, which could cost tens of millions of dollars or more, one of the Japanese government sources said.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is a large area of focus for the U.S. and our allies and strategically postured capabilities in the region are critical to support deterrence and maintain readiness,\" Lockheed Martin said in an email, referring questions about PAC-3 production in Japan to the Japanese and U.S. governments, and MHI.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan's Ministry of Defense declined to comment. MHI declined to comment.\n\nA U.S. defence official said a $4.5 billion contract signed in June with the U.S. Army - the Patriot system's primary customer - marked the beginning of a ramp-up in production of both missiles and seekers.\n\nForeign and defence ministers from Japan and the United States are set to meet in Tokyo this month for talks that are expected to include deepening industrial cooperation on defence. The Patriot project is seen as a key part of that effort.\n\nEven with help from allies, supply chain bottlenecks complicate U.S. efforts to supply Ukraine's demand for munitions, including air defence systems that can thwart Russian attacks.\n\nIn the deadliest wave of air strikes in months, a Russian missile in July struck a children's hospital, killing at least 41 civilians.\n\nIn December 2023, Japan eased military export rules to allow it to help replenish U.S. Patriot missile stocks, which had been tapped to help Ukraine.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who called that a \"historic decision\", has been a leading proponent of deeper military industrial ties with Japan that could ease the strain on U.S. defence contractors.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida agreed in April to deepen defence industry cooperation.\n\nIn an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal two months after that meeting, Emanuel described a shrunken U.S. military industrial complex as a \"weak link\" that had been exposed by the Ukraine war and the Middle East conflict.\n\n(Reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo, Tim Kelly; additional reporting by Mike Stone, Allison Lampert, Idrees Ali and Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Sam Holmes)",

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Buy if Biden Wins in November",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that since the start of the Biden administration 2020, America\u2019s involvement in foreign wars has increased. Whether through funding or covert operations, America is once more active on the global stage as a supplier and supporter of foreign wars. Whatever your perspectives on this might be, it does lend itself to a lucrative military-industrial complex. As such, investors may want to consider which defense stocks to buy in the event of four more years of the Biden administration.\n\nThe companies selected for this discussion are those actively producing weapons and materials for the current major wars in Ukraine and Israel. They are also companies that have actively funded and supported the Biden campaign, and are likely to receive preferential treatment in the event of his reelection. Thus, these are three defense stocks to buy should the Democrats win reelection in the presidency, and continue their foreign policy of supporting long-term wars.\n\nBAE Systems (BAESY) BAE Systems' (BAESY) M777 155mm Ultra light towed howitzer at Eurosatory 2008 military exhibition\n\nSource: Flying Camera / Shutterstock.com\n\nShould the war in Ukraine continue to drag on, BAE Systems (OTCMKTS:BAESY) is likely one of the biggest beneficiaries due to the multitude of technologies it supplies to the Ukrainian army through Western aid packages. Two prominent examples are the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle and the M777 howitzer, both of which have been considered instrumental tools for the Ukrainians in their war against Russia.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, since the start of the war in February 2022, BAE Systems has seen its stock soar by 49%. Thanks to the demand generated by an active war for its artillery systems and armored vehicles, BAE currently retains the investor favor that has led to its successful run in the market over the past two years. This would make it one of the defense stocks to buy in the event of a second Biden administration, as it would likely prolong the war.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the producer of one of the most famous weapons of the current Russo-Ukrainian war, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stands to gain a lot more revenue generation should Biden win a second term and prolong the war in Ukraine. That\u2019s because LMT is the primary producer of the Javelin antitank missile system. With this weapon being considered so instrumental to the war in Ukraine, it\u2019s practically guaranteed that LMT will fulfill its current contract to supply even more missiles and launchers to the Ukrainian army.\n\nBeyond this weapon system, Lockheed Martin also stands to gain from Biden\u2019s strong willingness to supply NATO with the F-35, and the necessary components to keep them running. This multi-million dollar aircraft is one of Lockheed Martin\u2019s biggest revenue drivers of the 21st century. Thus, should Biden win the coming presidential election, LMT remains as one of the best defense stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top five defense contractors in the world Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) currently has a critical contract with its new B-21 raider bomber which is likely to maintain its funding status, so long as the current government stays in power. Thus, a Biden victory would likely result in a more willing spending environment that would continue to raise the national debt in order to cover many of Northrop Grumman\u2019s major programs.\n\nMoreover, the company recently became the first U.S. weapons manufacturer to strike a deal with the Ukrainian government to produce medium-caliber ammunition for things like autocannons and Gatling guns to aid Ukraine in its war effort.\n\nIf Biden wins the presidency again, this deal will likely be even more lucrative for the company as the Ukrainian government and surrounding nations are likely to become a long-time customer. This, paired with NOC\u2019s successes in the space sector through its International Space Station refueling program and reconnaissance satellites, makes it one of the best defense stocks to buy in the case of an interventionist executive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) major players\u2014Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)\u2014experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cQuite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk\u2019s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla\u2019s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot\u2019s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure\u2019s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n\u201cIn an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that\u2019s been a blocker for many large-scale deals \u2013 though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,\u201d Post said. \u201cMoreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.\u201d\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJer\u00f3nimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestl\u00e9 (NESNE.SW)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLMT, America\u2019s largest defense contractor, has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.07%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lockheed this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nLockheed Martin has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.59%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nA potential solid sales improvement from each of LMT\u2019s four business segments is likely to have bolstered the company\u2019s top-line performance.\n\nAeronautics to Post Solid Sales\n\nThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets, and contributes almost 40% to the company\u2019s top line, is likely to deliver impressive second-quarter results.\r\n\r\nA ramp-up in the production of the F-16 program, along with higher sales volume from production, development and sustainment contracts for the F-35 program, is likely to have bolstered this segment\u2019s top line. Higher sales volume from classified programs might have also boosted this unit\u2019s revenues.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aeronautics unit\u2019s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $6,915.9 million, indicating a 0.6% rise from the prior-year period\u2019s reported figure.\n\nImpressive Projections From Other Segments\n\nThe remaining three segments are also projected to have performed favorably in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nHigher sales volume from the fleet ballistic missile program, as well as that from space development agency transport and tracking layer programs, must have boosted the Space segment\u2019s top line.\u00a0 Also, a production ramp-up of hypersonic and next-generation interceptor programs might have contributed favorably to this segment\u2019s revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s revenues is pinned at $3,176.8 million, indicating a 0.3% improvement from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nLMT\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control (\u201cMFC\u201d) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies. A higher sales volume from tactical and strike missile programs, as well as integrated air and missile defense, is likely to have benefited this unit\u2019s quarterly sales performance.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC\u2019s second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $2,906.8 million, indicating 5.5% growth from the top line recorded a year ago.\n\nHigher sales volume from the Sikorsky unit, particularly driven by CH-53K, Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, is likely to have bolstered the Rotary and Mission Systems (\u201cRMS\u201d) segment\u2019s sales in the quarter under review.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RMS\u2019 revenues is currently pegged at $4,013.8 million, indicating a 3% improvement from the top line registered in the prior-year quarter.\n\nExpenses to Consider\n\nHigher interest expenses remain a headwind for the majority of U.S. companies, with Lockheed Martin being no exception. Since no reduction has been made in the nation\u2019s interest rate in recent times, notable interest expenses can be expected to have weighed on LMT\u2019s second-quarter earnings.\n\nOur model estimate for second-quarter interest expenses is $298.9 million, reflecting a solid 34% increase year over year.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, LMT recognized a reach-forward loss of $100 million associated with a classified missile program at its MFC unit, thereby bringing the cumulative losses recognized on the program to approximately $150 million.\n\nWith a potential loss of $1.3 billion associated with this program, LMT is expected to have incurred a notable loss in the second quarter as well. This, in turn, must have adversely impacted its margin performance and, thereby, bottom-line growth.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s shares have exhibited an upward trend, gaining a notable percentage over the year-to-date period. Specifically, the stock soared 5% year to date, outperforming the Zacks aerospace-defense industry\u2019s decline of 9.9%.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs evident from the image, other notable stocks from the same industry have also rallied year to date and comfortably outpaced the industry\u2019s performance. Shares of General Dynamics GD and L3Harris Technologies LHX have risen 12.9% each, while that of Textron TXT rallied 15.1%.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, LMT is trading at a relatively cheaper level when compared to its industry. Currently, LMT is trading at 17.35X forward 12 months earnings, which is lower than the industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple of 18.83X. However, its five-year median is 15.70X. So, the company\u2019s valuation looks somewhat stretched compared with its own range.\n\nLMT\u2019s Price-to-Earnings (forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nWith geopolitical tensions looming hard in the global map lately, defense contractors like Lockheed Martin have succeeded in clinching major orders for its varied products in recent quarters. This, in turn, can be expected to have boosted its second-quarter revenues. Revenues earned from sustainment contracts for providing valuable services of its renowned products like the F-35 fighter jet and Black Hawk helicopters must have also contributed to its top-line growth.\n\nBacked by its solid top-line prospects, the company has been offering notable rewards to its shareholders. Impressively, LMT\u2019s dividend yield of 2.65% outpaces that of S&P 500 (1.25%).\n\nHowever, increasing interest expenses remain a major headwind for the company\u2019s near-term bottom-line growth. These might have also contributed to LMT\u2019s elevated leverage, as evident from its long-term debt-to-capital ratio. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould You Buy LMT Now?\n\nDespite the few challenges faced by Lockheed Martin at present, it might not be a risk to make an entry for this stock, before coming Tuesday. This is because it is trading at a discount compared to its industry. This renowned fighter jet maker is less likely to disappoint with its second-quarter results, considering the upward revision in its earnings estimates as well as a positive Earnings ESP.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 0.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nLockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.8%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.38 indicates a change of +8.3% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $17.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.4%. The $69.8 billion and $72.49 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.3% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Lockheed Martin (LMT) ending at $476.07, denoting a +1.6% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.39%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.6%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 2.77%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 1.87% over the past month. This has outpaced the Aerospace sector's gain of 1.64% and lagged the S&P 500's gain of 4.43% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Lockheed Martin in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on July 23, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $6.44, marking a 4.31% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $17.06 billion, up 2.19% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $26.27 per share and revenue of $69.76 billion, which would represent changes of -5.57% and +3.24%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.05% increase. Lockheed Martin is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Lockheed Martin currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.84. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 18.56.\n\nWe can also see that LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.39. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Aerospace - Defense industry stood at 1.78 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 102, this industry ranks in the top 41% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Boeing Company BA recently secured an order from Emirates SkyCargo, the cargo unit of Emirates Airlines, to supply five 777 Freighters. This contract win should significantly boost Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane business segment.\r\n\r\nWith the latest purchase, Emirates\u2019 order for Boeing\u2019s wide-body aircraft includes 10 777 Freighters.\n\nAbout 777 Freighters\n\nThe Boeing 777 Freighter is a very competent, wide-body twin-engine freighter that can carry more cargo than any other twin-engine cargo aircraft, with a maximum payload capacity of 112 tons (102 metric tons) and a range of 4,970 nautical miles (9,200 km).\r\n\r\nOwing to these capabilities, 20% of all air freight worldwide is transported by this Boeing freighter as of March 2024.\n\nBoeing\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nWith the rise of e-commerce, the revival of international trade and fleet modernization, the worldwide freighter aircraft market has been expanding significantly. This trend is further supported by the growing need for technologically advanced freight transport and increased demand for freight charter services.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Boeing forecasts the air cargo traffic, measured in revenue ton kilometers, to grow an average of 4.1% annually from 2022 to 2041. With freighters constituting approximately 70% of all air cargo traffic as of 2021, the aforementioned projection offers ample growth opportunities to Boeing, which enjoys an already established position in the freighter market. Impressively, BA provides more than 90% of the worldwide dedicated freighter capacity.\r\n\r\nOnce the 777-8 Freighter starts getting delivered in 2027, as expected, which comes with 30% lower fuel usage and emissions from similar kinds of freighters, Boeing will be able to grab an increased share of the air cargo traffic growth.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nApart from Boeing, other prominent aerospace players that have a strong presence in the freighter market and thus are also expected to gain from the growing air cargo traffic are mentioned below:\r\n\r\nAirbus Group EADSY: The company provides a range of freighters with different capacities and capabilities. Its A330-200F is a new-generation cargo aircraft, while A330P2F, A320P2F and A321P2F are passenger aircraft that have been converted to a freighter.\r\n\r\nAirbus has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 13.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EADSY\u2019s 2024 sales calls for an improvement of 6.9% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nTextron Inc. TXT: Its Cessna SkyCourier freighter is a multi-purpose twin-engine aircraft built for cargo transport. It transports diverse things efficiently because of its large cabin volume and high payload capacity. Its durable build, short takeoff capabilities and superior avionics make it an excellent choice for regional freight services.\r\n\r\nTextron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 5.7% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin Corp. LMT: Its LM-100J performs as a civil multi-purpose air freighter capable of rapid and efficient transport of cargo. Its superior avionics and durable build make it suitable for a variety of tasks, including humanitarian aid, disaster relief and logistics support.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 3.2% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past three months, shares of Boeing have risen 9.3% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 2.3%.

        "title": "General Dynamics (GD) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "General Dynamics (GD) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 24, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $11.48 billion, up 13.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Dynamics?\n\nFor General Dynamics, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.54%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that General Dynamics would post earnings of $2.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.88, delivering a surprise of -0.35%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nGeneral Dynamics doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, Lockheed Martin (LMT) is soon expected to post earnings of $6.44 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -4.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $17.06 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Lockheed has been revised 1.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.85%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "910th Airlift Wing to receive a total of eight Super Hercules tactical\u00a0airlifters\n\nMARIETTA, Ga., July 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) delivered the first of eight\u00a0C-130J-30 Super Hercules tactical airlifters assigned to the Ohio Youngstown Air Reserve Station, marking the addition of a new mission capability for the Super Hercules \u2015 the aerial spray mission.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Wins $500M Deal From Croatia: Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a contract worth $500 million from the Government of Croatia to supply eight UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, along with their associated spare parts and services. This award win boosts Lockheed\u2019s revenue generation prospects from its Sikorsky business unit, which has been one of the topmost pioneers in building military rotorcrafts.\n\nNow, before asserting whether it will be profitable to buy LMT\u2019s shares at present, let\u2019s delve into its year-to-date performance, growth prospects as well as risks (if any) to make an insightful decision.\n\nLMT Outperforms Industry & Sector\n\nShares of Lockheed have risen 3.3% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks aerospace-defense industry\u2019s decline of 12.1%. It has also outpaced the broader Zacks Aerospace sector\u2019s decline of 6.2% in the same time frame.\n\nA similar trend can be seen in the performance of LMT\u2019s competitors, RTX Corp. RTX, General Dynamics GD and L3Harris Technologies LHX, which have witnessed a surge of 23.2%, 12.3% and 14.1%, respectively, year to date.\n\nLMT\u2019s YTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Catalysts Benefiting Lockheed\n\nValuable Order Growth: Solid order growth, like the latest one from Croatia, has always been playing the role of a crucial growth catalyst for the United States\u2019 largest defense contractor. While a steady order flow reflects the notable demand that Lockheed\u2019s varied products enjoy in the global defense space, cumulative backlog arising out of those order flows strengthens the company\u2019s revenue generation prospects. Notably, Lockheed\u2019s total backlog came in at a record $159.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nImpressive Defense Budget: With the United States being the most prominent weapon exporter in the world, the nation\u2019s defense budget plays a vital role in bolstering the growth of U.S. defense contractors. It does so by offering notable funding support for research, innovation and development of more advanced arms and ammunitions.\n\nNotably, the fiscal 2025 U.S. defense budget, which includes funding of $850 billion for the U.S. Department of Defense, constitutes continuous funding support for many of Lockheed\u2019s significant programs, including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M as well as an enhanced emphasis on its advanced munitions programs, such as LRASM, Javelin and PAC-3, as well as the long-range hypersonic weapon.\n\nStable Financials Boosting Shareholder Value: Lockheed\u2019s cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2024 totaled $2.79 billion, while its current debt was $0.17 billion.\u00a0 So, it would be safe to conclude that the stock holds a strong solvency position, at least in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis solid financial position must have been encouraging Lockheed to reward its shareholders with solid dividend payouts. As of Mar 31, 2024, Lockheed paid out dividends worth $780 million to its shareholders.\n\nHeadwinds to Keep an Eye on\n\nDespite being a prominent defense contractor, Lockheed faces some notable industry challenges, like a shortage of skilled labor, with an aging workforce (particularly) being a major cause of concern. Per a study by the Aerospace Industries Association, 29% of the aerospace-defense industry\u2019s employees are above the age of 55, creating waves of retirement impact that are estimated to create a projected gap of 3.5 million workers by 2026. So, as aircraft manufacturers have started to ramp up their production rates, such labor shortages might affect aerospace stocks like Lockheed Martin.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce announced that it has added Lockheed to its \u201cunreliable entities list\u201d in connection with certain foreign military sales by the U.S. government to Taiwan, which involves Lockheed\u2019s products and services. China declared that it would impose certain sanctions against Lockheed, including a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that Lockheed had sold to Taiwan since September 2020.\n\nThe nation also implemented broad-based export restrictions on certain minerals used in the production, among other things, of semiconductors and missile systems. If China further restricts the export of these materials or imposes additional sanctions, Lockheed\u2019s business could be adversely impacted.\n\nWill LMT Continue to Grow?\n\nDespite the challenges mentioned above, one may remain optimistic about the company\u2019s near-term growth prospects. A quick sneak peek at its earnings and sales estimates reflects the same.\n\nUpbeat Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 sales reflects an improvement of 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively, year over year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings per share reflects an upward movement of 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past 90 days. The upward revision in earnings estimates indicates analysts\u2019 increasing confidence in the stock. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTrading at a Discount\n\nIn terms of valuation, LMT\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) is 17.09X, a discount to the industry\u2019s average of 18.36X. This suggests that investors will be paying a lower price than the company's expected earnings growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\nTo sum up, despite the challenges Lockheed is facing at present, this might be a favorable entry point for investors interested in this stock, considering the upward revisions in its earnings estimates, solid backlog count boosting its revenue prospects and its discounted valuation. LMT currently has a VGM Score of A, which indicates a strong performance.\n\nThose who already own this stock may continue to do so. This can be justified by the fact that LMT has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT): Is It a Good Aerospace and Defense Stock to Buy According to Analysts?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM) stands against the other aerospace and defense stocks.\n\nThe world has been rocked with conflict over the last few years. The war between Russia and Ukraine has gone beyond 860 days, with no immediate end in sight. Azerbaijan and Armenia continue to engage in a regular exchange of fire after the latter lost control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region to the Azeris in 2020. The Middle East is up in flames, with defense experts describing the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict as the worst crisis in the region since the Arab-Israeli War in 1973.\n\nWhile the human impacts of war are undeniably tragic, it is also a time when defense companies make money and lure investors into loading up on their stocks. According to a report on CNN earlier this year, defense companies in the United States and Europe have thrived since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. German automotive and arms manufacturer Rheinmetall\u2019s share price had surged by a staggering 315% in two years following the start of the conflict, while BAE Systems posted a 105% gain. Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin also witnessed an increase in their share prices by 18% and 10%, respectively.\n\nWhen the war broke out, industry analysts expected the aerospace sector to be affected by western sanctions placed on Russia. According to KPMG, the country is the source of 30% of the titanium used by Boeing and other large engine producers that power fighter jets and commercial aviation. Titanium is a key material that goes into the development of jet fan blades and landing gears. However, the supply of titanium from Russia to these companies has largely remained unaffected despite sanctions.\n\nWhile sharing his insights on commercial aviation at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago on June 26, Tony Bancroft from Gabelli Funds said that he had noticed a significant growth in aircraft orders lately, with both Airbus and Boeing having a 12-year backlog of orders. He believes there are three reasons driving it. The first catalyst, according to him, is China which accounts for 20% of the growth in orders to cater to the growing middle class in both China and India who want to travel more. Another critical factor he cited during his talk was that business travel has finally returned to the 2019 pre-pandemic level. Lastly, Tony highlighted the the rising middle class in the United States, and the world, which is increasing air travel and contributing to the economic growth in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Bancroft identified Textron as his hot stock pick in the aerospace and defense industry. He believes the stock is undervalued at its current share price of $85, and anticipates its value to hover around the $125 range in the future. Last year in March, the US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded a $1.3 billion contract to the company to develop helicopters to replace the aging Blackhawk fleet.\n\nAnother top stock that hedge funds are talking about is Carpenter Technology Corporation, a leading supplier of specialty alloys that holds a market share of roughly 40% in the aerospace industry. It was among the top picks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York back in April. Mohammed Anjarwala, the managing director of Advent Global Opportunities, shared the following remarks about the company during the conference:\n\nWe think Carpenter is one of the best ways to play the growing backlog of planes at Boeing and Airbus, as they ramp up their billing rates.\n\nAt the time of the conference, the stock was trading at around $70 per share. Anjarwala forecasted that the value could go up to around $200 per share or 20 times forward P/E. It is currently valued at $107 per share.\n\nMethodology\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of 920 hedge funds was assessed, as of the first quarter of 2024. We have chosen the 10 best aerospace and defense stocks to buy now based on the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 5 Countries with the Most Special-Mission Aircraft in the World\n\nA military aircraft in flight, showing the strength of the company's combat & air mobility capability.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor in the world, with over $67 billion in revenue in 2023, of which defense-related sales contributed 96%. The company was formed in 1995 after the merger between Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta and is famed for manufacturing several notable aircraft over the past decades, including the F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet. The corporation has worldwide interests and is the biggest recipient of DoD contracts in the United States.\n\nSince the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s share price has soared 29%. The stock is set for further gain with no end to the conflict in sight coupled with the aggravating situation in the Middle East. Earlier this year in April, the US government announced $61 billion in fresh aid for Ukraine and $26 billion for Israel. Most of the funds are likely to go into the procurement of pricey military equipment from companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). During the first quarter of 2024, the defense contractor posted an EPS of $6.39 per share, beating analyst estimates of $5.8, driven by strong demand for its weapons, especially HIMARS, GMLRS, and the F-35.\n\nAnalyst ratings for the stock fluctuate between Hold and Strong Buy, with an average share price target of $502, which is 9% higher than its current level of $460 per share. On the other hand, 47 hedge funds are bullish on the stock, according to Insider Monkey, making it one of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy now. Maria Ricciardone, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations shared confidence about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) being on track to meet full-year targets in the company\u2019s Q1 2024 Earnings Call:\n\nHighlights include robust funding for munitions multi-year procurement, continued investment in hypersonics and classified activities, and ongoing support for programs such as Black Hawk, CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, the fleet ballistic missile, C-130, and F-35. There were also additions to the original budget submission, including F-35 aircraft, C-130, and combat rescue helicopters. The initial budget request for FY2025, while still very early in the process, continues support of many of these same major programs, including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M, and others. In addition to emphasis on advanced munitions programs such as JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, Daimler, and PAC-3, as well as hypersonic conventional prompt strike and the long-range hypersonic weapon.\n\nOverall LMT ranks 6th on our list of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy.

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Sell if Trump Wins in November",
        "content": "Following the June 27 presidential debate, the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin, openly stated how seriously he takes former President Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. With Trump vocal about the importance of ending America\u2019s wars, it\u2019s likely the defense industry will take a hit following the closure of Europe\u2019s biggest war in almost 80 years. As a result, it\u2019s highly likely that there will be several defense stocks to sell to maximize profits now from medium-term holdings.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because these companies are financially insolvent or no longer relevant during a Trump presidency, but rather because they are not as heavily funded by the government as they are under the current Biden administration. As such, investors may want to prepare for the eventuality that the bull run the defense industry stocks had in 2022 and 2023 will likely come to an end should Trump and his foreign policies prevail in November.\n\nRTX (RTX) A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house.\n\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the defense stocks to sell with the most confidence from institutional investors, RTX (NYSE:RTX) has benefited greatly from the war in the Middle East. Today the company operates as a conglomerate of three major components, Raytheon Technologies, Collins Aerospace, and Pratt & Whitney. This results in a defense corporation whose revenue incomes are partially exposed to commercial market trends, but buffered by defense spending. Yet two major problems could arise from a Trump presidency.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirstly, Congress might want to increase funding for Ukraine, but Trump can veto the bills. Pair this with Republican lawmakers who have been more skeptical of foreign aid compared to Democrats, and RTX could lose big. That\u2019s because a spending cut in Ukraine could impact RTX\u2019s bottom line, as they recently secured a $282 million contract to supply air defense systems to the country.\n\nSecondly, a potential re-election of Donald Trump could pose a challenge. Trump has publicly advocated for ending the wars in Israel and Ukraine. This stance could threaten RTX\u2019s $1.7 billion program to provide Patriot missiles to both NATO and Israel. Thus, it\u2019s clear that a change in government policy could cut deep into RTX\u2019s booked revenues and impact future performance.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite being the biggest name in the modern aerospace industry, Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE:LMT) outlook after the 2024 election could decrease significantly. Despite its recent contract wins in the satellite sector, its contracts to supply Javelin missiles and F-35s could be at risk of cuts to NATO funding and military acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Trump has widely advocated for spending cuts on the grossly overbudget F-35 program. In fact, seven years ago, the former president tweeted how billions of dollars need to be saved on out-of-control programs like the F-35. This slashed LMT\u2019s stock value by $4 billion in the days following his tweet.\n\nThis kind of rhetoric from Trump helps underscore his commitment to better managing taxpayer money, which in turn means less financial flexibility for contractors like LMT. Thus, should the former president return to office, he could enact sweeping measures to reign in government spending on the admittedly over-engineered fighter jet.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the primary producer of the M1 Abrams tank, which recently saw action in Ukraine, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) stands to lose a significant source of revenue potential in the event of peace in Eastern Europe. Considering that Trump openly intends to end this war, the potential resupply revenue that would come from expended tanks and other military materials produced by General Dynamics could come to a quick close.\n\nMoreover, while the company is very broadly diversified across several different defense sectors from aviation to maritime to ground systems, the Trump administration may curtail some spending on the programs that General Dynamics relies on beyond the M1 tank program.\n\nAs a result, investors may want to consider taking profits on General Dynamics\u2019 strong run over the last few years before it corrects in the face of a more conservative administration on the side of foreign policy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "title": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 23, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $17.06 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?\n\nFor Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.59%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $5.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.33, delivering a surprise of +9.14%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nLockheed appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nTextron (TXT), another stock in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +2.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.54 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Textron has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.29%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Lockheed Martin (LMT) Outperforming Other Aerospace Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "For those looking to find strong Aerospace stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Lockheed Martin (LMT) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nLockheed Martin is one of 46 individual stocks in the Aerospace sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #2 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Lockheed Martin is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nWithin the past quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT's full-year earnings has moved 0.2% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.\n\nBased on the latest available data, LMT has gained about 2.4% so far this year. In comparison, Aerospace companies have returned an average of -4.3%. This shows that Lockheed Martin is outperforming its peers so far this year.\n\nAnother stock in the Aerospace sector, TransDigm Group (TDG), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 22.8%.\n\nIn TransDigm Group's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 3.7% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nBreaking things down more, Lockheed Martin is a member of the Aerospace - Defense industry, which includes 22 individual companies and currently sits at #71 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, this group has lost an average of 9.8% so far this year, meaning that LMT is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nTransDigm Group, however, belongs to the Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry. Currently, this 23-stock industry is ranked #30. The industry has moved +14.2% so far this year.\n\nGoing forward, investors interested in Aerospace stocks should continue to pay close attention to Lockheed Martin and TransDigm Group as they could maintain their solid performance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT): One of the Best Dividend Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Stocks For Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2023, dividend stocks underperformed compared to the overall market, which was driven largely by tech stocks. As we move into the latter half of 2024, dividend stocks have shown a similar performance trend in the first half of the year. The Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, is down by 0.17% year-to-date, compared with a nearly 18% gain in the broader market. Dividend stocks are declining for two main reasons. First, high interest rates are drawing investors towards bonds instead. Second, the current surge in AI technology is capturing investors' focus on tech stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has achieved its all-time high this year, surging by over 25% so far in 2024. That said, investors haven't completely lost faith in dividend stocks. When all is said and done, successful investing is about playing the long game. Dividend stocks have consistently delivered, accounting for 36% of the market's total return since 1927. Bank of America has also declared 2024 as \u2018the year of dividends\u2019.\n\nIn dividend investing, dividend growth stocks often take a lead over high-yield dividend stocks. Recent research indicates that companies providing consistent and sustainable dividends, without excessive payouts, have delivered the best long-term returns. Wellington Management conducted a study that categorized dividend-paying companies into five groups based on their payout levels. Since 1930, the research found that stocks with the highest dividend payouts generally performed similarly to those with high, but not the very highest, payouts, although they frequently traded places as the top performers over the decades.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nThe dividend growth strategy has become so prominent over the years that many companies in the US are steadily increasing their payouts. In 2023, dividend payments reached an all-time high and have consistently increased over the years. Analysts are very optimistic about dividend payments for 2024, and recent projections indicate that the companies are on course to meet this new target record. One of the key reasons for this growth is that many companies, especially large technology firms, have abundant cash reserves and are rapidly increasing their free cash flows. This strong financial position enables them to continue rewarding their investors with higher dividend payments. According to the latest report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, companies in the index paid $153.4 billion in dividends in the second quarter of 2024, up from $151.6 billion from the previous quarter and up from $143.2 billion in the same period last year. The report also mentioned that there were 539 reported dividend increases, compared to 460 in the prior-year period, marking a 17.2% year-over-year rise. The total amount of these dividend increases reached $20.4 billion for the quarter, up from $9.8 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend growth stocks are a hit with investors because they have rock-solid businesses, a steady cash flow, and strong balance sheets. These companies are top-notch for generating passive income. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources such as Forbes, Morningstar, Barron\u2019s, and Business Insider. From their latest articles, we gathered the stocks they collectively favored. Additionally, we assessed the sentiment of hedge funds for each stock using Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in these companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). 5 Countries with the Most Special-Mission Aircraft in the World\n\nA military aircraft in flight, showing the strength of the company's combat & air mobility capability.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Maryland-based aerospace and defense company that specializes in advanced technology systems, services, and products. The company has been catching investors' eye due to an increasing backlog, enhancements in manufacturing, and rising military expenditures. Its backlog is currently at $159 billion, representing over two years of sales. The backlog includes several National Security Space awards received during the first quarter of 2024, highlighting the extensive range of its portfolio. That said, with the federal government making up 75% of the company's annual sales, any changes in defense spending can significantly affect the company's performance. However, we think that the company is well-positioned for growth, thanks to its major programs and advancements in aviation and missile technology.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported growth in all segments. The Aeronautics business generated the highest revenue among all segments, exceeding $6.8 billion, up from $6.3 billion in the same period last year. Overall, the company's revenue came in at $17.2 billion, up 14% from the prior-year period. Its success is largely due to its hefty investments in research and development (R&D) and capital projects. Since the beginning of 2024, it has already unveiled a slew of new initiatives. In the most recent quarter, the company invested over $700 million in R&D, which shows that it has strong cash flow generation. It generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and $1.3 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.\n\nOn June 28, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) declared a quarterly dividend of $3.15 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. It is one of the best stocks for dividends on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 21 consecutive years. In Q1 2024, it returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As of July 15, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.70%.\n\nAt the end of Q1 2024, 47 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), down from 58 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is nearly $1.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, Two Sigma Advisors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.\n\nOverall LMT ranks 15th on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy. You can visit 15 Best Stocks For Dividends to see the other dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of LMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than LMT but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Aerospace Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill.

It is expected to reach a $1.1 trillion evaluation by 2030 growing at an 8.9% CAGR. Government subsidization of space exploration initiatives, as well as private funding, are factors making this growth rate possible. Additionally, increased demand for satellites for telecommunication and meteorological purposes will further drive the space economy market in the future.\n\nWith space being one of the key markets in the future, make sure you don\u2019t miss out on these space stocks to buy now\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a leader within the multinational defense and aerospace industry. Yahoo! Finance reports 22 analysts predicting a one-year price range on LMT between $354.34 and $504.50, with an average of $450.57.\n\nFinancials for LMT aren\u2019t looking too strong for Q1 2024.

While the topline has grown, this can be seen in affecting the company\u2019s bottom line with net income down 8.53% YOY. However, a silver lining is that management is improving with regards to responsibilities. Cash from financing has increased 106.02% and free cash flow has grown 0.2% YOY, showing that management is improving profitability through their actions to some extent.\n\nSurprisingly, Lockheed Martin shows promise in its future. The company has landed a $4.6 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its objective is to develop ML training methods, training AI agents to make informed decisions by considering simultaneous factors in beyond visual range (BVR) aerial missions. A favorable result from this partnership, could gain bigger contracts for LMT from DARPA or similar organizations. With a partnership that paints a positive outlook for LMT, it\u2019s one of the space stocks to buy now.\n\nKratos Defense and Security (KTOS) The front of a Kratos (KTOS) office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nKratos Defense and Security (NASDAQ:KTOS) is a technology company that specializes in military electronics, but also works on satellite communication technologies.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Wins Contract to Support F-35 Jet Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Aeronautics, recently secured a modification contract involving its F-35 fighter jet program. The contract is expected to be completed by January 2029.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $70.1 million, the award has been offered by the???Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. The latest modification requires Lockheed to provide a redesign for the synchronous dynamic random-access memory to support the F-35 aircraft diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages. The random-access memory will be used in Technical Refresh\n\nThree integrated core processors and panoramic cockpit displays of F-35 jets.\u00a0\r\nWork related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nRapidly increasing security threats across different regions of the world, like the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as the long-going unrest in varied parts of the Middle East, have prompted nations to modernize their defense arsenal significantly in recent times. As aerial security constitutes a critical part of a nation\u2019s defense structure, an increased investment trend in technologically advanced fighter jets, which come with enhanced stealth capabilities, like F-35 jets, is being witnessed lately.\n\nIt is imperative to mention in this context that Lockheed\u2019s F-35 program is the most lethal fighter jet, which delivers 5th generation for mission readiness. Equipped with advanced sensors and communications suites, it can serve across every domain, including air, land, sea, space and cyber.\n\nSuch remarkable features must have been boosting the demand for this jet, which, can be further gauged from the fact that Lockheed has delivered 992 F-35 airplanes as of Mar 31, 2024, since its inception. The latest contract win bears yet another testament to the solid demand that the F-35 jets enjoy in the combat jet market.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAs nations across the globe seek to strengthen their aerial defense capabilities, factors like aging fighter jet fleets, innovation of modern fighter aircraft that offer improved speed, agility, and payload capacity than their predecessors, and frequent cross-border conflicts have been boosting the demand for new-age fighter jets. This might have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to project that the global military aviation market will witness a CAGR of 5.2% during 2024-2030.\n\nSuch projections indicate immense growth opportunities for prominent combat jet manufacturers like Lockheed. The company has been designing and manufacturing some of the finest military aircraft for more than a century now. LMT\u2019s fighter jet portfolio includes C-130 Super Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-21, F-22 Raptor and a few more combat aircraft, in addition to F-35 jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nLMT apart, a few defense players that are expected to gain from the expanding military aviation market are mentioned below:\n\nAirbus EADSY: Its military aircraft consists of an A400M airlifter, a C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. In addition to manufacturing these combat jets, Airbus has been providing its customers with an extended portfolio of services, ranging from the training of Flight and Ground Crews up to live firing exercises anywhere around the world, for more than 40 years.\n\nEADSY boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 13.9%.

        "title": "5 High ROE Stocks to Buy as Low Inflation Fuels Rate Cut Hopes",
        "content": "The broader U.S. equity markets witnessed a steady uptrend over the past few trading days, buoyed by optimism related to rate cuts driven by easing inflationary pressures. The June consumer price index declined for the first time in more than four years by 0.1% from May, putting the 12-month rate at 3% \u2013 the lowest level in more than three years.\r\n\r\nThese ignited hopes of a possible rate cut as early as September. The optimism was further propelled by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s latest views that keeping interest rates elevated for too long could risk economic growth. The subtle hint of a less-restrictive stance probably aided the uptrend. A healthy quarterly earnings performance from hitherto reported companies added to the stock market euphoria.\r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \u201cbacking and filling\u201d in the market, they can benefit from \u201ccash cow\u201d stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. United Therapeutics Corporation UTHR, ABB Ltd ABBNY, Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT, MPLX LP MPLX and Banco de Chile BCH are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nROE: A Key Metric\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management\u2019s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.\r\n\r\nReturn on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.\r\n\r\n5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nUnited Therapeutics: Silver Spring, MD-based United Therapeutics markets four medicines in the United States to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension: Remodulin, an injectable formulation of treprostinil, Orenitram, an oral version of treprostinil, Tyvaso, an inhaled version of treprostinil, and Adcirca (tadalafil; also sold by Eli Lilly as Cialis for erectile dysfunction) tablets. The company is also focused on research and development efforts to address the shortage of transplantable organs and tissues through regenerative medicine and organ manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.2% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.4%, on average. It has a VGM Score of A. United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nABB: Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, ABB offers electrification, motion and automation products and solutions for diverse customers in utilities, transport and infrastructure sectors across the globe. The company\u2019s solutions leverage engineering know-how and software to optimize operations and accelerate industrial transformation.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.9%. ABB carries a Zacks Rank #2. \r\n\r\nLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. Its main areas of focus are defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. Lockheed Martin currently operates through four businesses \u2014 Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Missions Systems and Space Systems. \r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 4.1% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.1%, on average. It has a VGM Score of A.\u00a0 Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nMPLX: Findlay, OH-based MPLX LP is a master limited partnership engaged in providing a wide range of midstream energy services, including fuel distribution solutions. The large-cap partnership was created in 2012 to own, operate and develop midstream energy infrastructures and logistics assets, mostly for its parent company, Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Notably, Marathon Petroleum holds around 64% of MPLX's outstanding common units.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.6%, on average.

        "title": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 Results: Benchmarking Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)",
        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 Results: Benchmarking Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the defense contractors industry, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending.

Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 13 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and defense contractors stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nCACI (NYSE:CACI)\n\nFounded to commercialize SIMSCRIPT, CACI International (NYSE:CACI) offers defense, intelligence, and IT solutions to support national security and government transformation efforts.\n\nCACI reported revenues of $1.94 billion, up 11.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 4.4%. Overall, it was a very good\u00a0quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' backlog sales estimates and full-year revenue guidance exceeding analysts' expectations.\n\n\u201cCACI\u2019s outstanding performance reflects the continued successful execution of our strategy. We\u2019re winning and delivering in the marketplace with differentiated capabilities, exceptional business development, and program execution,\u201d said John Mengucci, CACI President and Chief Executive Officer.

        "title": "Is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) Trading At A 28% Discount?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Lockheed Martin fair value estimate is US$646 Lockheed Martin is estimated to be 28% undervalued based on current share price of US$464 Our fair value estimate is 31% higher than Lockheed Martin's analyst price target of US$492\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.16b US$6.46b US$7.02b US$7.03b US$7.08b US$7.17b US$7.29b US$7.42b US$7.57b US$7.73b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 0.81% Est @ 1.28% Est @ 1.61% Est @ 1.84% Est @ 2.00% Est @ 2.12% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4%  US$5.8k US$5.7k US$5.8k US$5.5k US$5.2k US$4.9k US$4.7k US$4.5k US$4.3k US$4.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$51b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (6.4%\u2013 2.4%) = US$195b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$195b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$104b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$155b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$464, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.883. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business unit, Sikorsky, recently clinched a contract for UH-60M helicopter. The award has been provided by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $251.5 million, the project is expected to be completed by Jun 30, 2027. Work related to this deal will be executed in Stratford, CT.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nRising geopolitical conflicts across the globe have prompted nations to significantly enhance investments in strengthening their defense capabilities. Aerial security is one of the pillars of a country\u2019s defense structure, and combat helicopters play a critical role in bolstering airborne safety.\n\nTherefore, with nations boosting their defensive abilities, demand for technologically advanced combat helicopters is rising. This trend has been benefiting prominent defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, a well-known name in military helicopter manufacturing.\n\nNotably, LMT\u2019s UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters are used for multiple purposes ranging from delivering and extracting troops, saving lives as a MEDEVAC or casualty evacuation platform, providing critical supplies to troops, delivering emergency supplies during natural disasters, to performing as an aerial firefighter and border patroller.\n\nConsequently, this multirole helicopter serves the U.S. military and the armed forces of 34 other countries worldwide. Its solid demand can be further gauged from the fact that over 4,000 Black Hawk helicopters of all types are in service worldwide today.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for LMT?\n\nOngoing military modernization initiatives undertaken by varied nations to procure more advanced helicopters to protect their borders from rising cross-border disputes and territorial invasions, along with the evolving nature of modern warfare bolstering the need for more technologically advanced rotorcraft, have been boosting the growth prospects of combat helicopter market.\n\nThis must have led Morder Intelligence to project that the global military helicopter market will witness a CAGR of 2.9% during the 2024-2029 time period.\n\nSuch projections further indicate immense growth opportunities for Lockheed Martin. Apart from UH-60M, Lockheed\u2019s Sikorsky unit manufactures CH-148 Cyclone, CH-53K, RAIDER X, HH-60W, MH-60R Seahawk and a few more combat rotorcraft, which enjoy consistent demand in the military helicopter market.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nOther notable defense contractors that have a significant presence in the global military helicopter market and are expected to gain from this market\u2019s growth are mentioned below:\n\nStory continues\n\nTextron TXT: Its Bell segment supplies advanced military helicopters as well as parts and support services to the U.S. Government and other U.S. allies.

        "content": "RTX Corporation\u2019s RTX business segment, Raytheon, recently won a $1.2 billion contract for delivering its Patriot air and missile defense systems to Germany. The successful delivery of the aforementioned missile system should improve revenue growth for RTX in the future years.\r\n\r\nPer the terms of the agreement, RTX will offer the most current Patriot Configuration 3+ radars, launchers, command and control stations, associated spares and support to the German government.\n\nSignificance of the Patriot System\n\nPatriot is a long-range, high-altitude, all-weather missile defense system intended to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and sophisticated fighter aircraft. The Patriot system is made up of radars, command-and-control technologies and a variety of interceptors.\r\n\r\nThe robust demand for Patriots in the missile defense sector is demonstrated by the fact that 240 Patriot fire units have been delivered to date and that 19 nations are currently using PATRIOT for their integrated air and missile defense.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nIn the wake of the global upsurge in geopolitical tensions, countries have been bolstering their military capabilities on several fronts in recent years. Rapid technical advancements have made missile defense an increasingly important component of a country's military policy. RTX, being a well-known missile manufacturer, has been witnessing a solid flow of orders for its combat-proven missiles, backed by the growing use of missile defense by countries worldwide. The aforementioned contract award is a prime illustration of that.\r\n\r\nOf late, hostile activities like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing unrest in the Middle East have been bolstering the demand scenario in the missile market even more. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm predicts the global market for missiles and missile defense systems to witness a CAGR of 5% between 2024 and 2029. This should benefit RTX, which has a handful of combat-proven missiles in its product portfolio, like the TOW missile, Guidance Enhanced Missile, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 and a few more, in addition to the Patriot missile.\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nAs global threats rise, apart from RTX, military contractors that are projected to gain from the growth prospects presented by the missiles and missile defense system industry are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\r\n\r\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: Its Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat, missile, rocket, manned and unmanned systems for military customers. Some of its renowned products are the PAC-3 family of missiles, M270, RRPR, THHAD and a few more.\r\n\r\nLockheed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales implies growth of 3.2% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics GD: Its Mission Systems unit has designed, produced, installed and sustained every version of the Weapon Control System (Fire Control) for Polaris, Poseidon, Trident I and Trident II Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles. The company has been recently selected to perform the intercontinental ballistic missile Concept Design and Architecture-Guidance study.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics\u2019 long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GD\u2019s 2024 sales calls for growth of 10.5% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past six months, shares of RTX Corp. have risen 17.8% against the industry\u2019s decline of 6.8%.

        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Lockheed Martin (LMT) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $6.60 a share 11 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 23, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $6.60 Most Accurate Estimate and the $6.44 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of 2.59%.\n\nLMT is part of a big group of Aerospace stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Northrop Grumman (NOC) as well.\n\nNorthrop Grumman, which is readying to report earnings on July 25, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $6.03 a share, and NOC is 13 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman is $5.98, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.86%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LMT and NOC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed the latest trading day at $460.38, indicating a -0.14% change from the previous session's end. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.88%.

For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $7.26 per share and it actually produced earnings of $7.90 per share, delivering a surprise of 8.82%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Lockheed. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nLockheed has an Earnings ESP of +2.59% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 23, 2024.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Mercury Systems MRCY announced that it has signed a $13.2 million agreement with the U.S. Navy to advance sensor processing technologies, which will allow radar and electronic warfare capabilities to be reduced by a significant time.\r\n\r\nIncreasing software and system complexity has been extending timelines to develop and launch military platforms for decades. The Office of Naval Research\u2019s Open Rapid Chipletized Approach program is aiming to decrease the time needed to design edge processing solutions. This will be done by increasing the modularity of components at the chip level.\r\n\r\nUnder this agreement, Mercury will develop a next-generation RF System-in-Package (SiP), which will integrate the latest commercial chips from the largest semiconductor provider within a lighter and smaller footprint.\r\n\r\nThis agreement would help MRCY build on the RFS1140 SiP, which integrates Jariet Electra-MA high-speed data converters, AMD Versal field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and Micron memory for a comprehensive solution to support sensor processing.\n\nYear-to-date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMercury\u2019s Other Partnerships to Aid Long-Term Growth Prospects\n\nMercury\u2019s recent agreement with the U.S. Navy came on the heels of some other notable partnerships, which are expected to aid long-term growth prospects for the company. These partnerships include an agreement with BlueHalo, L3Harris and Lockheed Martin.\r\n\r\nMRCY secured a production agreement with BlueHalo to support the U.S. Space Force\u2019s Satellite Communication Augmentation Resource program. The company will provide a FPGA-based common signal acquisition and digital beamforming solution for BlueHalo\u2019s BADGER system.\r\n\r\nMercury also signed a $31 million contract from L3Harris Technologies to provide solid slate data recorders for the U.S. Space Development Agency\u2019s Tranche 2 Tracking Layer satellite constellation. The company\u2019s solid-state data recorders are also the primary storage devices for all three L3Harris constellations.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, MRCY collaborated with Lockheed Martin to advance the defense and manufacturing technologies in Switzerland. This project is a result of a program between Lockheed Martin and the Swiss government as part of Switzerland\u2019s acquisition of the F-35 Lightning II. Under this agreement, Mercury will enable the transfer of two of armasuisses\u2019 key security-relevant technologies\u2013software-defined radio technologies and cryptology\u2013to the Swiss industry.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mercury faces tough competition from Kratos Defense & Security Solutions KTOS, Lockheed Martin LMT and Elbit Systems ESLT in the defense sector.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have plunged 18.4% year to date against the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 29.4%. It also underperformed KTOS and LMT\u2019s rise of 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and ESLT\u2019s decline of 12.1%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nMercury\u2019s recent agreements and partnerships are a major positive. However, competition in the defense industry remains a concern.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company is suffering due to increasing operating expenses and margin pressure.\r\n\r\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 790 basis points to 41.4% from 33.5% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRCY\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 loss per share is pegged at 5 cents, which has widened by a cent in the past 60 days. The consensus mark for fiscal 2024 loss is pegged at 97 cents per share, which has widened by 6 cents in the past 60 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 Earnings: Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) Best of the Bunch\n\nLooking back on defense contractors stocks' Q1 earnings, we examine this quarter's best and worst performers, including Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 13 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the defense contractors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 1.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nBest Q1: Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC)\n\nResponsible for the development of the first stealth bomber, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) specializes in providing aerospace, defense, and security solutions for various industry applications.\n\nNorthrop Grumman reported revenues of $10.13 billion, up 8.9% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 3.8%. Overall, it was a stunning quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.

It was a weak quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings and organic revenue estimates.\n\nMercury Systems had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group.

        "content": "The revival of supersonic travel is on the horizon, with several companies developing aircraft capable of significantly reducing travel time across continents. This innovation could redefine long-haul travel, so investors should keep an eye on next-gen aviation stocks.\n\nThe global market for commercial aircraft next-gen avionics is expanding. These advanced systems include state-of-the-art flight management systems, synthetic vision and improved communication and navigation tools. The market, currently valued at $5.33 billion, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.84% over the next five years\u200b.\n\nNow is a great time for investors to consider adding these next-gen aviation stocks to their portfolios. All of these companies have impressive growth trajectories and are backed by solid order books and cheap valuation ratios. But time may be of the essence for investors, as these next-gen aviation stocks may not stay cheap for long.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding mobile phone with web page of US eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. Archer Aviation Stock Analysis\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft aimed at enhancing urban air mobility. The company has strong potential based on the progress it is making with its Midnight eVTOL aircraft program.\n\nThe company has also made significant strides in the development and testing of Midnight\u2019s critical systems. Passing rigorous testing is crucial for safety of flight readiness and supports Archer\u2019s ongoing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification program.\n\nFinancially, Archer has maintained a strong liquidity position, with over $520 million on hand at the end of Q1 while continuing to invest heavily in the Midnight program. This cash runway gives Archer the resources to continue advancing towards commercialization.\n\nFor investors who want to invest in leading companies, ACHR is one of the next-gen aviation stocks that people should consider closely. It offers a great mix of strong growth potential as well as a cheap valuation at just $4.35 per share at the time of writing.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is heavily involved in developing hypersonic weapons and aircraft. The company recently unveiled the Mako Multi-Mission Hypersonic Missile that is designed for versatility and speed.\n\nLockheed Martin posted sales of $17.2 billion in the first quarter, up 14% compared to Q1 2023. Net earnings were $1.5 billion, or $6.39 per share, compared to $1.7 billion, or $6.61 per share, in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Cash from operations was $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $1.3 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperationally, all four of Lockheed Martin\u2019s business segments grew sales year-over-year (YOY). Aeronautics revenue increased 9% driven by higher F-35 and F-16 volume.\n\nFinancially, Lockheed Martin continued to generate strong cash flow while returning significant cash to shareholders. The company paid $780 million in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of stock in Q1. It also issued $2 billion in new debt and ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash on hand.\n\nLeidos Holdings (LDOS) Leidos (LDOS) logo on the side of an office building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS) is involved in various hypersonic programs for the U.S. Department of Defense. The company recently completed key reviews for the Air Force Research Lab\u2019s (AFRL) hypersonic projects.\n\nLeidos posted revenues of $3.98 billion for the first quarter, up a healthy 7% YOY. All customer segments saw increased demand, especially for managed health services. Profitability was a key highlight in Q1. Net income surged 73% to $283 million, or $2.07 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 42% to a record $490 million, with EBITDA margins expanding significantly from 9.4% to 12.3% YOY.\n\nGiven the strong start to the year, management raised its full-year 2024 guidance across all key metrics. Leidos now expects revenue of $16 billion to $16.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-to-high 11% range, non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $8.40 to $8.80 and operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion for the year. With all these factors considered, LDOS is one of the next-gen aviation stocks for investors to strongly consider right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Defense Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "It is not hyperbole to say we are closer to World War III than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. With the U.S. and its western allies provoking Russia over its invasion of Ukraine by saying they will admit the country into NATO, hostilities could escalate.\n\nSimilarly, war in the Middle East could spread further throughout the region dragging the superpowers into a head-to-head conflict. Furthermore, tensions between the U.S. and China over Taiwan are also heightened.\n\nWith so many hotspots that have erupted around the world in the last four years, it is surprising defense contractors aren\u2019t doing better. Most defense stocks badly lag the S&P 500.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile this is possibly because the market feels this is a period of peak earnings that is keeping investors away or runaway government deficits making the $850 billion defense budget unsustainable, there are several undervalued defense stocks ripe for picking. Let\u2019s look at three of the best options.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nChoosing Boeing (NYSE:BA) as an undervalued defense stock may seem comical considering the woes the aircraft manufacturer has with its commercial aircraft business. Although Boeing\u2019s commercial side is typically its biggest (it represented almost 44% of total revenue in 2023) the plane maker\u2019s defense side accounted for 42% of first-quarter revenue and was up 6% year over year. Commercial operations accounted for just 28% as sales plummeted 31% year-over-year due to its well-publicized issues.\n\nBeyond Air Force One and Two for the U.S. president and vice president, Boeing military aircraft include the C-17 Globemaster III, the B-52 bomber and F/A-18 and F-22 fighter jets.\n\nBoeing stock has bounced 15% off its lows but remains 30% below its 52-week high. It also sits 58% below its all-time high set in 2019. The plane maker, though, recently accepted a $243 million fine for pleading guilty to fraud regarding several plane crashes several years ago. As the fine is de minimis relative to its revenue, if approved, the aircraft stock can move beyond this sorry chapter in its history.\n\nThe company also said it would reacquire its parts manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) for $4.7 billion in a bid to have greater control over its manufacturing.\n\nBut the fact is, Boeing is simply too big to fail. It is one of just two major commercial aircraft manufacturers along with the U.K.\u2019s BAE Systems (OTCMKTS:BAESY). Because Boeing is so critical to U.S. civilian and military aviation, its low point now represents an opportunity to buy an undervalued defense contractor.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed-Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the largest U.S. defense contractor. It generates almost $68 billion annually from government contracts and is responsible for some of the most important military programs.\n\nAmong its priorities are F-16 and F-22 fighter jets, F-35 stealth fighters, the Patriot missile system, Javelin anti-tank weapons systems, Black Hawk helicopters, Trident ballistic missiles and NASA\u2019s Orion spacecraft. Many of these weapons and defense systems are also sold to foreign governments.\n\nIf there is a war anywhere, it is likely you will find Lockheed-Martin aircraft and defense systems at play. First-quarter revenue grew 14% to $17.2 billion with F-35 revenue rising almost 10% to $6.9 billion. Missile system sales were up 25% from last year.\n\nAlthough earnings dropped as questions about its fighter jet contracts rose, Lockheed secured a contract extension last month for the F-35 that should boost operating results.\u00a0It remains a very profitable company that will be integral to the U.S. military for years.\n\nThe defense contractor\u2019s stock trades at 16 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates and 17 times free cash flow. Lockheed pays a dividend yielding 2.8% annually and has raised the payout for 21 consecutive years making it an attractive undervalued defense stock to buy.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world\u2019s largest weapons manufacturers and military technology providers. It is arguably best-known for its flying wing-shaped B-2 stealth bomber. Its B-21 Raider will eventually replace the B-2. Northrop was also the sole bidder for the government\u2019s Ground Based Strategic Deterrent intercontinental ballistic missile system that will replace existing Minuteman missiles.\n\nThe defense contractor\u2019s stock is down 8% over the past year, though first-quarter revenue rose 8% to $10 billion and earnings jumped 15% to $6.32 per share. Northrop also has a shareholder-friendly policy of returning to investors most of the free cash flow it produces through stock buybacks and dividends. That amounted to $1.5 billion in the first quarter.\n\nThe undervalued defense stock has paid a dividend every year since 1990 and has raised the payout consistently since 2004. The dividend currently yields 1.8% annually.\n\nBecause this solid defense player still has a long runway of growth ahead of it, the beaten down share price makes it a buy in July.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "3 Defense Stocks With Strong Dividend Track Records\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMilitary spending is consistently a significant part of the United States budget, and there are no signs of that abating any time soon. In fact, for the 2025 fiscal year, the U.S. Department of Defense has requested $850 billion in defense spending, a number that represents approximately 3% of the U.S. GDP. The vast defense budget is deployed across a wide variety of contractors, many of which are publicly traded. There are a few standouts that have a solid dividend yield and a consistent growth story.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Finance companies are leaving New York for this hot city. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nAn Aristocrat In The Making\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is primarily known as a defense technology company. Its wide portfolio of products features aircraft, including both helicopters and military planes; radar and electronic warfare; submersible vehicles; space technology; and missiles. It frequently receives key contracts from the U.S. Department of Defense, including an over $500 million contract update with the Air Force.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, it achieved net sales of over $17.2 billion. But what might most interest investors is the money it returns to investors. During the quarter, it announced $1.8 billion in share buybacks and dividends, returning $780 million to shareholders in dividends.\n\nLockheed Martin's forward dividend yield is 2.73%. While some companies decreased or paused their dividends during the pandemic, Lockheed continued to grow its dividend at $3.15 or $12.30 annualized. It is in its 24th year of increasing dividends, bringing it very close to dividend aristocrat status. While the stock price has fluctuated, it has risen by nearly 25% over the past five years. Lockheed Martin's $159 billion backlog should keep business steady for years.\n\nTrending: Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with just $100.\n\nA Former Dividend Aristocrat Still Shines\n\nIn 2023, Raytheon rebranded to RTX, bringing together Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon under a single name. Raytheon saw defense sales rise by 7% during the first quarter. Like Lockheed Martin, RTX has a substantial backlog of business, over $202 billion, as demand grows for its technology-driven products. RTX is heavily tied to the U.S. military but receives key contracts from other nations, including a $1.2 billion contract from Germany for radar, launchers, and command and control stations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dividend story is more modest here. RTX delivers a 2.52% forward dividend yield, but the annual dividend is $2.36. However, it was a dividend aristocrat until it decreased its dividend during the 2020 pandemic. While it has yet to achieve the dividend it was delivering before the pandemic, it has raised its dividend consistently over the past four years, and the stock price is up over 20% during the last five years.\n\nBy Land, Sea, And More\n\nFounded in 1952, General Dynamics has multiple business units related to defense, including aerospace, combat systems, and marine systems. Like RTX, its strength expands far beyond the U.S. military. It has contracts with various nations, including Romania, Austria, and Canada, delivering combat vehicles, submarines, and more. Gulfstream Aerospace is also a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics, giving it more than military strength.\n\nDuring its most recent quarter, General Dynamics paid $361 million in dividends. The forward dividend yield is 2.02% and the annual dividend is $5.36. It started paying a dividend in 2012 and has raised that dividend consistently over time. It has a $93.7 billion backlog of business, up 4.4% year over year. The stock price has risen approximately 50% over the past five years.\n\nDefense spending may fluctuate over time, but it is unlikely to disappear from national budgets anytime soon. That is a powerful incentive for companies that have a history of contracts with national militaries to keep innovating, capture more of that money over time, and potentially share profits with investors.\n\nCheck Out Some of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "title": "HII vs. LMT: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?",
        "content": "Investors with an interest in Aerospace - Defense stocks have likely encountered both Huntington Ingalls (HII) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nRight now, Huntington Ingalls is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Lockheed Martin has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HII is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nHII currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.80, while LMT has a forward P/E of 17.53. We also note that HII has a PEG ratio of 2.07. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.32.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for HII is its P/B ratio of 2.31. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, LMT has a P/B of 16.61.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to HII's Value grade of A and LMT's Value grade of C.\n\nHII has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LMT, so it seems like value investors will conclude that HII is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Wins $520M Deal to Aid F-16 Block 70/72 Jet",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Aeronautics, recently secured a modification contract involving its advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft. The award has been offered by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $520.4 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Jun 30, 2028. The latest modification expands the current long lead materials contract to begin production tasks of the Viper Shield electronic warfare suite for the F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft.\n\nWork related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX. This contract will serve the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Slovak Republic and the Taiwan Air Force.\n\nThe latest modification brought the cumulative face value of the contract to $897.4 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nAs countries around the world are investing more in modernizing their air combat fleets, the need for reliable, multi-role fighter aircraft has become paramount. With Lockheed enjoying a dominant position in the combat aircraft market, supported by its extensive product portfolio, including the F-35 Lightning II, C-130 Hercules and F-22 Raptor, apart from F-16 jets, it enjoys frequent order flows from the U.S. Air Force as well as other international partners. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nNotably, Lockheed\u2019s F-16 Block 70/72 is the most advanced 4th generation fighter ever built, which comes with next-generation capabilities like high-resolution Center Pedestal Display (\u201cCPD\u201d) and Northrop Grumman\u2019s NOC 5th generation APG-83 AESA radar. Moreover, L3Harris\u2019 Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare (EW) suite has been custom-designed to be integrated into the F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft. Impressively, the F-16 Viper modification offers a scalable, advanced avionics upgrade to F-16 jets.\n\nSuch state-of-the-art features of the F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft must have been boosting the demand for this jet, which, in turn, has been ushering in solid order flows for the company like the latest one. This product\u2019s robust demand can be further gauged from the fact that the backlog of the F-16 Block 70 program, as of March 2024, consisted of 133 aircraft for six countries.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for LMT?\n\nFactors like increased defense budgets and the need for technologically advanced, agile fighter jets to ensure a nation's air superiority and national security to tackle widespread cross-border conflicts are fueling the growth of the fighter aircraft market. In this regard, the Morder Intelligence firm projects the global fighter aircraft market to witness a CAGR of 3.7% during 2024-2029.\r\nSuch growth opportunities can be expected to translate into more contract wins for Lockheed, which is a renowned combat jet manufacturer. Its Aeronautics unit is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, LMT\u2019s Advanced Development Programs (\u201cADP\u201d) organization, also known as Skunk Works, is focused on future systems, including unmanned and manned aerial systems and next-generation capabilities for air dominance, hypersonics, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, situational awareness and air mobility.\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nA few other defense players that are expected to gain from the expanding fighter aircraft market are mentioned below:\n\nTextron TXT: Its Textron Aviation unit is engaged in the production of fighter aircraft like the Beechcraft T-6 training aircraft and the Beechcraft AT-6 light-attack aircraft. The company also manufactures the Beechcraft Model 18 light bomber, the T-44 and T-34 training aircraft and the T-1A jet trainer.\n\nTXT boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 5.7% from that reported in 2023.\n\nBoeing BA: Its Defense, Space & Security segment is engaged in the development, production and modification of a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more. In 2023, Boeing delivered 22 F/A-18s, nine F-15s, three T-7A Red Hawks and 11 P-8 models.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. It has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 17.83%.\n\nNorthrop Grumman: It has built some of the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. The significant awards won by NOC in 2023 included $2.1 billion for F-35 programs, $1.7 billion for E-2 and $1.5 billion for Triton.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from that reported in 2023.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of LMT have risen 1.5% against the industry\u2019s 11.5% decline.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems (\u201cRMS\u201d), recently clinched a modification contract for providing engineering design, development and production support to the U.S. Navy. The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nValued at $199.6 million, the contract is projected to be completed by September 2025. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Manassas, VA.\n\nLockheed\u2019s Maritime Solutions\n\nNations across the globe are fortifying their defense spending on military weapons and arsenals as they look to strengthen their defense capabilities. Against this backdrop, as countries worldwide are enhancing their sea warfare capabilities, an augmented investment in manufacturing navy combat vehicles as well as constantly upgrading them is being noticed in recent times.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed remains one of the primary suppliers of maritime solutions, training and sustainment for the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn particular, its Aegis is a world-renowned naval combat system, which operates as a total weapon system, from detection to kill. The fact that the Aegis weapons system is currently deployed on more than 100 ships across eight ship classes and six navies indicates the solid demand that it enjoys in the global naval combat systems market.\n\nAegis apart, other notable programs designed by LMT\u2019s RMS unit that support the naval missions of the U.S. Navy and international customers are the Littoral Combat Ship (\u201cLCS\u201d) and the Multi-Mission Surface Combatant. This unit also has the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) program, which offers undersea combat systems programs to the U.S. Navy.\n\nSuch capabilities of Lockheed to serve the U.S. Navy with precision sea-based weapons must have enabled it to secure solid order inflows like the latest one.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAs navies around the world are trying to strengthen their defense systems to meet national security goals, the growth prospects for the naval combat system market remain solid. In this regard, according to a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global naval combat system market is projected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2024-2029 period.\n\nThis is likely to benefit Lockheed, considering its maritime capabilities that enable current and future maritime missions. Notably, to ensure the U.S. Navy\u2019s dominance in the sea, LMT provides a broad portfolio of capabilities, including ships, aircraft, manned and unmanned systems, projectiles and sensors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutside the United States, Lockheed\u2019s maritime solutions also aim at strengthening the sea warfare capabilities of U.S. allies as well as other international customers, thereby enhancing its global reach in the naval combat systems space. Evidently, Lockheed offers its SEA 4000 Air Warfare Destroyer (\u201cAWD\u201d) program to upgrade Australia's maritime defense capability. Under this program, the HOBART Class AWDs have been the most advanced and complex warships ever built in Australia.\n\nLMT apart, other defense contractors that are likely to gain from the solid growth opportunities offered by the global naval combat systems market are mentioned below:\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. HII: Its Ingalls Shipbuilding and Newport News Shipbuilding segments design and construct non-nuclear ships, including amphibious assault ships, expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants and national security cutters. During 2023, 81% of the company\u2019s revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy.\n\nHII boasts a long-term (three-to-five-years) earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 2% from the prior-year figure.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corp. NOC: It delivers components like Airborne LASER Mine Detection System, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block III, Fire Scout and bridge and navigation systems for both the Freedom and Independence variants of LCS. During 2023, 15% of NOC\u2019s sales belonged to the Navy.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 4.6% from the prior-year figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. GD: It is the lead integrator for the Independence-variant LCS. GD is responsible for the design, integration and testing of the navigation, command, control, computing and aviation systems on each ship. In 2023, the Marins Systems business segment generated 23% of the company\u2019s total revenues.\n\nGD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 10.5% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of LMT have rallied 3.1% against the industry\u2019s 10.2% decline.

        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 In Review: General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) Vs Peers\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q1 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 14 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.2%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the defense contractors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 1.6% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD)\n\nCreator of the famous M1 Abrahms tank, General Dynamics (NYSE:GS) develops aerospace, marine systems, combat systems, and information technology products.\n\nGeneral Dynamics reported revenues of $10.73 billion, up 8.6% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 4.2%. It was a mixed quarter for the company.\u00a0General Dynamics blew past analysts' revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its backlog fell short Wall Street's estimates. General Dynamics Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 4.2% since the results and currently trades at $280.47.\n\nRead our full report on General Dynamics here, it's free.\n\nBest Q1: Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC)\n\nResponsible for the development of the first stealth bomber, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) specializes in providing aerospace, defense, and security solutions for various industry applications.\n\nNorthrop Grumman reported revenues of $10.13 billion, up 8.9% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 3.8%. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues Northrop Grumman Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 8.1% since the results and currently trades at $436.\n\nIs now the time to buy Northrop Grumman?

It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' earnings and organic revenue estimates.\n\nMercury Systems had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The stock is up 2.5% since the results and currently trades at $29.82.\n\nRead our full analysis of Mercury Systems's results here.\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)\n\nResponsible for renowned military systems like the F-35 fighter jet, Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) specializes in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology solutions.\n\nLockheed Martin reported revenues of $17.2 billion, up 13.7% year on year, surpassing analysts' expectations by 7.5%.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned -1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share, indicating a change of -4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $17.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2%. The $69.72 billion and $72.44 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Wins $227M Deal for Army Tactical Missile System",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a contract to procure Army Tactical Missile System (\u201cATACMS\u201d) guided missile and launching assembly. The Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL, has provided the award.\n\nValued at $226.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec 30, 2028. Work related to this deal will be executed in Grand Prairie, TX.\n\nThe contract will serve the governments of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco and Poland.\n\nRising Missile Demand & Lockheed\n\nRapidly increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide, along with heightened regional conflicts in different parts of the globe, like the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the South China Sea over the last decade, have prompted nations to bolster their defense capabilities.\u00a0 Since missiles constitute a large share of a nation\u2019s defense arsenals, countries are investing heftily these days in advanced missile systems for deterrence and defense. This, in turn, has been boosting the demand for technologically advanced missile systems.\n\nWhen it comes to purchase of missiles, Lockheed remains one of the top choices as a missile manufacturer. Notably, the company\u2019s broad portfolio of missile products includes air-to-air missiles to give pilots air supremacy; helicopter-launched anti-armor missiles to destroy enemy tanks and other armored vehicles; man-portable short-range anti-armor and assault weapons; and kinetic energy hyper-velocity missiles.\u00a0 These can defeat all current and future armored threats as well as hit-to-kill air defense systems that protect the troops from ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, enemy aircraft and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn particular, LMT\u2019s ATACMS is a conventional surface-to-surface artillery weapon system capable of striking targets well beyond the range of existing Army cannons, rockets and other missiles. It comes with an improved guidance package with Global Positioning System (\u201cGPS\u201d) and offers a maximum range of 300 kilometers. These features must have been boosting the demand for ATACMS, the latest contract win being a bright example of that.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nWith the ongoing hostilities across the globe, the global peace index indicates an unstable environment. As a result, the demand for military weapons \u2014 especially missiles \u2014 has increased in the defense industry as nations attempt to defend their borders from previously unheard-of attacks.\n\nThis must have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to project that the global missiles and missiles defense system market will witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Lockheed, which is a prominent missile manufacturer.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts major missile programs include the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (\u201cTHAAD\u201d) air and missile defense programs, Multiple Launch Rocket System (\u201cMLRS\u201d), Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (\u201cJASSM\u201d), Long Range AntiShip Missile (\u201cLRASM\u201d), the Hellfire tactical and strike missile programs and the Javelin program, which is an anti-tank precision weapon system.\n\nLMT apart, defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missiles and missile defense system market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\n\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp RTX: It offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, Evolved Seasparrow Missiles, the Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground with a $115 million worth, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: For almost 25 years, Boeing has been providing the United States, its allies and international partners with air and missile defense systems. The Avenger Air Defense System, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and a few additional missiles are among its product offerings.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The stock holds an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.83%.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Lockheed have risen 3.2% against the industry\u2019s decline of 10%.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Insiders Sold US$9.4m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy",
        "content": "In the last year, many Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$2.8m worth of shares at a price of US$428 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$466. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.\n\nIn total, Lockheed Martin insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Lockheed Martin better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.06% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$64m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Lockheed Martin Insiders?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Lockheed Martin shares in the last quarter. Still, the insider transactions at Lockheed Martin in the last 12 months are not very heartening. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "An investor is unlikely to beat inflation by simply holding funds in a bank account. In such a scenario, there will be continued loss of purchasing power due to inflation increasing faster than average interest rates. Therefore, there needs to be diversification across asset classes. Within equities, quality growth stocks can provide robust returns. However, investors need to balance between growth and blue-chip stocks to lower the portfolio beta.\n\nBlue-chip stocks might not deliver 10x or 20x returns in five years like some growth stocks. However, there are blue-chip ideas that can generate returns that consistently beats the rate of inflation. I am talking about total returns that includes the dividend yield and capital gains.\n\nThe focus of this column is on seven fundamentally strong blue-chip names with high cash flow potential. Further, these stocks seem attractively valued and the upside potential is meaningful from current levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense sector spending has been inching higher as geopolitical tensions rise. However, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock has remained subdued amidst positive industry tailwinds. LMT stock is attractive at a forward P/E of 17.8x and offers a dividend yield of 2.7%. I expect a breakout on the upside as the company\u2019s backlog swells and translates into accelerated growth.\n\nAs of March, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $159 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For 2024, the defense major has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion. Healthy cash flows will ensure value creation through dividends and share repurchase.\n\nI further believe that the order intake will remain robust in the coming years. One reason is that Lockheed is investing in next-generation defense technology. This includes next-generation interceptor, hypersonic and advanced microelectronics, among others.\n\nAnother potential growth driver for the company is expanding international collaborations. Lockheed is working with 50 countries globally. I expect international revenue to increase as a percent of total revenue in the coming years.\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX) CVX stock\n\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrude oil is gradually trending higher on expectations of expansionary monetary policies. It\u2019s therefore a good time to consider oil & gas exploration blue-chip stocks. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has remained sideways in the last 12 months and looks attractively valued. Besides the potential for capital gains, CVX stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 4.17%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first reason to be bullish on Chevron is an investment grade balance sheet. This provides the oil & gas major with ample flexibility to make aggressive investments.\n\nThe second reason to be bullish is low break-even oil assets. This translates into robust operating and free cash flows even if oil is around $80 per barrel. To put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $35.6 billion in 2023.\n\nWith a potential upside in oil, acquisition of Hess Corporation, and organic production growth, it\u2019s likely that OCF will swell significantly. This will provide ample flexibility for dividend growth and share repurchase. At the same time, organic capex is expected to sustain above $15 billion annually.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nGold is another asset class that\u2019s likely to witness a sustained bull-run. The precious metal seems to be in a zone of consolidation above $2,300 an ounce. With potential rate cuts, it\u2019s likely that gold will zoom past $2,500 an ounce. This will translate into a meaningful rally for gold mining stocks.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is among the best miners to consider and looks undervalued at a forward P/E of 15.3x. Further, NEM stock offers a dividend yield of 2.4% and I expect healthy dividend growth if gold remains in an uptrend.\n\nAn obvious reason to like Newmont is high-quality assets. The gold miner has a portfolio of ten tier one assets. As of 2023, the total gold reserves and resources were 128 and 155 million ounces respectively. This provides profitable growth visibility beyond the current decade considering an attractive all-in-sustaining cost.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Newmont reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion in 2023. With higher realized gold price and the impact of the acquisition of Newcrest Mining, it\u2019s likely that the EBITDA will be more than $5 billion. As cash flows swell, NEM stock is likely to surge.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not often that blue-chip stocks trade at a valuation gap. However, when sentiments are overly bearish, it\u2019s the best time to buy. This holds true for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). After a correction of 23% in the last 12 months, the consumer discretionary stock seems to have bottomed out.\n\nThe downside is capped and the upside potential is significant. To put things into perspective, the most bearish analyst price target for the next 12 months is $77. SBUX stock currently trades marginally below these levels. On the optimistic side, the price target is $112, which would imply an upside potential of 46%. I must add that the stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.96%.\n\nOf course, Starbucks reported global comparable store sales decline of 4% for Q2 2024. Revenue also declined by 2% on a year-on-year basis to $8.6 billion. However, the negatives are discounted in the price and the business continues to deliver robust cash flows. Further, the management remains optimistic on the long-term outlook and with ample scope for growth in new markets, the correction is a buying opportunity.\n\nAltria (MO) a sign with the Altria (MO) logo\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) stock is among the most depressed blue-chip names. The stock has witnessed time correction in the last five years. However, it\u2019s worth noting that MO stock offers a robust dividend yield of 8.52%. Further, I believe that the next five years are likely to be different and the undervalued tobacco company will deliver healthy returns.\n\nAn important point to note is that as the company undertakes business transformation, growth has been subdued. However, the smokable business segment remains the cash cow and will ensure steady dividends. At the same time, the smokable business provides cash flows for aggressive investment in the non-smokable category.\n\nIn an important business development, NJOY received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorization for its menthol e-vapor products. NJOY already has a distribution network of over 80,000 stores. With the only menthol e-vapor product authorized by the FDA, the growth potential is significant. It\u2019s also worth noting that Altria has been gaining market share in the oral tobacco category. With these positives, I expect MO stock to trend higher from undervalued levels.\n\nMerck (MRK) A photo of a large concrete Merck & Co Inc (MRK) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong pharmaceutical blue-chip stocks, Merck (NYSE:MRK) looks attractive at a forward P/E of 14.9x. The pharma company also offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.41%. Considering the growth outlook, I believe that MRK stock will be a long-term value creator.\n\nThe first point to note is that Merck has an attractive late-stage clinical development program. Currently, 80 programs are in the second phase and 30 in the third phase.\n\nA deep pipeline provides revenue growth visibility with the prospects of multiple new drugs being commercialized. To put things into perspective, Merck expects an oncology pipeline opportunity of $20 billion in sales by mid-2035. The vaccine and infectious disease segment will add to the growth momentum.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Merck reported healthy sales growth of 9% on a year-on-year basis to $15.8 billion. Further, non-GAAP EPS increased by 48% on a year-on-year basis. Considering the annual guidance, healthy earnings growth will sustain and MRK stock is likely to remain in an uptrend.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO) the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.com\n\nRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is an undervalued commodity company with the stock trading at a forward P/E of 9x. RIO stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 7.77%. Considering the cash flow potential, dividends are sustainable.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that RIO stock traded sideways in the last 12 months. However, that\u2019s likely to change with potential expansionary policies supporting global GDP growth. It\u2019s therefore a good time to accumulate this industrial commodity blue-chip.\n\nOne concern related to commodity stocks is the cyclical nature of the business. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Rio Tinto has delivered an average annual free cash flow of $10.6 billion in the last five years. The company therefore has strong fundamentals and aggressive investment plans.\n\nOf course, the iron ore business remains the cash flow driver. However, Rio Tinto is increasingly investing in metals that will support global energy transition. This includes copper, aluminium, and lithium, among others. Portfolio diversification is likely to yield positive results in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amidst ongoing conflicts, the choice of defense stocks for investors might seem crucial yet unpredictable due to varying government spending priorities. Though economic upheaval isn\u2019t my primary prediction, several scenarios could disrupt the U.S. economy.\n\nFor example, one concern is the unsustainable national debt, which experts like BlueBay\u2019s Mark Dowling warn could lead to significant financial instability. Additionally, a major conflict in the Middle East could spike oil prices, potentially triggering a recession. There\u2019s also the persistent threat of terrorism, particularly with ongoing global tensions.\n\nDespite economic uncertainties, defense stocks could remain resilient due to consistent demand for U.S. weaponry amid geopolitical challenges. If chosen wisely, these profitable defense stocks can offer defensive stability based on critical product demand rather than heavy government funding reliance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), a key player in aerospace and defense, excelled in Q1 2024 with $10.1B in sales, a 9% year-over-year (YOY) increase. The company leads in satellite manufacturing and space technology, contributing to missions like NASA\u2019s Artemis program.\n\nDespite recent declines, NOC is positioned for growth with new contracts and partnerships, including NATO\u2019s interest in expanding maritime surveillance with Triton aircraft. Analysts foresee potential gains, with NOC trading at 17.7x forward earnings and 1.6x sales, suggesting a 14% upside next year.\n\nIn other NOC news, Northrop Grumman\u2019s XRQ-73, designated for DARPA\u2019s Shepard program, is led by its Aeronautics Systems division in Redondo Beach, CA. Collaborating with Scaled Composites, known for its expertise in aircraft design, the program builds on technology from the earlier Great Horned Owl project. Great Horned Owl, initiated in 2011 by IARPA with support from AFRL, focused on developing a stealthy surveillance drone with advanced series hybrid electric architecture.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilar to Northrop, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) offers stable investment potential in space stocks, focusing on satellite technology amid rising geopolitical tensions. Despite a nearly flat performance in 2024, analysts rate it a Hold with a modest upside.\n\nFinancially, Lockheed reported $6.78 billion in net income over the past year, with revenue reaching $69.64 billion. Expectations for fiscal 2024 foresee earnings at $26.27 per share and revenue climbing to $72.36 billion in 2025, complemented by a 2.7% forward dividend yield, emphasizing stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s advanced weather satellite, built for NOAA, successfully launched from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center via a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Named GOES-U, it deployed its solar array and established communication with operators. GOES-U is the final satellite in NOAA\u2019s GOES-R series, set to be renamed GOES-19 after reaching geostationary orbit. It will serve as GOES East, offering weather imagery, atmospheric data, lightning mapping and space weather observations over North America\u2019s East Coast.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD), known for its diverse operations in aerospace, marine systems, combat systems and technologies, saw a robust financial performance. Revenue climbed to $10.7 billion, up 8.6% YOY, with net earnings reaching $799 million, a 9.5% increase. Diluted EPS grew by 9.1% to $2.88, showcasing strong profitability with gross and operating margins exceeding 15% and 9%, respectively.\n\nIn late March, Gulfstream Aerospace, a division of General Dynamics, achieved FAA-type certification for its new Gulfstream G700, with initial deliveries already underway. Increased demand in Combat Systems and growth in Marine Systems, driven by U.S. Navy contracts, are key drivers.\n\nThe company boasts a 1.97% dividend yield, consistently increased for 33 years. With a low beta of 0.64, indicating less market risk, GD stock shows resilience despite recent peaks. Its robust combat and marine systems sectors and solid order backlog position it well for continued growth, potentially bolstered by margin improvements and Gulfstream business jet sales.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s NOC business segment, Northrop Grumman Systems, recently clinched a contract involving its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. The award has been provided by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $41 million, the contract is projected to be completed by July 2030. Per the terms of the deal, Northrop will procure four E-2D rotodome spares to enhance the E-2D advance capabilities used on the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye jets.\n\nWork related to this deal will be executed in Melbourne, FL.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Northrop?\n\nIn this era of modern warfare, military jets play a crucial role in strengthening a nation\u2019s defense arsenal. Impressively, today\u2019s combat jets boast the capability to serve multiple missions, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground attacks, maritime operations and even nuclear delivery. Therefore, as increasing geopolitical threats are prompting nations across the globe to reinforce their military capabilities, combat aircraft are witnessing a solid demand. This, in turn, has been ushering in frequent order flows for major combat aircraft manufacturers like Northrop. The latest contract win is a testament to that.\n\nNotably, Northrop\u2019s E-2D Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. These provide the warfighter with expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.\n\nThe E-2D Hawkeye aircraft comes with some remarkable developments like the True 360-degree radar coverage, which provides uncompromised all-weather tracking and situational awareness. Moreover, the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders by utilizing the aircraft\u2019s robust network-enabled capability.\n\nSuch features make the E-2D Hawkeye aircraft an attractive choice for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. Such orders are likely to boost Northrop\u2019s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.\n\nNOC\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nFactors like increasing defense spending by developed nations, rising defense investment from emerging economies, rapidly rising geopolitical tensions worldwide like the ongoing hostility in the Middle East, and the rising incorporation of technology to elevate both the quality and efficiency of the new-age military jets have been bolstering the growth prospects of the combat jet market.\n\nThis must have prompted the Morder Intelligence firm to project a CAGR of 3.7% for the global fighter aircraft market in the 2024-2029 period. Such growth prospects should benefit Northrop, as its product portfolio offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aviation market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the 1930s, the company has been offering varied manned aircraft solutions to global customers worldwide. These solutions range from fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare. Notably, apart from E-2D, NOC builds the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber jet, which is the only long-range penetrating stealth bomber in the U.S. arsenal.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nThe abounding growth prospects of the global fighter market should also benefit other prominent defense majors like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT that manufacture combat jets.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet, the C-130 Hercules airlifter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and the F-22 Raptor jet.\n\nLMT\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 4.1%.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "If building multi-generational wealth is one of your investment objectives, you may consider buying growth stocks for the long-term portfolio. Multi-generational wealth may sound like something you need a large amount at the start to build, but with long-term compounding, you can snowball a relatively small initial investment into a small fortune.\n\nWhat makes long-term growth stocks such a strong choice for this strategy? It all has to do with the twofold way such stocks have the potential to produce above-average annualized total returns over a long time frame.\n\nThat is, high-quality long-term growth stocks can steadily appreciate in value over time in line with earnings growth. Some of these stocks can even make gains that outpace earnings growth if the market decides to \u201creward\u201d them with a re-rating to a higher valuation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlongside price appreciation, these stocks typically have consistent dividends that increase over time. If reinvested back into the stock, these dividends can further boost overall returns.\n\nThe following seven stocks stand out as names that could be winning growth stocks for the long-term investor.\n\nAmerican Water Works (AWK) A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.\n\nSource: HQuality/ShutterStock.com\n\nBased in Camden, New Jersey, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a water utility holding company. Across the U.S., American Water Works provides water and wastewater services to over 3.5 million customers in 14 states. While this may not sound like a dynamic, cutting-edge industry, I wouldn\u2019t knock the growth potential of owning a water utility stock.\n\nAccording to sell-side earnings forecasts, the company is expected to report high single-digit earnings growth over the next few years. Such growth is likely sufficient for AWK stock to sustain its current valuation of 24.9 times forward earnings. Along with the possibility of steady price appreciation, AWK has a 2.3% dividend yield. Not only that, payouts have grown by an average of 9.14% annually for the past five years.\n\nWith 15 years of consecutive dividend growth under its belt, American Water Works is a decade away from gaining \u201cDividend Aristocrat\u201d status. AWK isn\u2019t going to make you a fortune quickly, but over decades, an investment in the stock could compound into a sizable nest egg for your grandchildren.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) whose reputation as one of the top growth stocks for the long term precedes it. That is, shares in the wholesale club operator have a very strong track record in price appreciation over many years. Over the past five years, shares have surged by more than threefold.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the last decade, COST stock is up a staggering 732%. Yes, with its sterling reputation, buying COST today will be costly, and not just because each individual share costs around $850. At current prices, Costco Wholesale trades for 53 times forward earnings. If so pricey, why is it still worthy of a long-term buy? As Seeking Alpha contributor Noah\u2019s Arc Capital Management recently argued, various factors suggest that COST can sustain its valuation and continue to gain.\n\nThese factors include the discount retailer\u2019s unique business model, namely its subscription-based revenue stream, its high return on common equity, and the prospect of further new store growth via international expansion. COST has a relatively small 0.5% dividend, but payouts have increased 19 years in a row, with the latest dividend hike coming in at 13.7%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), best known as the parent company of Google and YouTube, may be your best choice out of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d regarding long-term growth potential. At least when one weighs the tech giant\u2019s growth prospects against its current valuation.\n\nRight now, GOOG stock trades for around 25 times forward earnings. This puts it at the low end of valuations for Magnificent 7 stocks. Yet as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently pointed out, despite concerns about Google\u2019s search business under threat by AI-related disruption, these worries may be overblown. Moreover, other factors, like the continued growth of Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud segment, provide further credence to forecasts calling for GOOG\u2019s earnings to continue growing in the 15% range.\n\nTo top things off, Alphabet has started to pay a dividend. While very tiny today, this 20-cent per share payout could grow substantially over time, especially as GOOG\u2019s annual earnings could hit the $10 per share mark by 2026. Other Magnificent 7 stocks could outperform in the near term, but if you\u2019re looking for a mega-cap tech stock offering the strongest chances of staying power, GOOG stands out as your best choice.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is another name commonly cited as one of the top growth stocks for the long-term investor. The defense contractor\u2019s dividend growth policy one key reason behind this long-term growth reputation. For the past 21 years, Lockheed Martin increased its dividend on an annual basis.\n\nAt current prices, LMT stock sports a 2.7% forward yield. Payouts have increased by an average of 7.7% over the past five years. Alongside steady, growing payouts, however, is the potential for more-than-satisfactory returns via price appreciation. The current geopolitical climate leaves top defense firms like Lockheed Martin poised to benefit from increased defense spending by the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAs Barrons\u2019 Al Root recently pointed out, U.S. defense spending has increased by 6% annually over the past five years, and global defense spending has accelerated since 2016. If that\u2019s not encouraging enough, Lockheed Martin\u2019s backlog is large enough to mitigate the remote possibility of near-term defense spending cuts. Besides rising in value in line with earnings growth, increased confidence that elevated growth is here to stay could lead to multiple expansions for LMT. Shares currently trade for only 17.8 times forward earnings.\n\nPaychex (PAYX) The Paychex (PAYX) sign on the side of the company's building in Mirimar, Florida.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors soured on Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) recently, but shares in the payroll processor and outsourced human resources services provider could prove to be a solid growth name to buy and hold for the long haul. PAYX recently tumbled after earnings, as uncertainty about the challenges small and medium-sized businesses face countered key positives with the earnings release.\n\nHowever, despite the pessimism, Paychex operates in a fairly resilient industry. In time, macro issues like inflation can ease, leading to a stronger environment for Paychex to thrive. Forecasts call for consistent mid-to-high single-digit earnings growth in the coming years. Dividend growth potential is also very promising with PAYX stock. In fact, back in May, I pointed out how Paychex may be one of the best dividend stocks out there.\n\nPAYX currently has a forward dividend yield of 3.3%. For nine years in a row, PAYX increased its rate of payout. Payouts have increased by an average of 9.7% annually over the past five years. The company\u2019s latest 10% dividend increase was in line with the level of dividend growth seen in recent years.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) delivered strong growth over the past decade, but shares in the steakhouse chain have been on a tear this year. Year-to-date, the stock is up by around 42%. With such a big run-up, you may initially think that shares have gotten ahead of themselves.\n\nYet while there may be potential for a correction or sell-off in the near term, TXRH stock still stands to be one of the best growth stocks for the long term. Headwinds like cost pressures are easing, the company is still reported strong levels of same-store sales growth. Best of all, the chain continues to open new locations, with 30 expected to openthis year.\n\nAll of this points to further double-digit earnings growth, which in turn translates into additional price appreciation and the high likelihood of continued high dividend increases. Shares yield 1.4% today, and payouts have grown by an average of 17.2% annually over the past five years. While pricey at 29 times forward earnings, a continued growth streak could outweigh this, resulting in strong total returns in the years to come.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) has only been a public company for one generation, but during this time shares have delivered strong returns for investors, through both capital growth and dividends. For the generations ahead, this tradition may continue, thanks to a secular growth trend: the digitization of payments.\n\nAs you likely know, Visa and its rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) effectively have a global payments duopoly. What was previously cash-based transactions continues to shift to card/digital-based transactions, enabling Visa to sustain solid revenue and earnings growth, most recently seen in the company\u2019s last quarterly earnings release. As the world keeps going cashless, expect this trend to continue.\n\nSince going public in 2008, Visa has increased its dividend. Over the past five years, Visa\u2019s payouts have grown by an average of 15.% annually. The latest quarterly dividend hike, from 45 cents to 52 cents, represented annual dividend growth of around 15.6%. The current cash dividend with V stock may seem low at 0.8%. However, as time passes, these payouts will play an even more significant role in producing long-term total returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Want Decades of Passive Income? 2 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever.",
        "content": "There's something quite pleasant about having cash deposited into your investment account quarter after quarter and year after year. Here are two outstanding dividend stocks with long histories of rewarding their shareholders with steadily rising cash payments. Both stocks can help you build your own streams of passive income.\n\nTop dividend stock No. 1: Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) helps the U.S. government and its allies protect their citizens from a growing number of threats. The company is a vital ally in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nAs a leading defense contractor, Lockheed supplies crucial technology to the U.S. military. Here are just a few examples:\n\nThe F-35 stealth aircraft serves a crucial role in the security strategies of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, as well as that of 18 allied nations. The Aegis radar system is helping U.S. forces protect merchant shipping vessels from drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea. Patriot-launched PAC-3 interceptors are enabling Ukraine to fend off Russia's aerial bombardments. An F-35 aircraft takes to the skies. Image source: Lockheed Martin.\n\nLockheed has amassed $159 billion worth of orders for its broad array of defensive platforms. Combined with the long service lives of its key products -- the F-35, for one, is expected to remain in service until at least 2080 -- this massive backlog gives investors a high degree of visibility into the company's future cash flow.\n\nManagement is committed to passing much of this cash on to shareholders via stock buybacks and a steadily rising dividend. Over the past decade, Lockheed has bought back a quarter of its shares, which has boosted per-share profits for its remaining stockholders. The defense leader has also raised its cash payout for 21 straight years. Today, Lockheed's dividend yield is a solid 2.7%.\n\nTop dividend stock No. 2: Eli Lilly\n\nFor more than 140 years, Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) has used cutting-edge science to help people live better. The healthcare leader's history is chock-full of medical breakthroughs, but its latest discovery could be the most impactful and profitable one yet.\n\nAlmost 70% of American adults are obese or overweight, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes. Fortunately, Eli Lilly has developed a game-changing drug that makes it easier for people to lose weight.\n\nZepbound, the pharmaceutical pioneer's weight-management treatment for adults, activates hormone receptors that reduce appetite. Participants in a 72-week clinical trial who received the highest dose of the drug lost 48 pounds on average.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen combined with diet and exercise, Zepbound also helped these people improve their cholesterol and blood pressure profiles. And tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can make it easier for adults with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels. Better still, recent studies suggest that tirzepatide could have positive effects for people with liver disease and sleep apnea.\n\nDue to tirzepatide's many potential health benefits, CEO Dave Ricks believes it will be the most important medicine of his 28-year career. Wall Street seems to agree. Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects Eli Lilly to be a leader in an anti-obesity drug market that will soar to $130 billion by the end of the decade. The company's profits, in turn, are projected to increase by more than 60% annually over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Using Too Much Debt?",
        "content": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nWhat Is Lockheed Martin's Net Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of March 2024, Lockheed Martin had US$19.4b of debt, up from US$15.6b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has US$2.79b in cash leading to net debt of about US$16.6b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Lockheed Martin's Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Lockheed Martin had liabilities of US$17.7b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$30.6b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.79b and US$16.3b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$29.2b.\n\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Lockheed Martin is worth a massive US$112.1b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin's net debt of 1.6 times EBITDA suggests graceful use of debt. And the alluring interest cover (EBIT of 9.2 times interest expense) certainly does not do anything to dispel this impression. And we also note warmly that Lockheed Martin grew its EBIT by 18% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Lockheed Martin's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Lockheed Martin generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 82% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nLockheed Martin's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its interest cover is also very heartening. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Lockheed Martin's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - Lockheed Martin has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) ended the recent trading session at $467.10, demonstrating a -0.01% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.41%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.12%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.71%.\n\nThe aerospace and defense company's stock has climbed by 1.34% in the past month, exceeding the Aerospace sector's loss of 1.78% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 3.53%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Lockheed Martin in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Lockheed Martin to post earnings of $6.45 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 4.16%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $17.03 billion, reflecting a 2.04% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $26.26 per share and revenue of $69.72 billion. These totals would mark changes of -5.61% and +3.18%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state. Right now, Lockheed Martin possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Lockheed Martin is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.79. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.06 of its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, LMT's PEG ratio is currently 4.38. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. LMT's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.72 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 94, positioning it in the top 38% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Quiet Blue-Chip Stocks on the Verge of a Big Breakout Rally",
        "content": "In a portfolio, it\u2019s generally growth stocks that grab the limelight. Being high-beta stocks, the price action keeps investors on the edge. However, blue-chip stocks are the silent performers besides acting as a fortress for the portfolio against extreme volatility.\n\nAt the same time, there are phases where blue-chip stocks go ballistic. Before the recent bull run, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was subdued for an extended period. However, the stock\u2019s rally in the last 18 months has compensated for the price and time correction.\n\nThe market keeps providing opportunities, and I see multiple subdued blue-chip stocks poised to break out. It\u2019s not necessary for the stocks discussed to rally like NVDA. However, I can say with some conviction that these blue-chip stocks can outperform index returns in the next three to five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the business factors that make these blue-chip ideas worth considering.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Lockheed Martin (LMT) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).3D illustration.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year, global defense spending touched record highs of $2.44 trillion. With rising geopolitical tensions, defense spending will likely continue to increase. Amidst positive industry tailwinds, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock remained sideways in the last 12 months. This is a good accumulation opportunity with the defense blue-chip trading at an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18x. Further, the blue-chip defense stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.7%.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $159 billion as of the first quarter. A strong backlog offers clear revenue and cash flow visibility. It\u2019s also likely that the backlog will continue to swell, translating into revenue growth acceleration. Further, as Lockheed invests in next-generation defense technologies, top-line growth will be supported.\n\nLockheed also has robust cash flow visibility. For the current year, the defense major has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion (mid-range). Healthy FCF will ensure steady dividend growth and value creation through share repurchase.\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nSource: Grey82/Shutterstock.com\n\nNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is another high-quality blue-chip stock that remained sideways in the last 12 months. A forward P/E of 15.7x looks attractive and the gold miner offers a dividend yield of 2.4%.\n\nOne potential catalyst for NEM stock trending higher is expansionary monetary policies. I expect the Fed to make its first rate cut before Election Day. A potentially weak dollar is likely to translate into further upside for gold. With the benefit of higher realized prices, NEM stock trend is likely to turn bullish.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a business fundamental perspective, Newmont has 128 and 155 million ounces in gold reserves and resources, respectively. Besides a strong asset base, the gold miner has an investment-grade balance sheet with a robust liquidity buffer.\n\nFurther, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $776 million for the first quarter. Considering the upside in realized gold price, it\u2019s likely that the annual operating cash flow will be more than $3.5 billion. This provides Newmont with ample headroom for aggressive investments, dividends and share repurchases.\n\nMerck (MRK) Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate building\n\nSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHolding one or a few pharmaceutical stocks in the portfolio is always a good idea. The sector is immune to economic shocks, and pharmaceutical stocks have a significantly low beta. Merck (NYSE:MRK) is among the attractively valued names to consider at a forward P/E of 15.4x. MRK stock also offers a generous dividend yield of 2.3%.\n\nPharma stocks have been relatively subdued since the pandemic. With the global disease burden on the rise, this presents a good buying opportunity. Specific to Merck, a strong pipeline of drugs provides clear growth visibility. Currently, 80 programs are in Phase 2, and 30 candidates are in Phase 3 testing.\n\nThe pipeline is currently diversified, but the oncology segment is likely to be the key growth driver. Merck expects that the oncology pipeline will translate into $20 billion in incremental sales by the mid-2030s.\n\nFor the first quarter, Merck reported healthy sales growth of 9% on a year-on-year basis to $15.8 billion. For the same period, the GAAP earnings per share surged by 68% to $1.87. Based on the guidance, healthy numbers will continue to flow, and MRK stock is likely to trend higher.\n\nChevron (CVX) a Chevron (CVX) gas station\n\nSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil has been subdued due to macroeconomic headwinds, which has translated into weakness in oil and gas exploration stocks. With rate cuts impending to drive growth, it\u2019s likely that oil will trend higher. It\u2019s, therefore, a good time to accumulate quality energy stocks. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) remained sideways in the last few quarters and looks undervalued. The 4.1% dividend yield stock is poised for a breakout rally relatively soon.\n\nA key reason to like Chevron is that the business is a cash flow machine. Last year, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $35.6 billion. If oil trends higher, it\u2019s likely that the annual operating cash flow potential will be more than $40 billion. This will provide Chevron with ample flexibility for aggressive investments and dividend growth.\n\nWith an investment-grade balance sheet, Chevron has also pursued inorganic growth. Acquiring Hess (NYSE:HES) will boost production growth and the overall cash flow potential. Overall, with low break-even assets and strong fundamentals, CVX stock is likely to be a long-term value creator.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) is possibly among the most undervalued blue-chip stocks. Even after a 20% rally in the last 12 months, T stock trades at a forward P/E of 8.5x. Further, the communication services stock offers a robust dividend yield of 5.9%.\n\nA key challenge for AT&T has been a highly leveraged balance sheet. However, the company has focused on deleveraging, and the outcome has been positive. AT&T is on track to achieve a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA of 2.5x in the first half of 2025.\n\nFor the current year, the company expects to report free cash flow of $17 to $18 billion. With positive business metrics, it\u2019s likely that FCF will continue to swell. This will support deleveraging, besides providing flexibility for dividends.\n\nMy view on higher FCF is also supported by the fact that the average revenue per user has been in an uptrend. As 5G adoption increases, the average revenue per user will likely remain healthy.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial commodities are among the most undervalued asset classes. With expansionary policies on the cards, it\u2019s a good time to bet on blue-chip commodity stocks. Vale (NYSE:VALE) stock trades at a significant valuation gap at a forward P/E of 4.9x. I expect healthy returns from the stock in the next 24 to 36 months.\n\nFor the first quarter, Vale reported iron ore sales increase of 15% from a year ago to 8.2 metric tons. The mining company recorded highest quarterly iron ore production since 2019. For the same period, copper sales increased by 22% to 14.1 kilotons.\n\nWith operational improvements, sales have increased, and Vale reported an adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 billion for the quarter. Further, free cash flow was $2 billion, even with relatively depressed commodity prices. I expect annual FCF to be more than $10 billion if commodities trend higher on expansionary policies.\n\nOverall, Vale has navigated challenging times with a healthy balance sheet. With operational improvements and the potential for an upside in commodity prices, VALE stock will likely surge higher.\n\nAltria (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria Group (NYSE:MO) stock experienced price correction in the last five years. MO stock trades at a forward P/E of 9x and offers a dividend yield of 8.4%. I believe the consumer staples stock will likely breakout on the upside.\n\nThere are two reasons for an extended time correction in the stock. First, regulatory headwinds have impacted growth in vaping and e-cigarette products.\n\nFurther, Altria is in a phase of business transformation towards the non-smoking category. This has translated into margin revenue de-growth. Having said that, the smokable segment continues to be a cash flow driver.\n\nAltria subsidiary Njoy received authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for its menthol e-vapor products. This is the only menthol e-vapor product authorized by the FDA. The brand has already broadened its distribution to over 80,000 stores.\n\nThe authorization is likely to support growth. At the same time, Altria has been gaining market share in the oral tobacco category. Therefore, the business transformation efforts yield results, and it\u2019s a matter of time before MO stock surges.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Defense Stocks to Buy Amid Peace Summit Tensions",
        "content": "Although labeled as the peace summit, an international call for an end to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine effectively did little more than harden ideological lines. While a great many support a roadmap to peace that encompasses Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, key players \u2013 namely Russia and China, along with a few others \u2013 believe differently. What can be said is that defense stocks to buy present a cynically positive framework.\n\nUnless the Russians agree to pull back their troops \u2013 something that Moscow has demonstrated zero intention of doing without receiving what Ukraine considers unacceptable concessions \u2013 and return to internationally recognized borders, the conflict will likely continue. At this point, then, the U.S. and its allies have little to do except to bolster their military capabilities.\n\nFrankly, the conflict may come down to who is going to blink first. For the U.S. to keep its superpower reputation intact, it just can\u2019t blink at all.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat makes defense stocks to buy even more compelling is that no matter who\u2019s president next, foreign policy will likely play a huge role in any administration. Being the long superpower affords the U.S. with great economic advantages that can be lost if that power is shared with other nations. While it\u2019s a controversial topic, it\u2019s time to consider these defense plays.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the biggest names in defense stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the company is important for its ability to project power. Thanks to its massive aerospace division, U.S. forces and allies maintain air superiority across vast regions of the world. Of course, Lockheed is vital in myriad other areas. However, the ability to respond to saber rattling has never been more important.\n\nFinancially, LMT stock doesn\u2019t offer the most exciting profile, I\u2019m just keeping it real. However, it benefits from consistency. Between the second quarter of last year to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average earnings per share hit nearly $6.91. This print translated to an average earnings surprise of 5.5%.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Lockheed posted net income of $6.78 billion or earnings of $27.34 per share. Revenue in the period reached $69.64 billion. The latest quarterly sales rate (year-over-year) landed at 13.7%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate a slight dip in EPS to $26.27. However, revenue could rise by 3.2% to $69.76 billion. Further, it offers a forward yield of 2.69%. Again, LMT isn\u2019t exciting but it\u2019s one of the top defense stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother revered (and feared) name among defense stocks to buy, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) makes a strong case for inclusion in your portfolio. Frankly, tensions in Europe are only going to rise unless the Russians encounter a catastrophic battlefield defeat. In the meantime, China consistently presents an adversarial presence. Essentially, Northrop\u2019s myriad weapons systems keeps honest people honest.\n\nFinancially, Northrop occupies similar ground to Lockheed Martin. Neither company is particularly riveting from an investment standpoint. However, Northrop \u2013 like its rival \u2013 is consistent. During the past four quarters, it posted EPS of $6.03. This print translated to an earnings surprise of just under 6%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Northrop posted net income of $2.16 billion or $14.35 per share. In the cycle, revenue reached $40.12 billion. Further, the company\u2019s most recent quarterly sales growth rate hit 8.9%. For fiscal 2024, experts believe EPS may rise 6.35% to land at $24.77. On the top line, sales could rise 4.6% to reach $41.11 billion.\n\nLastly, Northrop offers a forward dividend yield of 1.92%. It\u2019s a solid idea if you\u2019re looking for a stable candidate among defense stocks to buy.\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Raytheon Technologies, RTX (NYSE:RTX) is a key player within the aerospace and defense sector. Per its public profile, RTX provides systems and services for commercial, military and government customers. It\u2019s easily one of the top defense stocks to buy thanks to its weapons systems, especially its interceptor missiles.\n\nRaytheon of course plays a major role in responding to saber rattling. However, it\u2019s also important to back up the tough talk: Raytheon does a lot of backing up, let\u2019s put it that way. Even better, RTX stock isn\u2019t all doom, gloom and boom. In the past four quarters, the underlying company\u2019s EPS landed at roughly $1.27. This print translated to an earnings surprise of 6.45%.\n\nIn the TTM period, RTX posted net income of $3.48 billion or $2.54 per share. Moreover, revenue in the cycle hit $71.01 billion. The latest quarterly sales growth rate stands at 12.1%. For fiscal 2024, analysts see EPS rising by 6.3% to hit $5.38. On the top line, revenue may clock in at $79.07 billion, up 6.4% from last year.\n\nRTX offers a decent forward yield of 2.48% for those on the fence.\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries (HII) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the distinct plays among defense stocks to buy, Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) designs and builds military ships. It\u2019s also responsible for their overhauling and repairs. This business will be increasingly significant, not only from a capacity perspective but also as a projection of power. Unlike the Russians, the U.S. commands a dominant naval force.\n\nFurther, with tensions rising with China, both the current and future administrations can\u2019t afford to show weakness. The U.S. Navy will be called upon to demonstrate the nation\u2019s broader military supremacy. Therefore, I see a huge demand influx for HII stock. So far, the financials bear this out. During the past four quarters, the average earnings surprise came out to a robust 21.03%.\n\nIn the TTM period, Huntington posted net income of $705 million, translating to $17.71 per share. Revenue in this cycle reached $11.59 billion. The most recent quarterly sales growth rate comes in at 4.9%. For fiscal 2024, experts see a slight dip in EPS to $16.56. However, the top line may rise modestly to $11.72 billion from last year\u2019s $11.45 billion.\n\nHuntington also offers a forward yield of 2.07%. While you might not get rich with HII, it\u2019s one of the most relevant defense stocks to buy.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA higher-risk, higher-reward idea within the aerospace and defense sector, AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) flew to fame with its self-destruct zones. Essentially, military operators can hide behind cover while directly an unmanned drone. Should a target be cited, an operator can deliberately crash into it, with the aim of destruction or disablement.\n\nDrone warfare represented one of the key takeaways in the conflict in Ukraine. I\u2019d imagine that future conflicts will involve the same, meaning that AeroVironment may cynically benefit from increased demand. It hasn\u2019t always been the most consistent financial performer, with the company missing in its fiscal Q1 2023 report. However, during the past four quarters, its average earnings surprise clocked in at 107.5%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, AeroVironment posted a net loss of $106.85 million or $4.44 per share in the red. However, sales hit $705.78 million. Further, the most recent sales growth rate soared to 38.8%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate a big jump in EPS to $2.81. Also, revenue may reach $708.15 million, a 31% increase from last year. It\u2019s one of the enticing defense stocks to buy.\n\nBoeing (BA) Royal Air Force Boeing (BA) Chinook HC2A (352) [ZH895] lifting off from runway\n\nSource: InsectWorld / Shutterstock.com\n\nAerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) presents a controversial narrative, not just for the underlying relevance to defense stocks to buy but also because of troubles in its civilian unit. Without going into all the details, Boeing for the last few years has struggled due to safety concerns associated with its jetliners. That\u2019s the kind of stuff that happens when doors blow off airplanes.\n\nIt appears that the controversies have weighed on the firm\u2019s financials. In the past four quarters, Boeing incurred an average loss per share of $1.33. In fairness, the red ink came in at a lesser degree than experts anticipated. Therefore, the average quarterly surprise came out to 18.08%. Still, BA stock is down heavily on a year-to-date basis.\n\nIn the TTM period, Boeing suffered a net loss of $2.15 billion or $3.54 per share. Sales in the period landed at $76.44 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts expect a major improvement to a loss of $1.36. Last year, the company posted a loss of $5.81 per share.\n\nOn the top line, sales may dip 5.4% to $73.58 billion. Still, a recovery could materialize in fiscal 2025, with sales projected to rise to $88.36 billion.\n\nBlacksky Technology (BKSY) futuristic image of earth from space to represent aerospace stocks\n\nIf you want to roll the dice with your defense stocks to buy, Blacksky Technology (NYSE:BKSY) might be an enticing prospect. For all intents and purposes, when you consider the lowly share price and the nothing-burger market capitalization, Blacksky is a penny stock. However, it\u2019s part of the burgeoning geospatial intelligence ecosystem. Therefore, it could play a huge role in critical data collection.\n\nUnderstanding where enemy positions are located along with potential areas of movement will offer military operators a potentially pivotal advantage. Therefore, BKSY stock could reasonably see a demand influx if more people recognize the opportunity. For now, it\u2019s a hit-or-miss affair financially. Still, it must be said that in terms of mitigating expected losses per share, Blacksky posted a quarterly surprise of 11.45% between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024.\n\nDuring the TTM period, the company incurred a net loss of $52.35 million or 37 cents per share. Revenue in the period hit $100.33 million. For fiscal 2024, experts believe Blacksky will post a loss per share of 34 cents, an improvement from last year\u2019s 39 cents in the red.\n\nRevenue may land at $108.94 million, up 15.3%. Further, fiscal 2025 sales could soar to $138.54 million, up 27.2%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As the race to space heats up, the top space stocks to buy are delivering high returns.\n\nIn the last few years, the commercialization of space has reached new highs with governments investing heavily in commercial space assets. Exploring all that space has to offer is becoming more common than ever before. And it has some envisioning the possibility of life on Mars!\n\nGiven the increased interest in space travel, companies leading the charge are experiencing explosive growth. This has served as a boon for investors looking to capitalize on returns beyond earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe potential of the space industry is undeniable. According to McKinsey and Company, the space economy will be worth a whopping $1.8 trillion by 2035. That number is up significantly from $630 billion in 2023. This growth will be driven by demand for positioning and navigation services, satellite connectivity and insights powered by AI.\n\nAs one of the most promising sectors in 2024, space stocks are an attractive investment option for those seeking out of this world returns.\n\nVirgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce a fever dream, commercial space travel is now a reality, thanks to companies like Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE). It stands in contrast to traditional space travel which typically involves launching satellites and drones into space. Yet, SPCE is operating fully manned passenger flights beyond the earth\u2019s orbit. Virgin Galactic Holdings successfully launched its seventh crewed suborbital spaceflight on June 8th. It sent a crew of six on the VSS Unity Space flight.\n\nAnd if fully operational space travel isn\u2019t reason enough to invest in SPCE, the financials are not too shabby either. In its previous quarter, operating expenses came in lower at $164 million compared to $113 million in 2023. This is an impressive feat, given that space travel is a pricey endeavor.\n\nA second metric worth looking at is the backlog. Virgin Galactic Holdings\u2019 space flights currently have a 800 person waitlist. Four passengers a flight at $600,000 a ticket translates into a lot of revenue in the pipeline.\n\nNow the company did lose money this year. But the losses were lower year-over-year (YOY). Moreover, given that space travel is a growing business with massive potential, Virgin Galactic Holdings remains one of the best space stocks to buy.\n\nLockheedMartin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe rise in defense spending amidst geopolitical tensions has been a huge tailwind for Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). It\u2019s a leader in the defense sector with several highly-advanced jets, aircraft and weapon systems to its name. LMT stock gives plenty of reasons for investors to get behind its name. However, given that this is a story about space stocks, it\u2019s worth exploring the company\u2019s developments beyond earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, the Lockheed Martin Space business has seen plenty of action. Last week the Pentagon announced that Lockheed was awarded a $997.5 million contract extension for the continued development and testing of missile warning satellites. This brings the total value of the project to $8.2 billion. In other news, NASA selected Lockheed Martin to build a next-gen spacecraft for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The total value of the contract is approximately $2.27 billion.\n\nAnd, while the future prospects of its space business remain optimistically bright, performance in the previous quarter was just as impressive. Revenue in the Lockheed Space sector came in at $3.3 billion, up from the same period last year. Additionally, operating profits were up by 16% with a $33 billion backlog.\n\nWith a steady stream of contract wins and strong financial performance, LMT is undoubtedly one of the top space stocks to buy right now.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpaceX may dominate the rocket industry but Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) isn\u2019t too far behind. In its first quarter, the company successfully launched four rockets into space and saw its revenue rise by 69%  YOY.\n\nAnd after inking two new deals, RKLB is giving investors more reasons to celebrate this stock. Earlier this month, the company signed its largest deal with the Japanese earth observation company, Synspective. It is scheduled to launch 10 Electron rockets as part of the contract.\n\nThis news comes right after Rocket Lab USA\u2019s deal with the French-based company Kineis to set up IoT satellites across the globe. The contract will include 25 satellites that will be launched over eight months through 2025. Needless to say, Rocket Lab USA is at the top of its game.\n\nWhen considering smaller companies as potential investment opportunities, the pipeline strength is perhaps the best indicator of long-term growth. Rocket Lab USA\u2019s high-value contracts suggest plenty of upside in the long-haul.\n\nShare prices have wavered on profitability concerns in recent months. But as the company delivers on its contracts, this remains one of the best space stocks to buy this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "content": "After a couple of rough years during which the sector underwent extensive restructuring, smart investors are once again paying attention to metaverse stocks.\n\nDue to higher spending and focus on AI, investors tend to ignore the metaverse, but the market is too substantial to ignore, expected to be worth about $116.74 billion in 2024 and $669.96 billion by 2029, growing at a rate of 41.83% per year. McKinsey & Companyestimates a $5 trillion metaverse economy by 2030.\n\nPart of the allure of metaverse stocks is that the concept has several use cases; for example, the U.S. military and government are studying metaverse applications, including augmented reality training simulations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the same time, for companies, the metaverse concept is still relevant post-pandemic, considering the secular growth in the work-from-home trend; roughly 12.7% of full-time employees globally work from home and more remote work means the metaverse can be crucial to future workflow management.\n\nHowever, since this is still a developing sector, it\u2019s best to select metaverse stocks with solid analyst ratings, healthy financials, diversified portfolios, and healthy upside potential.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

Recent Blender and Adobe integrations provide Omniverse\u2019s functionality to millions more users. Blender supports USD, and Adobe\u2019s Substance 3D simplifies material changes.\n\nNVIDIA has also teamed up with several big names to promote metaverse technology. For instance, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) practices wildfire response using Omniverse. Omniverse helps SHoP Architectscollaborate on building plans in real-time and create gorgeous visualizations.\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA leads neural graphics, which blend AI with traditional images to speed up and improve virtual environments. Instant NeRF and other breakthroughs convert 2D images into 3D scenes, speeding up metaverse material creation.\u200b\n\nUltimately, due to its speed and low power consumption, RTX technology is easier for design, visualization, and AI-accelerated tool professionals.

There were 19% more bookings, for a total of $923.8 million. Roblox recorded a net loss of $270.6 million, which is a little more than the same time last year, even though sales went up. However, the results mark the third time in a row RBLX went past Wall Street estimates, displaying post-pandemic robustness.\n\nIn addition, Ikearecently announced a new concept for employing virtual workers in its Roblox metaverse shop.

        "content": "Reflecting On Defense Contractors Stocks\u2019 Q1 Earnings: AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV)\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q1 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 14 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.2%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the defense contractors stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 0.5% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV)\n\nFocused on the future of autonomous military combat, AeroVironment (NASDAQGS:AVAV) specializes in advanced unmanned aircraft systems and electric vehicle charging solutions.\n\nAeroVironment reported revenues of $197 million, up 5.9% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 4.2%.

        "content": "The Boeing Company BA recently clinched a modification contract to procure MH-47G renew build rotary helicopter. The award has been offered by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) MacDill Air Force Base, FL.\n\nValued at $115.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2027. Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Ridley Park, PA.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Boeing?\n\nRecurring geopolitical tensions worldwide, along with the evolving dynamics of modern warfare, which requires swift and agile aerial support, have been prompting nations across the globe to invest more in lethal air forces. To this end, it is imperative to mention that combat helicopters play a critical role in air warfare missions, thanks to their rapid technological advancement over the last decade, which has made them more lethal, survivable as well as adaptable for a wide range of aerial missions.\n\nConsequently, Boeing, being a prominent manufacturer of such new-age military helicopters, has been witnessing a solid flow of orders from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies for its combat-proven rotorcraft. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nNotably, its MH-47G is a special operation variant of the CH-47 Chinook multi-role, heavy-lift helicopter. In December 2023, Boeing secured a contract worth $271 million from the U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (\u201cUSASOAC\u201d) for six remanufactured MH-47G Block II aircraft. With this, the company had 42 MH-47G aircraft under contract with USASOAC, as of 2023-end.\n\nSuch contract wins, including the latest one, should boost the top-line performance of Boeing Defense, Space & Security segment, which registered a year-over-year improvement of 6% in the last reported quarter.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nAs nations seek to enhance their military capabilities, the demand for multi-role combat helicopters that are capable of performing diverse missions, from reconnaissance to close air support, is also rising. This might have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to project that the military helicopters market will witness a CAGR of more than 2.9% during the 2024-2030 period.\n\nSuch expanding market prospects should boost Boeing\u2019s growth, thanks to its well-established position in manufacturing combat helicopters like AH-64 Apache, MH-139 and AH-6 light attack helicopter, apart from the MH-47G helicopter. Notably, its AH-64 Apache represents the backbone of the U.S. Army\u2019s attack helicopter fleet and a growing number of international defense forces.\n\nOther defense primes that are expected to reap the benefits of the military helicopter market have been discussed below.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirbus EADSY is one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced military helicopters.

This increased utilization, along with the traditional roles in defense and space industries, has led to a noticeable rise in demand for advanced GEO satellites. One area experiencing a particularly high demand is the need for accurate and timely weather data as extreme weather events become more common due to climate change.\r\n\r\nThis must have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to expect the GEO Satellite market to witness a CAGR of 3.7% over the 2024-2029 period. Such a solid growth opportunity offered by the global GEO Satellite market should bode well for LMT.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin collaborates with NASA, NOAA and other governmental agencies to offer state-of-the-art satellite systems for Earth observation missions. In addition to the GOES-U satellite, Lockheed Martin offers a broader variety of GEO satellites in its product line. LMT\u2019s GOES-R satellite series provides vital atmospheric, hydrologic, oceanic, climatic, solar and space data, significantly improving the identification and monitoring of environmental events.\r\n\r\nGiven the growth of the GEO satellite market, LMT's recent launch is indicative of the high demand the company enjoys in this industry and suggests that there may be more such launches in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Moves\n\nApart from Lockheed Martin, the growing GEO satellite market also provides growth opportunities to other aerospace players like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC and Airbus Group EADSY, which hold a strong presence in this space.\r\n\r\nBoeing has created several notable GEO satellite products throughout the years, serving a wide range of government, broadcasting and communication needs. Its flagship model, the 702 series GEO satellites, can operate in geosynchronous, medium-Earth and low-Earth orbits.\r\n\r\nBoeing has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 0.9% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman's experience with satellite systems and payloads has contributed to the development of advanced weather monitoring capabilities. The JPSS-2 satellite, manufactured by the company, offers meteorological data and observations to help anticipate and prepare for extreme weather events, as well as monitor long-term climate changes.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%.

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Buy With $875 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Defense and aerospace companies can be underrated long-term investments. A handful of power players dominate the industry, enjoying competitive advantages thanks to their constant innovation, deep pockets, and strong ties to the U.S. government and its allies.\n\nThey also benefit from the fact that America faces numerous (and varied) threats. At the moment, war and lesser conflicts are taking place in Europe and the Middle East. Meanwhile, emerging national economies (like those in BRICS) have created economic pressure on Western countries like the United States, which has long had tense relationships with some Eastern powers.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that America's strength protects America but it also creates global tension, which means that defense spending will likely be a priority for the U.S. government for the foreseeable future: US Government Defense Spending with Forecast Chart\n\nGeneral Dynamics(NYSE: GD), Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT), and RTX(NYSE: RTX) are three of the world's six largest defense and aerospace companies. Their products and services span land, sea, air, and space, and they are poised to grow for decades to come as key partners in America's defense efforts.\n\nThe best part? You can own stock in all three for under $900.\n\nHere is what you need to know about these three buy-and-hold defense stocks.\n\n1. General Dynamics (trading around $300 a share)\n\nDefense companies understandably depend primarily on government spending for revenue, but General Dynamics offers more diversification than most. Its aerospace unit builds private jets and provides aviation services to companies and high-net-worth clients. The company's marine division is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines. Lastly, its combat and technologies segments build land vehicles, weapons systems, and software used for IT and mission control.\n\nPolitics can create volatility, primarily when politicians debate America's defense budget. The budget doesn't always go up, stagnating for periods at a time. That can impact companies like General Dynamics. Still, revenue and earnings have historically marched higher if you're patient enough. GD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThat seems poised to continue. Analysts believe General Dynamics will grow earnings by an average of 12% annually over the long term. This sets investors up for double-digit returns once you factor in the company's 1.9% dividend yield. Those looking for investment exposure to a little bit of everything should give General Dynamics a hard look.\n\n2. Lockheed Martin (trading around $472 a share)\n\nInvestors might have seen the F-35 in the news for its potential $2 trillion lifetime program cost. It's probably fair to say that it is Lockheed Martin's most famous product. However, the defense behemoth builds many products across its business units, including jets and helicopters, naval ships, satellites and spacecraft, missile systems, and cybersecurity offerings. The company's space segment represents nearly a fifth of revenue, making the stock an excellent pick for long-term exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile controversial, the F-35 program has become a cornerstone for America's defense, with a potential runtime through 2088. It arguably sets a high floor for Lockheed Martin's business, which should give investors confidence that it will grow for decades. LMT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite the F-35's presence, analysts are more cautious about Lockheed Martin's growth. Analyst estimates call for annualized growth of 4% for the next three to five years. That sets investors up for high-single-digit returns when factoring in the stock's 2.7% yield. Looking further out, it's hard not to like Lockheed Martin's space unit as a potential growth catalyst down the road. Investors can look at Lockheed Martin as a high-floor, lower-ceiling investment.\n\n3. RTX (trading around $102 a share)\n\nA 2020 merger between Raytheon Technologies and United Technologies formed RTX, the world's largest defense company with $71 billion in annual revenue. RTX has a massive footprint in the aviation sector. Its Collins Aerospace unit sells aircraft, components, and systems to military and commercial clients. At the same time, Pratt & Whitney is a separate unit and leading manufacturer of aircraft engines and auxiliary power units. Its Raytheon segment houses its military offerings, which include weapons, systems, and components for air, land, sea, and space.\n\nThe merger brought with it accounting adjustments and spinoffs that impacted GAAP earnings. However, revenue is at all-time highs, and analysts expect profits to boost back with earnings per share of approximately $5.39 this year. Long-term estimates peg earnings growth at 11% annualized over the long term, so the future looks bright for RTX and its shareholders. RTX Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nLike General Dynamics, RTX offers investors added diversity in commercial business. Pratt & Whitney's leadership in critical aircraft components is a wide-moat competitive advantage that should help the company achieve consistent performance over the years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in General Dynamics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in General Dynamics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and General Dynamics wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin-Built GOES-U Weather Satellite Successfully Launched",
        "content": "NOAA's newest satellite will complete the GOES-R series and provide\u00a0critical weather and climate data\n\nKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla., June 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0An advanced weather satellite built by Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched today from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 5:26 p.m. ET. Lifted to space aboard a Space X Falcon Heavy rocket, the GOES-U satellite successfully deployed its large solar array to generate electrical power and has established communications with mission operators. The GOES-U weather satellite launched to space on from Florida on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nGOES-U is the final satellite in NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) - R series of four satellites. After it reaches geostationary orbit, approximately two weeks after launch, GOES-U will be renamed GOES-19. Once in operations over the East Coast of North America, the satellite be known as GOES East, and will provide advanced weather imagery, atmospheric measurements and real-time mapping of lightning activity, in addition to critical space weather observations.\n\n\"The launch of GOES-U is the culmination of more than 16 years of designing, building and launching four important weather satellites for our nation,\" said Jagdeep Shergill, GOES-U program manager and director of Geo Weather Programs at Lockheed Martin. \"Since the launch of the first GOES-R satellite, our nation has had more accurate weather forecasts and more timely severe storm warnings, and this critical service has positively affected everyone in the U.S.\"\n\nNOAA's GOES-R satellites, and soon GOES-U, provide crucial data for weather forecasting, severe storm tracking and climate monitoring. With their advanced instruments and rapid updates, they improve detection of atmospheric phenomena like hurricanes, wildfires and lighting. This real-time data aids the National Weather Service and meteorologist in early warnings, disaster preparedness and resource management, ultimately saving lives and mitigating economic losses.\n\nThe GOES-U spacecraft features two high-tech instruments built by Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technology Center in\u00a0Palo Alto, California:\n\nGeostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), which is a first-of-its-kind operational lightning mapper that tracks lightning\u00a0across the U.S.\u00a0in real-time. GLM allows meteorologists to quickly identify intensifying storms and take appropriate action. In 2020, GLM captured a lightning megaflash nearly 500 miles long that broke the world record for longest lightning flash. Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI), focuses on space weather and measures the sun in extreme ultraviolet wavelength range. SUVI is essential to understanding active areas on the sun and predicting solar events that may disrupt power utilities, communication or navigation systems here on Earth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOES-U is the final satellite of the GOES-R series which will provide critical weather and climate date into the 2030s. Following GOES-U, Lockheed Martin was selected by NASA to develop the nation's next generation weather satellite constellation, Geostationary Extended Observations (GeoXO), for NOAA. GeoXO's new capabilities will deliver more accurate weather forecasting and address emerging environmental issues and challenges. GeoXO, the GOES-R series and the nation's weather satellites are vital infrastructure for national resilience.\n\nNOAA funds, manages and will operate the GOES-R series satellites. NASA oversees the acquisition and development of the GOES-R spacecraft, instruments and launch vehicles. The program is co-located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nCheck out additional GOES-U imagery\u00a0here and b-roll video here.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery.

        "title": "Northrop (NOC) Wins Contract to Support E-2D Hawkeye Jets",
        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s NOC business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems, recently clinched a contract involving its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye jets. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $13.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by June 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Northrop will manufacture and supply 12 motor controllers, 13 n-voice and data recorders, and 12 standard automatic flight control systems. These equipment will be provided to aid production efforts for E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft.\n\nWork related to this deal will be carried out in Grand Rapids, MI; Los Angeles, CA; and Endicott, NY.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Northrop?\n\nNations across the globe are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment worldwide. In this context, military aircraft that play a critical role in military missions have also been witnessing a significant rise in demand. This, in turn, has been ushering in solid order flows for major combat aircraft manufacturers like Northrop.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Northrop\u2019s E-2D Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. These provide the warfighter with expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.\n\nThrough its effective radar sensor and robust network-enabled capability, the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders.\n\nSuch features of the aircraft make it an attractive choice for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. Such orders are likely to boost Northrop\u2019s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.\n\nNOC\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nFactors like increasing defense spending by developed nations, rising defense investment from emerging economies, rapidly rising geopolitical tensions worldwide like the ongoing hostility in the Middle East, and the rising incorporation of technology to elevate both the quality and efficiency of the new-age military jets have been bolstering the growth prospects of the combat jet market.\n\nThis must have prompted the Morder Intelligence firm to project a CAGR of 3.7% for the global fighter aircraft market in the 2024-2029 period. Such growth prospects should benefit Northrop as its product portfolio offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aviation market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the 1930s, the company has been offering varied manned aircraft solutions to global customers worldwide. These solutions range from fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare. Notably, apart from E-2D, NOC builds the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber jet, which is the only long-range penetrating stealth bomber in the U.S. arsenal. Among unmanned air solutions, its MQ-4C Triton deserves a special mention because it provides real-time intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting (ISR&T) over vast ocean and coastal regions.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nThe abounding growth prospects of the military aviation market should also benefit other defense majors like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT that manufacture combat jets.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet, the C-130 Hercules airlifter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and the F-22 Raptor jet.\n\nLMT\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 4.1%. Shares of LMT have returned 7% to its investors in the past year.\n\nBoeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment\u2019s primary products include fixed-wing military aircraft, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. The segment also manufactures rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.\n\nBoeing\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 25.5%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 17.83%.\n\nTextron\u2019s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron\u2019s renowned products include the Beechcraft T-6C trainer and the AT-6 Wolverine.\n\nThe company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates growth of 5.6% from the previous year\u2019s reported number.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Northrop have lost 2.3% compared with the industry\u2019s 7.8% decline.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share, indicating a change of -4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $69.72 billion and $72.44 billion estimates indicate +3.2% and +3.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Lockheed Martin (LMT) ending at $471.51, denoting a +0.84% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.67%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.09%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 0.05% over the past month, outpacing the Aerospace sector's loss of 1.25% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 2.73% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Lockheed Martin in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $6.45, showcasing a 4.16% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $17.03 billion, up 2.04% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $26.26 per share and revenue of $69.72 billion, which would represent changes of -5.61% and +3.18%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Lockheed Martin. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. As of now, Lockheed Martin holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Lockheed Martin currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.81. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.93.\n\nMeanwhile, LMT's PEG ratio is currently 4.39. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Aerospace - Defense industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.78.\n\nThe Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 77, positioning it in the top 31% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "RTX Secures a Contract to Build AN/APY-10 Radar Systems",
        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently secured a contract involving its AN/APY-10 Radar Systems. The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $35 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2028. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will manufacture and supply 18 AN/APY-10 Radar Systems for the P-8A Poseidon aircraft.\n\nOf these 18 radars, 14 will be delivered to the government of Canada, three to Germany\u2019s government and one to the U.S. Navy. Work related to this deal will be executed in McKinney, TX.\n\nRTX & Radars\n\nWith the rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions globally in recent times, nations across the globe have been significantly boosting their defense arsenal. Since radars constitute a vital part of this arsenal, escalation in defense spending has been boosting investments in radars as well.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that while radars have been in use since World War II for locating threats and targets, they are being used today for multiple purposes like ground surveillance, missile control, fire control, moving target indication, weapons location and vehicle search.\n\nThis must have been ushering in solid order flow for radar manufacturing companies like RTX in the form of contract wins like the latest one. Notably, RTX\u2019s AN/APY-10 is a multi-mission maritime and overland surveillance radar developed for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft. It is capable of performing long-range surface search and target tracking, periscope detection as well as ship imaging.\n\nRTX\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nThe demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like the rise in defense spending of emerging economies, increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft.\n\nThis has set the stage for ample growth opportunities for the military radar market and must have prompted the Morder Intelligence firm to project a CAGR of 5.2% during 2024-2029 for the aforementioned market. Such growth projections bode well for prominent radar manufacturers like RTX.\n\nImpressively, RTX\u2019s product portfolio consists of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars as well as air dominance radars. Radars like AN-TPY-2, APG-79, AN/SPY-6 and APG-82 are some of the company\u2019s combat-proven products that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market, apart from AN/APY-10.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nRTX apart, other defense contractors that are major radar manufacturers and thus expected to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the global military radar market are discussed below:\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: Its radars are the choice of more than 45 nations on six continents. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes various radar systems like AN/APY-9 radar, airborne ground surveillance radar systems, AN/TPQ-53 radar systems, SPY-7, the long-range discrimination radar, FPS-117 and a few more.\r\n\r\nLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.10%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nL3Harris Technologies LHX: The company manufactures combat-proven radars like SPS-48, land-based surveillance radar, AN/APY-11 Multimode radar, Tactical Air Surveillance radar, AN/SPS-48G Long range 3D surveillance radar and many more.\u00a0 Notably, its Vigilant family of software-defined, radar electronic support measures solutions is essential for survival and dominance in the electromagnetic threat environment of the modern battlefield.\n\nStory continues\n\nL3Harris boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 9.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: As a pioneer in Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, NOC has been at the forefront of AESA innovations for more than 60 years. Its diverse product portfolio includes a handful of other radars like the F-35 fire control radar and the Distributed Aperture System, the LONGBOW Fire Control Radar, the Scalable Agile Beam Radar, the APR-39 DV (2) digital radar warning receiver and a few more.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) shareholders have earned a 8.0% CAGR over the last five years",
        "content": "The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 29% over five years, which is below the market return. Meanwhile, the last twelve months saw the share price rise 1.8%.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Lockheed Martin achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.5% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Lockheed Martin's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Lockheed Martin, it has a TSR of 47% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nLockheed Martin shareholders gained a total return of 4.7% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 8% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 1 warning sign  with Lockheed Martin , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

        "content": "STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Two Lockheed Martin subsidiaries have agreed to pay the federal government $70 million for overcharging the Navy for aircraft parts, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Friday.\n\nThe federal agency says Sikorsky Support Services, based in Stratford, Connecticut, and Derco Aerospace, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, knowingly entered into an improper subcontract for spare parts and materials for aircrafts used to train Navy pilots.\n\nUnder the contract, Sikorsky purchased the parts from Derco at the cost Derco paid other suppliers, plus a 32% markup.\n\nSikorsky then billed the Navy for the price it paid Derco, in violation of federal regulations barring such arrangements, which prosecutors said drive up government costs.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s settlement demonstrates that the Justice Department will ensure that government contractors do not skirt the law and engage in self-dealing that may artificially inflate their charges at the expense of the American taxpayers,\" Brian Boynton, head of the DOJ's civil division, said in a statement.\n\nSpokespersons for Lockheed Martin didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday.\n\nProsecutors said the settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by a former employee of Derco under whistleblower provision of the federal False Claims Act.\n\nDarrin Jones, of the U.S. Department of Defense's Office of Inspector General, said the settlement should serve as a deterrent for those looking to exploit the agency's procurement process.\n\n\u201cOverinflation of parts and material costs for the repair and maintenance of aircraft affected naval air training and is a disservice to the American taxpayer,\u201d added Greg Gross, of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service's Economic Crimes Field Office.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China said Friday it has banned a number of business units of American aviation manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp. and three of its executives over arms deals the company has signed with Taiwan, the self-ruling island it claims as its own territory.\n\nThe statement from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the company\u2019s cooperation with Taiwan had violated the country\u2019s sovereignty, standard terminology in its discussions of any outside dealings that support the island's government.\n\nThe effects of the sanctions appeared largely symbolic since military cooperation between the U.S. and China has been suspended since the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s crackdown on student-led pro-democracy protests in Beijing and other cities in 1989.\n\nNamed under the sanctions were Lockheed Martin Missile System Integration Lab, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories and Lockheed Martin Ventures. Top executives James Donald Taiclet, Frank Andrew St. John and Jesus Malave were listed as banned from traveling to China.\n\nChina has been steadily growing its domestic aircraft industry, producing parts, planes and services for Airbus and producing its own commercial jets. Foreign technology has played a large part in that process, but Chinese companies have increasingly developed the means to replace their overseas suppliers.\n\nTaiwan relies heavily on U.S. suppliers for arms, even as it works to boost its own defense industries and increase mandatory military service for men from four months to one year. That comes against the backdrop of China's rising threat to encircle or invade Taiwan to achieve what it calls a historical mission to annex the island. Taiwan was formerly a Japanese colony and separated from mainland China amid civil war in 1949.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "General Dynamics (GD) Wins $203M Contract for DDG 51 Combat Ships",
        "content": "General Dynamics Corp.\u2019s GD business unit, Bath Iron Works, recently clinched a contract to provide planning yard services for its DDG 51 guided-missile destroyer ships. The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $202.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Jul 31, 2029. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Bath, ME.\n\nThe options included in this contract, on being exercised, should bring the cumulative value of this contract to $1.13 billion.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring General Dynamics?\n\nNations across the globe are fortifying their defense spending on military weapons and arsenals as they look to strengthen their defense capabilities. This also includes augmented spending on navy ships for enhanced sea warfare capabilities.\n\nSuch increased spending tends to benefit General Dynamics, with its Bath Iron Works business unit being an expert in manufacturing navy ships and providing modernization and lifecycle support for the U.S. Navy.\n\nNotably, General Dynamics\u2019 DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers witness significant demand owing to their wide range of advanced warfighting capabilities in multi-threat air, surface and subsurface environments. These also offer protection against a wide range of threats, including ballistic missiles. Their strong demand is evident from the fact that in 2023, the company won a contract from the Navy for the construction of three Flight III DDG-51 destroyers, with a total of 12 ships in backlog (scheduled for delivery through 2032).\n\nSuch strong demand, in tandem with excellence in providing unique capabilities in shipbuilding, must have been boosting GD\u2019s order flows, like the latest one.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAs demand for an efficient security system that can strengthen naval sea warfare capabilities rises, so does the prospect of the naval ship market. This must have encouraged the Mordor Intelligence firm to project that the global naval combat vessels market will witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2024-2029 period.\n\nThis growth opportunity should boost General Dynamics\u2019 operating results as it is one of the prime contractors of navy ships. Notably, GD\u2019s Marine Systems segment is the leading designer and builder of surface combatant and auxiliary ships for the U.S. Navy. The segment also provides comprehensive post-delivery services to modernize and extend the service life of Navy ships. It also maintains the most sophisticated marine engineering expertise in the world to support future capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch expertise of GD in manufacturing, as well as providing valuable services for naval combat ships, should usher in more order flows for the company, backed by the growing demand in the naval combat vessels market, like the latest one. Such contract wins should boost GD\u2019s revenue generation prospects in the coming years.\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nGD apart, other defense majors poised to benefit from the expanding naval combat vessels market, on virtue of their strong presence in this space, are discussed below:\n\nBAE Systems BAESY: It designs, builds, commissions, repairs and supports a full range of complex naval ships, from offshore patrol vessels to aircraft carriers.

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China has imposed sanctions against some Lockheed Martin Corp subsidiaries and senior executives over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, China's foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nChina will freeze movable, immovable and other kinds of property of Lockheed Martin's senior executives including its chairman James Donald Taiclet, and will bar them from entering the country, the statement on Friday said.\n\nThe companies on the sanction list include Lockheed Martin Missile System Integration Lab, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories and Lockheed Martin Ventures, according to the statement.\n\nChina has repeatedly called on the U.S., an important international backer and arms supplier for democratically-governed Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory, to stop its arms sales to the island.\n\nBeijing has applied sanctions on U.S. companies including Lockheed Martin on numerous occasions for selling arms to Taiwan.\n\nIn September last year, China said it would impose sanctions against Lockheed and Northrop Grumman under China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.\n\nIt also placed sanctions against Lockheed and Raytheon in 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023 - with the 2022 action the first under China's new anti-foreign sanctions law.\n\nChina's wide-ranging law to counter foreign sanctions came into force in 2021 in an apparent move to legalise tit-for-tat retaliation against punitive actions taken against it by foreign countries.\n\n(Reporting by Ella Cao, Ethan Wang and Ryan Woo, Editing by William Maclean and Elaine Hardcastle)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Stellar Space Stocks to Buy for Stratospheric Return Potential",
        "content": "While many exciting ideas compete for your dollars in the capital market, few sectors are as groundbreaking as space stocks to buy. At the core of this narrative is the push for exploring new boundaries and possibilities. It\u2019s really one of the few frontier arenas available.\n\nFrom an individual investor\u2019s perspective, space stocks to buy offers incredible diversification. That\u2019s especially the case if you\u2019re young and just staring out in your investing journey. The ideas mentioned here \u2013 especially the large-capitalization plays \u2013 will probably outlive all of us. In other words, these enterprises may provide cradle-to-grave type of expansion.\n\nMost importantly from a financial perspective, space-related enterprises provide a critical impetus for economic growth. As well, the synergies that materialize may spark new markets. According to McKinsey & Company, the global space economy could be worth $1.8 trillion by 2035. Last year, the sector reached a valuation of $630 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to launch your portfolio into orbit, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Below are enticing space stocks to buy.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the giants in the aerospace and defense industry, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) might not be the most exciting idea among space stocks to buy. However, it\u2019s one of the most predictable. Lockheed offers a range of sector-related solutions, particularly in satellite development and space exploration. Also, LMT stock may benefit cynically from rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nAt the moment, Lockheed has been flat this year, gaining just under 1%. Further, analysts aren\u2019t especially enthralled with the idea, rating LMT a consensus hold. Further, the average price target sits at $486.85, which implies only about 6% upside potential. However, the most optimistic target calls for a price per share of $551. Therefore, it\u2019s worth considering among space stocks to buy.\n\nFinancially, Lockheed posted net income of $6.78 billion or $27.32 per share in the trailing 12 months (TTM). Revenue in this cycle hit $69.64 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate earnings per share of $26.27, which represents a slight dip. However, sales may rise modestly to $69.76 billion, up 3.2%. Further, revenue may bump up again in fiscal 2025 to $72.36 billion.\n\nFinally, Lockheed offers a forward dividend yield of 2.74%. It\u2019s not exciting but it keeps the boat steady.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother top-tier player within the aerospace and defense sector, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) presents a tempting but higher-risk idea. On the positive side, Northrop offers innovations regarding space systems. This includes satellite technology and space launch systems. It may also be relatively undervalued, trading at 17.36X forward earnings. For the first quarter of this year, this metric averaged 19.42X.\n\nHowever, one can also see the reason why NOC stock appears discounted. Since the start of the year, shares slipped more than 9%. Most of the volatility stemmed from the trailing month. Nevertheless, analysts appear eager to collect on the weakness. They rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $506.08 average price target, implying 19% upside potential.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Northrop posted net income of $2.16 billion or earnings of $14.35 per share. Revenue in the cycle hit $40.12 billion. Presently, its quarterly sales growth rate (year-over-year) stands at 8.9%. For fiscal 2024, experts believe that EPS may rise 6.4% to hit $24.78. On the top line, sales may expand by 4.6% to land at $41.11 billion.\n\nFurther, continued decent growth in fiscal 2025 \u2013 where EPS may reach $27.50 on sales of $43.11 billion \u2013 appears to bode well for NOC. It\u2019s one of the space stocks to buy.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nEasily the most controversial idea among the major space stocks to buy, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is risky. Sure, it commands a massive footprint in the broader aerospace arena. However, its civilian airliner business is taking a beating due to the reputational damage. A few years ago, people (rightfully) fretted about potentially dangerous anti-stall software. Now folks are worried about doors blowing off midflight.\n\nUnsurprisingly, BA stock is down more than 30%. It\u2019s ugly, no doubt about it. However, if we divorce the company from its ongoing troubles, Boeing does command incredible acumen in spacecraft and satellite systems. It\u2019s also relatively undervalued. Right now, shares trade at 1.39X trailing-year sales. During Q4 2023, this metric stood at 2.08X.\n\nNow, during the TTM period, Boeing suffered a net loss of $2.15 billion or $3.53 per share in the red. Revenue in the period reached $76.44 billion. However, the quarterly revenue growth rate slipped to 7.5% below parity.\n\nFiscal 2024 may see a massive erosion in EPS and only modest growth in sales. However, analysts project a 20% expansion in revenue to $94.51 billion in fiscal 2025. Could investors and customers forgive Boeing by then? It\u2019s possible.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s get into the real spicy stuff for space stocks to buy, beginning with Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB). Based in Long Beach, California, Rocket Lab offers specialties regarding small satellite launch services and space systems. It\u2019s been generating significant momentum in the news cycle over the past several months. After plunging from its market debut, RKLB stock is attempting to break out of a long-term horizontal trend line.\n\nIn the trailing month, shares have gained almost 12% so we may getting there. Plus, RKLB stock is still trading at a relative discount. Currently, shares trade hands at 8.43X trailing-year revenue. That\u2019s pricey relative to the underlying aerospace and defense sector. However, the multiple run up to an average reading of 11.19X in Q4 2023.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Rocket Lab incurred a net loss of $181.21 million but generated revenue of $282.46 million. Its present quarterly revenue growth rate stands at 69%. For fiscal 2024, sales may rise 74.3% to hit $426.23 million. Further, the blue-sky target calls for $447.27 million.\n\nBy fiscal 2025, the top line could expand robustly to $588.89 million. And here, the high-side estimate calls for $690.1 million. It\u2019s risky but oh so tempting.\n\nSpire Global (SPIR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US data analytics company Spire Global Inc. (SPIR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, Spire Global (NYSE:SPIR) might not seem like the most promising idea among space stocks to buy. With a market cap of under $269 million, SPIR stock is tiny. It can go either way. So far, though, that direction has been pointed northward. A space-to-cloud data and analytics firm, Spire specializes in the tracking of global data sets powered by nanosatellites.\n\nWith so many launches scheduled to take place over the next few years, Spire could see explosive demand. That\u2019s probably the reason why analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy. Further, the average price target stands at $18, implying nearly 73% upside potential. Better yet, the high-side estimate calls for $20 per share, which projects over 92% growth.\n\nIn the TTM period, Spire incurred a net loss of $71.54 million. However, sales in the cycle reached $107.22 million. Currently, the company\u2019s quarterly sales growth rate comes in at 6.3%. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate a favorable mitigation of red ink to $1.04 (previously $3.27). Also, revenue may land at $124.81 million, up 18.1%.\n\nEnticingly, sales could also fly in the following year to $154.85 million. If you don\u2019t mind volatility risk, SPIR is one of the space stocks to buy.\n\nPlanet Labs (PL) Beautiful space view of the Earth with cloud formation\n\nSource: KeyFame / Shutterstock.com\n\nEasily another high-risk, high-reward entity among space stocks to buy, Planet Labs (NYSE:PL) presents a specialty profile in the sector. The company focuses on Earth observation and satellite imagery. It further provides data analytics services. Notably, Planet Labs offers a range of applications, from scientific (understanding how our planet is evolving) to military and defense (basically spying on our enemies).\n\nAt the moment, PL stock is priced below two bucks. This translates to a market cap of under $544 million. It\u2019s a bit better than some other speculative space stocks to buy but not by much. However, with the lowly price point comes a key advantage: relative undervaluation. Right now, shares trade at 2.32X trailing-year revenue. Back about one year ago, this metric stood at 4.91X.\n\nIn the TTM period, Planet posted a net loss of $135.36 million or 47 cents per share. However, revenue in the cycle hit $228.43 million. Its current quarterly sales growth rate clocks in at 14.7%. For the current fiscal year, analysts believe there will be a slight mitigation of losses per share to 22 cents. More importantly, revenue may rise 15.4% to hit $254.78 million.\n\nBlackSky Technology (BKSY) (RKLB stock, space stocks) satellite over the Earth\n\nSource: Andrzej Puchta / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of my favorite space stocks to buy from a narrative standpoint, BlackSky Technology (NYSE:BKSY) is a literal penny stock. At the time of writing, shares trade hands at 93 cents a pop. Further, the market cap sits at $136.23 million. That\u2019s nothing and thus, it presents wild volatility risks. Still, I appreciate the underlying business: real-time geospatial intelligence and satellite imagery.\n\nWith BlackSky, the company brings myriad applications to the table, including those covering scientific and defense/security needs. Analysts really dig the idea, which is a good part of why I\u2019m bullish on it. Experts rate BKSY stock a unanimous strong buy. Moreover, the average price target clocks in at $3.17, implying nearly 240% upside potential. Further, the high-side estimate calls for a price per share of $4.\n\nDuring the TTM period, BlackSky incurred a loss of $52.35 million or 37 cents per share. However, revenue hit $100.33 million. And its current quarterly sales growth rate stands at 31.7%. For fiscal 2024, analysts are betting that the top line could fly to $108.94 million. If so, that would imply a growth rate of 15.3%.\n\nIn the following year, sales may rise to $138.54 million, up 27.2%. With that, BKSY is one of the space stocks to buy \u2013 if you can handle it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Long-term investing is possibly among the most boring things. After identifying a quality stock, it\u2019s a matter of holding with patience. On the other hand, investing in penny and meme stocks is exciting and attracts investors. There is a high degree of speculation and quick returns are tempting. Of course, it makes sense to allocate a small portion of the portfolio to penny and meme stocks. However, sustained value can only be created by exposure to undervalued blue-chip stocks.\n\nThe whole idea of value investing is to wait for the right opportunity. Even the best blue-chip stocks go through phases of price or time correction. That\u2019s the right time to grab these stocks and hold them for the next few years. A meaningful rally from a valuation gap generally translates into the stock outperforming the index.\n\nI, therefore, believe the undervalued blue-chip stocks discussed will likely outperform the index over the next three to five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense spending touched record highs of $2.44 trillion last year. It\u2019s likely that defense spending will continue to swell with rising geopolitical tensions globally. Defense stocks are, therefore, attractive for the long term, and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is worth considering. In the last 12 months, LMT stock has remained sideways. I expect a breakout rally after an extended period of consolidation for this 2.74% dividend yield stock.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Lockheed reported a robust order backlog of $159 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. The defense company has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion for the year. Value creation will continue through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nAt the same time, Lockheed is investing in next-generation defense technology. That will support upside in orders booked in the coming years. Some of the areas of research and development include hypersonic, next-generation interceptor, spectrum dominance and directed energy.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) on a gas station roof.\n\nSource: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is another stock that has remained sideways in the last 12 months. At a forward P/E of 12, CVX stock looks attractive and offers a dividend yield of 4.25%.\n\nThe reason for the oil & gas stock remaining subdued is macroeconomic headwinds that have translated into weakness in oil prices. However, with expansionary monetary policies likely, I am bullish on oil trending higher. This is a near-term catalyst for CVX stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nI must add that Chevron is a blue chip worth holding in the core portfolio. The company has an investment-grade balance sheet and quality oil & gas assets. Further, the asset portfolio has an attractive break-even that translated into healthy cash flows.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $6.8 billion for Q1 2024. Even with subdued oil prices, the annual OCF visibility is $28 billion. If oil trades at $100 per barrel, OCF will likely be more than $40 billion. The completion of its Hess (NYSE:HES) acquisition will also support cash flow upside.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock looks attractive and undervalued after a significant correction. My view is underscored by the point that PFE stock trades at a forward P/E of 11.8. Further, the biopharmaceutical stock offers a robust dividend yield of 6.13%.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the reason for the correction in PFE stock. First, growth has decelerated on the back of lower COVID-19 vaccine sales. Further, Pfizer has been impacted by drugs going off-patent.\n\nHowever, the biopharma major has a deep pipeline of drug candidates. Currently, 113 products are in the pipeline, with 37 in phase three. As new drugs are commercialized, there is visibility for growth.\n\nI must add that Pfizer has pursued acquisitions to boost its growth visibility. In December, the company completed the acquisition of Seagen for a consideration of $43 billion. The acquisition provides significant diversification in the oncology business. Therefore, there are multiple catalysts for growth, and PFE stock is likely to be a value creator from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) longer-term growth prospects and profitability metrics justify have led analysts at Stifel to raise their price target for shares in the artificial intelligence chipmaker.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts said they are lifting their price target for Nvidia's shares to $165 from $114, which was adjusted to account for Nvidia's recent decision to carry out a ten-for-one stock split.\n\nThe increase is based on Stifel's new projections for Nvidia's stock to trade at roughly 40 times expected fiscal 2027 earnings per share of $4.10, the analysts said.\n\n\"We expect the majority of near-to-medium term opportunities will come from high performance computing, hyperscale and cloud data center, and enterprise and edge computing,\" they argued. \"While we continue to view Nvidia\u2019s exposure to Gaming, Automotive and Professional Visualization favorably, the shift from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents the company\u2019s most significant revenue and profitability growth opportunity over the next several years.\"\n\nBut they noted several risks to the updated price target, including a \"potential digestion period following several quarters of significant investment\", unforeseen tightening of U.S. trade restrictions on technology shipped to China and \"general macro[economic] events.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price rose more than 3% to $135.58 on Tuesday, pushing its market capitalization above software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company.\n\nCalifornia-based Nvidia, which designs processors that are seen as critical components of powerful AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, added a little over $110 billion to its market cap -- roughly the equivalent of the entire value of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).\n\nOnce known as a manufacturer of chips optimized for the gaming community, Nvidia has evolved over the last two years into one of the figureheads of soaring enthusiasm around the capabilities of AI. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has said Nvidia is at the heart of a new \"industrial revolution\" that could fundamentally alter the global economy.\n\nIts massive share increase -- including about a 170% skyrocketing so far this year -- has lifted broader stock markets.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. financial markets are due to be closed for the Juneteenth holiday on Wednesday, potentially limiting trading activity a day after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) leapfrogged Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler says the central bank could slash interest rates if economic conditions continue to move in the \"right direction.\"\n\n1. U.S. stock markets to close for Juneteenth holiday\n\nU.S. stock markets are set to remain shuttered for the Juneteenth holiday on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both registered fresh record high closes, boosted by a surge in Nvidia shares that pushed the market capitalization of the artificial intelligence chipmaker above software group Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company (more below).\n\nAlso aiding sentiment was softer-than-anticipated U.S. retail sales data for May, which pointed to a slackening momentum in consumer spending. Traders subsequently bolstered bets that the Federal Reserve will roll out two interest rate cuts this year despite the central bank recently signaling it only expects one.\n\n2. Nvidia becomes world's most valuable company\n\nNvidia's stock price rose more than 3% to $135.58 in the prior session, pushing its market cap to $3.34 trillion and above Microsoft's valuation of $3.31 trillion.\n\nThe California-based company, which designs processors that are seen as critical components of powerful AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, added a little over $110 billion to its market cap -- roughly the equivalent of the entire value of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).\n\nOnce known as a manufacturer of chips optimized for the gaming community worth around $300 billion, Nvidia has evolved over the last two years into one of the figureheads of soaring enthusiasm around the capabilities of AI. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has said Nvidia is at the heart of a new \"industrial revolution\" that could fundamentally alter the global economy.\n\nIts massive share increase -- including about a 170% skyrocketing so far this year -- has lifted broader stock markets. A third of the 14% jump in the S&P 500 in 2024 is solely due to Nvidia's rise.\n\n3. Kugler signals rate cut in 2024\n\nInflation in the U.S. remains too high, but if economic conditions continue to move in the \"right direction\" it will be appropriate to slash interest rates, according to Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler.\n\nIn a prepared statement on Wednesday, Kugler said that several recent signs -- including fewer markups, inflation expectations, and anecdotal evidence from businesses -- suggest that price increases are not being as frequently passed on to consumers. These trends, she added, indicate that \"on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency\" with the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's stated 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut she noted that she believes interest rates -- currently at a more than two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.50% -- are at a \"sufficiently restrictive\" level to ease economic activity and cool inflation.\n\nKugler's comments were her first since Fed officials, persuaded by stronger-than-anticipated inflation readings in the opening months of 2024, released updated rate projections last week which showed they do not expect to roll out more than one rate cut this year. In March, they had previously called for as many as three.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, New York Fed President John Williams predicted rates will come down gradually, while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said he wanted to see further evidence of abating inflation before backing a rate cut.\n\n4. Golden Goose postpones IPO\n\nItalian high-end sportswear brand Golden Goose has postponed its planned initial public offering in Milan, citing a \"significant deterioration\" in market conditions following European elections earlier this month and an upcoming snap election in France.\n\nThe group, which is owned by British private equity firm Permira, added that these trends had impacted the luxury sector in particular.\n\nGolden Goose, known for its sneakers worn by celebrities like Taylor Swift, was due to price its IPO this week. It is aiming to raise about 600 million euros at a 1.86 million euro valuation. The company noted that it would look into reviving the IPO \"in due course.\"\r\n\r\n5. Crude prices inch down\n\nCrude prices edged lower Wednesday, as an unexpected build in U.S. crude inventories raised concerns over demand.\n\nBy 03:44 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% lower at $80.52 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $85.13 a barrel.\n\nU.S. crude stocks rose by 2.26 million barrels in the week ended June 14, according data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday. Analysts had expected a 2.2 million barrel draw in crude stocks.\n\nOfficial U.S. inventories from the Energy Information Administration are due on Thursday, a day later than usual due to the U.S. holiday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. stock markets close, Nvidia reaches No.1 market cap - what's moving markets\n\nChinese automakers seek retaliatory tariffs on EU cars, state media reports\n\nEurope needs greater political stability, EY says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NOAA's Geostationary Extended Observations weather satellites to bring new\u00a0critical measurements and advanced weather forecasting capability\n\nDENVER, June 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NASA has selected Lockheed Martin [NYSE:\u00a0LMT] to develop and build the nation's next generation weather satellite constellation, Geostationary Extended Observations (GeoXO), for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Concept art of NOAA's GeoXO weather satellite consellation being developed by Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe baseline contract is for three spacecraft with options for four additional spacecraft. The total estimated value of the contract including options is $2.27 billion.\n\nThe GeoXO mission will continue and expand upon critical observations of weather provided by the Lockheed Martin-built GOES-R Series geostationary satellites to include new observations of our oceans and air pollution. GeoXO's new capabilities will deliver more accurate weather forecasting and address emerging environmental issues and challenges that threaten our economy and safety. GeoXO and the nation's weather satellites are vital infrastructure for national resilience.\n\n\"Our team is excited and ready to move forward to design and field this critical national capability,\" said Kyle Griffin, vice president and general manager of Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin. \"Our GeoXO design draws heavily from what we've learned with GOES-R spacecraft over the last 15 years, while incorporating new, digital technologies not only onboard the vehicles but in the design and development of this powerful, weather-monitoring platform of the future.\"\n\nA Deeper Look into Our Severe Weather, Shifting Climate GeoXO represents an expansion of our nation's geostationary weather satellite enterprise, its capabilities and continued U.S. technological leadership. The geostationary constellation will help NOAA provide better, more accurate information on severe weather patterns, marine ecosystems, air quality and our changing climate.\n\nWith new instruments onboard, the observatories will have a major impact including: the first geostationary observations of our coastal ecosystems that supports resilient coastal communities, near real-time hyperspectral sounding to map the state of the atmosphere, enhanced lightning observations for severe convection monitoring, and continental U.S.-wide observations of harmful pollutants in the air we breathe.\n\nA Weather Constellation for the Future The first GeoXO launch is planned for the early 2030s and will maintain and advance NOAA's critical geostationary observations through the late 2050s.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe GeoXO spacecraft is based on Lockheed Martin's modernized LM2100\u2122 satellite bus, which provides more performance and flexibility for addressing NOAA's mission needs over the coming decades. The platform features SmartSat\u2122\u00a0technology that enables new software pushes and capabilities as environmental data needs change over time.\n\nHalf a Century, 120+ Weather Spacecraft on Orbit For over 50 years, Lockheed Martin has built and launched more than 120 weather and environmental spacecraft for our government's civil and military agencies.\n\nThe revolutionary GOES-R mission provided the first lightning observations from geostationary orbit, the ability to detect remote wildland fire ignitions, and unprecedented tracking of severe weather that have proven indispensable to the nation and sets a new bar for future expectations from the public, forecasters, and researchers who depend on the geostationary weather mission.\n\nThe launch of the fourth and final spacecraft in the series, GOES-U, is scheduled for June 25, 2024 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery.

        "title": "Boeing (BA) Wins $128M Contract to Aid CH-47 Chinook Helicopter",
        "content": "The Boeing Company BA recently secured a modification contract for its CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The award has been offered by the Army contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $127.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Sep 30, 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure sustainment parts for CH-47 aircraft.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Boeing?\n\nAs nations across the globe continue to strengthen their defense structures, spending on military arms and ammunition that boast technologically advanced features continues to increase manifold. This also includes increased investments in military helicopters that play a critical role in air warfare missions.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Boeing\u2019s CH-47 Chinook is an advanced, multi-mission, tandem-rotor helicopter, proven in cargo and troop transport, search and rescue, casualty evacuation, special operations, humanitarian and disaster relief, and more. It can be equipped with extended-range fuel tanks and fitted for air-to-air refueling capability. This implies that the Chinook can fly farther than ever before.\n\nSuch remarkable features of this aircraft must have been boosting its demand, which, in turn, has prompted Boeing to provide a broad spectrum of services, from performance-based logistics contracting and integrated fleet support to vertical lift maintenance, modifications and repairs. The latest contract win bears a bright example of that.\n\nConsidering the fact that CH-47 is the heavy-lift helicopter of choice for the U.S. Army and 20 international operators, with more than 950 Chinooks deployed worldwide, we may expect Boeing to win more similar contracts involving sustainment parts supply in the near future.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nRising military conflicts, terrorism, border disputes, territory invasions and violations have forced nations to increase their defense spending toward procuring combat-proven helicopters to enhance their aerial security in recent times. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm expects the military helicopters market to witness a CAGR of more than 2.9% during the 2024-2030 period.\n\nSuch expanding market prospects should boost Boeing\u2019s growth, thanks to its established position in manufacturing combat helicopters like AH-64 Apache, MH-139 and AH-6 light attack helicopter, apart from Ch-47 Chinook.\n\nOther defense primes that are expected to reap the benefits of the military helicopter market have been discussed below.\n\nAirbus EADSY is one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced military helicopters.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Secures an Army Contract to Aid PAC-3 Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), recently clinched a contract for Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) software. The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $65.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Jun 30, 2026. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie, TX, as well as Bahrain, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nIncreasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, has been ushering in solid contract flows for major missile makers like Lockheed. The latest contract win is a testament to that.\r\n\r\nNotably Lockheed\u2019s MFC unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. In particular, its PAC-3 is an advanced defensive missile, which with its unmatched Hit-to-Kill capabilities, defends against advanced threats including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles and aircraft.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that in 2023, 15 nations chose PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. This surely reflects the solid demand that PAC-3 enjoys in the global missile market.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nSuch a solid growth prospect, offered by the aforementioned market, positions Lockheed to benefit substantially in the coming days. Notably, to further enhance the market reach of PAC-3 missiles, in May 2024, Lockheed launched a PAC-3 MSE interceptor from an MK-70 containerized launch platform to engage a cruise missile target in flight.\u00a0 This test marked the first time PAC-3 MSE was launched in this configuration, utilizing the Virtualized Aegis Weapon System to intercept a live target. Such modernization efforts in tandem with growing demand for missiles can be expected to fetch more contract wins for PAC-3 missile, thereby bolstering the top-line performance of LMT\u2019s MFC unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nThe solid growth prospect offered by the missile and missile defense systems market should also bode well for other defense contractors, as mentioned below, which are prominent missile makers, apart from LMT.\n\nRTX Corp RTX: It offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, Evolved Seasparrow Missile, Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground on a $115 million worth, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: Boeing-built and supported air and missile defense systems have been protecting the United States, its allies and international partners against threats ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to hostile aircraft, for almost 25 years. Its product portfolio includes the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, the Avenger Air Defense System, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and a few other missiles.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nShares of Lockheed have risen 2.8% in the past year against the industry's decline of 12.9%.

        "title": "3 Space Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "The space sector saw a tough 2022 due to low investor interest in high-risk sectors and high interest rates affecting borrowing costs. 2023 has already seen a recovery, and 2024 has been hot for the sector, with $6.5 billion in investments in Q1 2024, up\u00a033% from Q4 2023. Now is the time to pay attention to this industry again. The space economy, valued at $443.20 billion last year, is projected to grow to $916.85 billion by 2033, indicating robust financial health. Government and private investments are driving innovation, with $4 billion funneled into space companies in 2023 alone, a tenfold increase from a decade ago.\n\nThe three companies below enjoy being in a fast growing market, have recently secured strong contracts, and have healthy financials to back them up. Moreover, they are either affected by temporary headwinds or have unrealized growth potential which makes it a good time to snap it up right now.\n\nRocket Lab (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)was founded by former SpaceX engineers who focused the company on launching small satellites with significant cost advantages. RKLB is down over 17% YTD (year-to-date) due to a failed launch in September 2023 and postponed rocket launches\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, Rocket Lab is still a leader in the market. It has launched more rockets than other providers\u00a0second only toSpaceX. Many of its competitors have already gone bankrupt, and it\u2019s understood that space is a risky industry where failed launches are common.\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s financials are still solid. Revenue was $92.77 million in Q1 2024, up\u00a069% YOY. Losses were $44.26 million which is less than last year\u2019s $45.62 million. Cash was $365.93 million, significantly up from $162.52 million in Q3. Rocket Lab also has a current ratio of 3.1x, which is the ratio of its assets to its debt due in one year. This means that Rocket Lab is in a strong financial position to continue operating and weather any failed launches in the future.\n\nOverall, though Rocket Lab has seen some bad publicity due to a failed launch and postponed launches, its superior technology and market position combined with its solid financials makes it a future leader in space.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the aerospace and defense industry leader. Its stock has changed little since the year began and traded under $435 for the early part of 2024. The stock has been stalled due to fighter jet delays and fewer orders signed for 2025 by President Biden. However, a key opportunity for the stock lies in its space sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to its long-standing relationship with the U.S. government and numerous governmental contracts, Lockheed Martin has an\u00a018.5% market share in the space vehicle and missile manufacturing industry. In fact, it is the biggest receiver of defense contracts from the US government overall.\n\nLockheed Martin reported outperforming figures\u00a0ending the fiscal year 2023. Revenue stood at $67.57 billion, demonstrating 2.41% YoY growth. Additionally, net income rose to $6.92 billion, showing 20.73% YoY growth. Best of all, Lockheed reported a Leveraged (free cash flow) Margin of 7.39%, beating the sector by 15.4%.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s legacy product has been the\u00a0Orion Spacecraft which started in 2006. It recently used the Orion to complete the Artemis I missions in 2023, and NASA has said that the Orion is performing better than expected. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin has been able to reduce costs significantly with each iteration. Overall, Lockheed Martin has been a successful player in space and has strong ties to the US government. Its future in space and stagnating stock price could mean it\u2019s a good opportunity to buy.\n\nLeidos Holdings (LDOS) Leidos (LDOS) logo on the side of an office building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS)is a defense and aviation research company headquartered in Virginia. The company\u2019s stock is up 33.06% year to date due to major new contracts.\n\nLDOS has shown steady\u00a0gross profits over the past few quarters. Undeniable progress has been made since Quarter 1, 2023, when the gross profit was $495 million, to Q1 2024, at $638 million. Other factors, such as earnings-per-share, have also seen positive growth, with earnings-per-share growth from Q1 2023 to 2024 at 77%.\n\nRecently, the company was offered a\u00a0contract worth $738 million to support the US Air Force, including IT and telecommunications support. This is a massive win for Leidos as it supports the company financially while allowing it to form partnerships with the DoD, strengthening its position since 2003.\n\nTo conclude, Leidos\u2019s financials are robust, and its contract with the US Air Force makes it a strong space stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Lockheed Martin (LMT) standing at $459.01, reflecting a +0.15% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.77%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.49%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.95%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost 1.69% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Aerospace sector's loss of 1.9% and lagged the S&P 500's gain of 3.71% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Lockheed Martin in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is expected to report EPS of $6.45, down 4.16% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $17.03 billion, up 2.04% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $26.26 per share and a revenue of $69.72 billion, indicating changes of -5.61% and +3.18%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. As of now, Lockheed Martin holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Lockheed Martin is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.46. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 17.58 for its industry.\n\nInvestors should also note that LMT has a PEG ratio of 4.3 right now.

        "title": "With EPS Growth And More, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Makes An Interesting Case",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nHow Fast Is Lockheed Martin Growing?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Lockheed Martin managed to grow EPS by 4.0% per year, over three years. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note Lockheed Martin achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 5.2% to US$70b. That's a real positive.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Lockheed Martin's future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Lockheed Martin Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Lockheed Martin has a market capitalisation of US$110b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$63m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add Lockheed Martin To Your Watchlist?\n\nAs previously touched on, Lockheed Martin is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin that you need to be mindful of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Gives Thumbs Up to 1 Tiny Space Stock",
        "content": "Valued at $110 billion and doing nearly $70 billion in annual business, Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) is the world's biggest defense company. It's also a major player in space.\n\nLockheed Martin builds the Orion spacecraft that will one day carry NASA astronauts (back) to the moon, making it an integral part of NASA's Project Artemis. Lockheed owns half of United Launch Alliance, still the preferred provider of satellite launches to the U.S. government (despite SpaceX's best efforts). In addition to its own efforts in space, Lockheed is also a sort of incubator for the businesses of other, smaller space companies.\n\nLockheed was one of the early investors in Rocket Lab USA, for example, a space start-up I own a piece of. Through its Lockheed Martin Ventures arm, Lockheed has a stake in small rocket company ABL Space Systems, satellite company Hawkeye 360, and satellite manufacturer Terran Orbital, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It's also a customer of some of these companies. Last month, for example, Terran Orbital stated that it has contracts to build more than 100 satellites for Lockheed Martin.\n\nAnd I have a strong hunch we just figured out who's going to help launch those satellites.\n\nOne space company that Lockheed Martin doesn't own (yet)\n\nEarlier this month, we learned that Lockheed Martin has signed space start-up Firefly Aerospace to a contract to launch at least 15, and perhaps as many as 25, Alpha rockets carrying payloads for the space giant.\n\nAlpha is Firefly's first successful commercial rocket, having conducted four orbital launches already, with four more scheduled to take place later this year. As Firefly announced on June 5, the 15 firm and 10 optional launches it will conduct for Lockheed will take place between now and 2029, meaning Firefly could potentially be conducting more launches per year for this one single customer than it's ever launched before, in its history.\n\nAt one metric ton in payload capacity, Firefly's Alpha classes as a small rocket. Although three times larger than Rocket Lab's Electron, Alpha has only 4% the payload capacity of ULA's heavy lift Vulcan Centaur (half-owned by Lockheed). That makes it less than useful for launching giant payloads such as space telescopes, for example -- but perhaps perfectly sized to launch smaller satellites such as the ones Terran Orbital is producing for Lockheed.\n\nWhat it means for space investors\n\nNeither Lockheed nor Firefly have confirmed precisely that Firefly will be launching Terran Orbital satellites for Lockheed -- or indeed, said anything yet about the payloads. However, an earlier launch (FLTA004, which suffered an anomaly) attempted to place a Terran Orbital satellite into orbit for Lockheed in December 2023 -- which does seem to suggest that these rockets would be the right size and type for Lockheed to use when attempting to place future Terran Orbital satellites in orbit.\n\nStory continues\n\nAssuming I'm correct on these surmises, this means that Lockheed is serving as a sort of intermediary between Terran Orbital and Firefly, matching up subcontracted satellites with subcontracted rockets to launch them. With Lockheed Martin as the indispensable party to both subcontractors, an investor can probably safely assume that it will be earning respectable profit margins on this business. And seeing as Lockheed Martin's space division profit margins have sunk from about 10.5% to less than 9% over the past five years, that would be a positive development.\n\nAt the same time, Lockheed's patronage is obviously good news for Terran Orbital, helping keep the company afloat even as it continues losing money. (Terran reported more than $150 million in losses last year, a sum nearly equal to the company's entire market capitalization.)\n\nFor Firefly, the news is even better. Media reports indicate that Lockheed may be paying Firefly as much as $15 million per launch. At a cadence of five launches per year, that implies something on the order of $75 million in annual revenue that Firefly might get out of this contract -- nearly half its annual revenues, according to data from S&P Global. And over the course of the five-year, 25-rockets contract, Firefly could end up booking sales of $375 million.\n\nFor a young space start-up still raising cash to finance an ambitious slate of projects, from orbital space tugs to lunar landers to two brand new rocket designs, that sweet, sweet Lockheed Martin cash should come in handy -- and help tide Firefly over until it can IPO.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS recently clinched a contract to offer the U.S. Air Force enterprise information technology (IT) and telecommunications support, including cybersecurity.\u00a0 The agreement is valued at $738 million. \r\n\r\nPer the terms of the contract, Leidos will provide cybersecurity, enterprise IT operations, IT asset management, program management and engineering services to all components of the Air Force in the national capital region, including the National Military Command Center.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring LDOS?\n\nAmid escalating geopolitical tensions worldwide, cyber security threats have been posing as a major risk factor to a nation\u2019s security. The necessity for secure and dependable networks to link fighters in the air and the operating base has become crucial as countries invest more in military cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nConsequently, as defense sectors across the board are focusing more on making their data transmission more secure, defense contractors like Leidos are witnessing solid contract flows involving the strengthening of cybersecurity capabilities.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nLockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 points to a change of -5.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $17.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2%. The $69.72 billion and $72.44 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "RTX Secures a Contract to Aid Silent Knight Radar Systems",
        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently secured a contract involving its Silent Knight radar systems. The award has been provided by the U.S. Special Operations Command, MacDill Air Force, FL.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $33.7 million, the contract has a ceiling amount of $293 million and is projected to be completed by Jun 14, 2030. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will provide sustainment, support, research, development and supplemental objectives related to the Silent Knight radar systems.\n\nBy offering these aids, RTX will support the U.S. Special Operations Command Program Executive Office-Fixed Wing, Special Operations Forces Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics-KF. Work related to this deal will be carried out in McKinney, TX.\n\nRTX & Radars\n\nWith the rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions globally in recent times, nations across the globe have been significantly boosting their defense arsenal. Since radars constitute a vital part of this arsenal, escalation in defense spending has been boosting investments in radars as well.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that while radars have been in use since World War II for locating threats and targets, they are being used today for multiple purposes like ground surveillance, missile control, fire control, moving target indication, weapons location and vehicle search.\n\nThis must have been ushering in solid order flow for radar manufacturing companies like RTX in the form of contract wins like the latest one. Notably, RTX\u2019s Silent Knight radar serves as a common multi-mode terrain following/terrain avoidance radar for a variety of platforms including the MH-47G helicopter, the lead aircraft for the program. It allows airborne forces safe low-level flight and safe ingress and egress in adverse environments. The system also provides navigation support, ground mapping and weather information to aircrews.\n\nRTX\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nThe demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like the rise in defense spending of emerging economies, increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft.\n\nThis has set the stage for ample growth opportunities for the military radar market and must have prompted the Markets and Markets firm to project a CAGR of 4.7% during 2023-2027 for the global military radar market. Such growth projections bode well for prominent radar manufacturers like RTX.\n\nImpressively, RTX\u2019s product portfolio consists of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars as well as air dominance radars. Radars like AN-TPY-2, APG-79 and APG-82 are some of the company\u2019s combat-proven products that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market, apart from AN/SPY-6.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nRTX apart, other defense contractors that are major radar manufacturers and thus expected to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the global military radar market are discussed below:\r\n\r\n Lockheed Martin LMT: Its radars are the choice of more than 45 nations on six continents. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes various radar systems like AN/APY-9 radar, airborne ground surveillance radar systems, AN/TPQ-53 radar systems, SPY-7, the long-range discrimination radar, FPS-117 and a few more.\n\nLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.10%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nL3Harris Technologies LHX: The company manufactures combat-proven radars like SPS-48, land-based surveillance radar, AN/APY-11 Multimode radar, Tactical Air Surveillance radar, AN/SPS-48G Long range 3D surveillance radar and many more.\u00a0 Notably, its Vigilant family of software-defined, radar electronic support measures solutions is essential for survival and dominance in the electromagnetic threat environment of the modern battlefield.\n\nL3Harris boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 9.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: As a pioneer in Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, NOC has been at the forefront of AESA innovations for more than 60 years. Its diverse product portfolio includes a handful of other radars like the F-35 fire control radar and the Distributed Aperture System, the LONGBOW Fire Control Radar, the Scalable Agile Beam Radar, the APR-39 DV (2), the EV(2) Radar Warning Receiver programs and a few more.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe company\u2019s shares have risen 11.4% in the past year against the industry\u2019s decline of 10.1%.

        "title": "The 3 Best Aviation Stocks to Buy (Sorry, Boeing.)",
        "content": "Fortune discussed the best aviation stocks in early June, suggesting that even though they\u2019re a bargain, they might not be worth the turbulence.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock has taken it on the chin in 2024. It\u2019s down more than 27% with a half-year left to plummet some more. Is it a bargain?\n\n\u201cNicolas Owens, an industrials equities analyst at Morningstar, notes that the spectacular nature of aviation mishaps can produce overreaction on the part of investors,\u201d Fortune contributor Jeff John Roberts wrote on June 3.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (BATS:ITA), which has Boeing as its second-highest weighted stock holding at 14.14%, is actually up more than 7% in 2024, which suggests you might be better off buying ITA to capture the undervaluation in aviation stocks.\n\nHowever, this is an article about stocks, so stocks it will be.\n\nThe ITA\u2019s average price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios are 3.85x and 31.61x, respectively. I will look for names held by ITA that have a product of less than 122.\n\nTextron (TXT) Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey shown during a flight demo.\n\nSource: Angel DiBilio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to Morningstar.com, Textron (NYSE:TXT) has a P/E and P/S of 14.86x and 1.23x, respectively. It is the eighth-largest holding of ITA with a 4.03% weighting. Its shares are up over 6% year-to-date.\n\nTextron isn\u2019t a direct competitor to Boeing like GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) but it does have several aviation-based businesses including Bell Helicopters and business jets under the Citation, Cessna, and Beechcraft brands.\n\nAs a golfer, I\u2019ve always followed it because of its E-Z-Go, Cushman, and Arctic Cat brands. They\u2019re more consumer focused businesses with solid commercial revenue as well. However, it is the aviation business that drives the company\u2019s share price, accounting for more than 62% of its 2023 revenue.\n\nIn Q1 2024, its segment profit was $290 million, 12% higher than Q1 2023. Its aviation-related segment profit contributed all of the growth, offset by lower Industrial segment profits and losses from Textron eAviation, the company\u2019s electrification unit.\n\nOut of the 18 analysts that cover its stock, 11 rate it a Buy, with a $100 target, 17% higher than its current share price.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has a P/E and P/S of 16.69x and 1.65x, respectively. It is the third-largest holding of ITA with a 12.83% weighting. Its shares are up about 1% year-to-date.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s products keep America\u2019s military prepared to defend the country. Products from the Maryland-based defense contractor include the F-35 joint strike jet fighters, Blackhawk combat helicopters, Hellfire missiles and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarron\u2019s reported comments from Seaport Research Partners analyst Richard Safran from earlier in June that its supply chain issues are going away, providing a higher multiple for the company\u2019s shares.\n\nFurther, while its earnings per share have tripled in the past 10 years compared to a two-fold increase for the S&P 500, its shares have traded at a discount to the index\u2019s 12-month forward earnings.\n\nThe biggest risk for Lockheed is that it generates 75% of its revenue from the U.S. government. Should Congress take a hatchet to defense budgets post-election, that would hurt future revenue.\n\nAs of March 31, it had a backlog of $159 billion, or about 2.3x its 2023 revenue, which means it\u2019s got plenty to keep it busy well beyond November.\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX) has a P/E and P/S of 20.68x and 2.11x, respectively. It is the largest holding of ITA with an 18.85% weighting. Its shares are up more than 25% year-to-date, nearly double the index.\n\nInvestorPlace contributor Rich DuPrey recently included RTX in a group of three stocks to buy over $100. RTX just makes the cut at $106.64 as I write this. DuPrey\u2019s rationale for buying shares of the company best-known for its Patriot missile system and Stinger and Javelin missles, is that it\u2019s operating in the best business environment in its history with record backlog of $202 billion.\n\nYou know what they say, \u201cYou have to make hay while the sun shines.\u201d RTX is doing that.\n\nThe company has three operating segments: Collins Aerospace, Raytheon, and Pratt & Whitney. The latter\u2019s Q1 2024 sales were 23% higher year-0ver-year to $6.46 billion, generating $430 million in operating profits. Of the three segments that generated nearly the same revenue in the first quarter, Pratt & Whitney has the lowest operating margin of 6.7%.\n\nLike Lockheed Martin, analysts are on the fence about RTX stock. Of the 25 that cover it, only nine rate it a Buy, with a $109.50 target price, 3% higher than its current share price.\n\nOf the three, Textron is my favorite.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nWill Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

He particularly enjoys creating model portfolios that stand the test of time.

        "title": "RTX Wins Contract to Support Rolling Airframe Missile Program",
        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently clinched a modification contract involving the supply of spare parts for its Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $33.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2027. Per the terms of the deal, RTX is going to provide Mod 5 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) requirements and spares for its RAM program.\n\nA major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Ottobrunn, Germany. The contract will serve the U.S. Navy and German government.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nIncreasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation\u2019s defense strategy. With the United States being the world\u2019s largest weapon supplier and RTX a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations provides the company with solid order flows. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\r\n\r\nNotably, RTX\u2019s RAM-guided missile weapon system is the world's most modern ship self-defense weapon, designed to provide exceptional protection for ships of all sizes.\u00a0 RAM missiles are deployed via the MK49 RAM GMLS and the MK15 Mod 32 SeaRAM Close-In Weapon System on more than 100 ships, ranging from fast patrol boats to aircraft carriers.\r\n\r\nRAM is currently deployed on more than 165 ships in 11 countries, ranging from 500-ton fast-attack crafts to 95,000-ton aircraft carriers. Moreover, the RAM weapon system is a cooperative program between the U.S. and German governments with industry support from RTX and RAMSYS of Germany.\n\nThe aforementioned discussion reflects the solid demand that RTX\u2019s RAM enjoys in the missile defense space, both in the United States and abroad. Considering this, we may expect RTX to win more contracts involving its RAM, like the latest one. This, in turn, is expected to bolster RTX\u2019s revenues in the coming quarters.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the global missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch growth projections should bode well for RTX, which is one of the primary missile makers across the globe. Its varied missile portfolio includes Standard Missile (SM)-2, SM-6, Tomahawk Missile, AMRAAM Missile and a few more missiles. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground on a $115 million, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024. This expansion should increase the factory's space for integrating and delivering on critical defense programs by more than 50%.\n\nThis facility expansion can be expected to enable RTX to expand its footprint further in the missile and missile defense systems market through an increased missile production rate.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nRTX apart, other defense contractors that are expected to benefit from the missile and missile defense systems market\u2019s growth are discussed below:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nLockheed Martin LMT: Lockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products are the PAC-3 missile and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile.\n\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lockheed\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: General Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.\n\nGD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics\u2019 2024 sales indicates growth of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, RTX\u2019s shares have rallied 13.2% against the industry\u2019s 9.8% decline.

        "content": "Stocks in the space sector offer exciting diversity. Tech is one of the most essential parts of the space industry, and the drive to explore the cosmos and discover pushes innovation in tech to new heights. As our technology develops, we will unlock the full potential of space little by little, and it could eventually grow into one of the largest markets ever.\n\nThose looking to get into space stocks have to be able to stomach some risk. There is little room for error in the development of tech in space and lots of room for expensive research and development. However, if you can tolerate the risk, these three stocks are perfect options for investors, given their incredible potential and lucrative positions within the space market.\n\nLet\u2019s learn more about what each company offers and why it is in an exciting position to take off in the coming years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense tech company worldwide. Its main customers include the Pentagon and other government agencies. However, Lockheed also has a significant position in the space market, supplying satellite, missile and launch tech to customers like NASA.\n\nLockheed\u2019s launch business is fueled by a massive partnership with Boeing (NYSE:BA) that started in 2006. The duo is seeing an enormous surge in demand from its government benefactors like the Air Force to launch more satellites to keep up with major competitor SpaceX and allow the government to test its latest defense tech accurately.\n\nDemand is not limited to the company\u2019s launch tech, though. The company has a long history of developing state-of-the-art missile technology. The U.S. Army is also throwing money at Lockheed to acquire its most advanced missile system, the Hypersonic Weapon System. This tech landed Lockheed a contract for $756 Million just last month.\n\nLockheed has continuously worked to expand these successful segments, as space tech accounted for 19% of net sales and missiles around 17% in Q1. With more investments from government agencies and continued success from its commercial customers, Lockheed is set to do great things. It is an excellent investment for those looking to enter space this year.\n\nLeidos Holdings (LDOS) Leidos (LDOS) logo on the side of an office building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS) is unique in the space market because, in addition to tech, it provides an extensive list of consulting services. Its main customers are NASA and other government agencies heavily involved in space.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeidos\u2019s offerings span a wide range of markets, but its space services include tech; education; and accompaniment for cargo, human exploration, and payload transportation missions. The company has a long history of working with NASA and is the leading tech services provider on their countless continued missions.\n\nThe company has also made intelligent investments to expand its space capabilities, including acquiring Dynetics, a leading research and security solutions company, in 2020. Dynetics now operates as a subsidiary of Leidos and continues to provide the most cutting-edge technology to the government.\n\nLeidos is a relatively stable stock within the space sector. It has already shown extensive growth this year, reaching an all-time high in price. Investors should keep an eye on Leidos as it continues to prove its undeniable worth and return potential.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) is not as established as the other companies on this list as it is much newer to the space tech market. While the market already involves high risk, Rocket Lab offers the risk of being a newer company without as many established customers as well.\n\nHowever, much is to be said about this launch and rocket tech specialist. The company already has a solid base in small-scale launches and is looking to expand its offerings to larger-scale rockets and satellites.\n\nIt is important to note that a small scale does not mean a small profit. In April, the U.S. space force offered Rocket Lab a $14.49 million task order to launch a small-scale electron mission. Rocket Lab does not stop at launch technology, either.\n\nOn June 11th, Rocket Lab announced that it was on its way to completing a non-binding agreement to receive $23.9M in direct funding to increase the production of its semiconductors, which are used on satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nThe funding is under the CHIPS and Science Act, and Rocket Lab was selected for the grant thanks to its acquisition of semiconductor manufacturer SolAero Technologies Inc. in 2022. This young space stock is nowhere near its peak but is primed with the potential to have a massive imprint on the space industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) Trading At A 28% Discount?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Lockheed Martin fair value estimate is US$647 Lockheed Martin's US$463 share price signals that it might be 28% undervalued Analyst price target for LMT is US$489 which is 24% below our fair value estimate\n\nDoes the June share price for Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.21b US$6.13b US$6.38b US$7.06b US$7.16b US$7.27b US$7.40b US$7.54b US$7.70b US$7.87b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x9 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.55% Est @ 1.80% Est @ 1.97% Est @ 2.09% Est @ 2.18% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5%  US$5.8k US$5.4k US$5.3k US$5.5k US$5.2k US$5.0k US$4.8k US$4.6k US$4.4k US$4.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$50b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.9b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (6.5%\u2013 2.4%) = US$197b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$197b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$105b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$155b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$463, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.890. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "content": "RTX Corp.\u2019s RTX business unit, Missiles and Defense, recently clinched a modification deal involving the AN/SPY-6(V) family of radars. The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $677.7 million, the contract is estimated to be completed by September 2028. The latest modification should enable RTX to exercise options for hardware production of the AN/SPY-6(V) family of radars.\n\nA major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Andover, MA.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nWith the rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions globally in recent times, nations across the board have been significantly boosting their defense arsenal. Since radars constitute a vital part of this arsenal, escalation in defense spending has been benefiting radar manufacturing companies like RTX, in the form of solid order flows for radar production and associated upgrades. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that RTX\u2019s SPY-6 is the U.S. Navy family of radars that performs air and missile defense on seven classes of ships.\n\nThese radars can defend against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, hostile aircraft and surface ships simultaneously. The solid demand for this product can be gauged from the fact that SPY-6 radar arrays are being integrated into the U.S. Navy\u2019s newest ships, including DDG 51 Flight III destroyers, frigates, aircraft carriers and amphibious warships.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like the rise in defense spending of emerging economies, increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft. This has set the stage for ample growth opportunities for the military radar market.\n\nThe Markets and Markets firm projects the global military radar market to witness a CAGR of 4.7% during 2023-2027. Such growth projections bode well for prominent radar manufacturers like RTX.\n\nNotably, RTX\u2019s product portfolio consists of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars as well as air dominance radars. Radars like AN-TPY-2, APG-79 and APG-82 are some of the company\u2019s combat-proven products that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market, apart from AN/SPY-6.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nRTX apart, other defense contractors that are major radar manufacturers and thus expected to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the global military radar market are discussed below:\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin LMT: Its radars are the choice of more than 45 nations on six continents. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes various radar systems like AN/APY-9 radar, airborne ground surveillance radar systems, AN/TPQ-53 radar systems, SPY-7, the long-range discrimination radar, FPS-117 and a few more.\n\nLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.10%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nL3Harris Technologies LHX: The company manufactures combat-proven radars like SPS-48, land-based surveillance radar, AN/APY-11 Multimode radar, Tactical Air Surveillance radar, AN/SPS-48G Long range 3D surveillance radar and many more.\u00a0 Notably, its Vigilant family of software-defined, radar electronic support measures solutions is essential for survival and dominance in the electromagnetic threat environment of the modern battlefield.\n\nL3Harris boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 9.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: As a pioneer in Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, NOC has been at the forefront of AESA innovations for more than 60 years. Its broad portfolio of products also includes radars like AN/APG-83 scalable agile beam radar, AN/ASQ-236 Dragon\u2019s eye radar pod as well as AN/APG-81 and AN/APG-71 for F-35 and F-22 jets, respectively.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe company\u2019s shares have risen 10.7% in the past year against the industry\u2019s decline of 9.5%.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Secures a Contract to Support F-35 Jet Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT Aeronautics business segment recently secured a contract to procure aircraft armament equipment for its F-35 fighter jets. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $97 million, the contract is projected to be completed by February 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure aircraft armament equipment like internal adapters and weapon umbilical cables required to employ long-range strike weapons. This procurement will allow for internal carriage and employment of the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile \u2013 Extended Range weapon for LMT\u2019s F-35 Lightning II aircraft.\n\nThe contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Foreign Military Sales customers, and non-U.S. Department of Defense program participants. Work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.\n\nSignificance of F-35 Jets\n\nLockheed\u2019s F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter jet in the world. It can securely connect high-tech platforms to share information across every domain, air, land, sea, space and cyber. The aircraft comes in three main variants, which are F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing), F-35B (short take-off and vertical landing) and F-35C (carrier-based).\n\nSuch remarkable features of this fighter jet are likely to have been bolstering the demand for the F-35 aircraft. F-35\u2019s solid demand can be further gauged from the fact that Lockheed has delivered 992 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 373 jets in the backlog as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets in 2024 and 156 in 2025 and beyond. This, along with the latest contract win, can be expected to significantly boost Lockheed\u2019s revenue growth in the coming quarters, considering the fact that F-35 jet program generated approximately 25% of the company\u2019s total consolidated net sales in first-quarter 2024.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nAmid the geopolitical tensions prevalent across the globe, nations are rapidly augmenting defense purchases to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to an increased demand for fighter jets, which form an integral part of a country\u2019s defense products. Per a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global military aviation market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.23% during 2024-2030.\n\nSuch projections indicate immense growth opportunities for prominent combat jet manufacturers like Lockheed. Its Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. The company\u2019s fighter jet portfolio includes C-130 Super Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and F-16 Fighting Falcon, in addition to F-35 jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nOther defense players that are expected to gain from the expanding global military aviation market are discussed below:\n\nAirbus EADSY: Its military aircraft consists of the A400M, C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. The company delivered a total of 1,783 military aircraft as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\nEADSY boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 21.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 8.2% from the top line reported in 2023.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: Its product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more. In 2023, Boeing delivered 22 F/A-18s, nine F-15s, three T-7A Red Hawks and 11 P-8 models.\n\nBA has a long-term earnings growth rate of 27.5%. The consensus estimate for Boeing\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.1% from the top line reported in 2023.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It has built some of the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. The significant awards won by NOC in 2023 included $1.7 billion for E-2 and $1.5 billion for Triton jets.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the top line reported in 2023.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of LMT have risen 4.5% against the industry\u2019s 9.5% decline.

        "content": "As we venture into June 2024, the space industry continues to capture the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike. With the global space economy projected to triple to $1 trillion by 2040, the potential for growth is immense. Innovation in this sector is also expected to grow. In this article, we will delve into three of the best space stocks that are making waves in the industry.\r\n\r\nEach of these companies brings a unique perspective and approach to the space sector, from established aerospace giants to emerging players pushing the boundaries of space exploration and commercialization. We will examine their financial performance, strategic initiatives, and future prospects, providing valuable insights for investors seeking to capitalize on the exciting opportunities in the space industry.\n\nSo here are three of the best space stocks to buy in June. These stocks may not stay cheap for long, so taking urgent action is advisable for investors interested in this industry.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) remains a compelling buy in June 2024, despite recent turbulence in its stock price.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s Space segment, which saw a 10% increase in sales to $3.27 billion in Q1 2024, focuses on satellites, space probes, and deep space exploration\u200b\u200b. Lockheed Martin is a key contractor for NASA, contributing to missions like the Artemis program.\r\n\r\nThe aerospace giant reported robust financial performance with net sales of $17.2 billion. This translates to an EPS of $27.31 year-to-date. The company boasts a profit margin of 9.73% and an impressive return on equity of 83.2%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s strategic focus on high-growth sectors is evident in its $4.1 billion contract with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency for hypersonic threat tracking. Furthermore, its aeronautics unit saw significant gains, largely due to the F-35 program, contributing to a $735 million increase in sales.\n\nLockheed projects sustained production rates and a positive revenue trajectory, with a forecasted increase to $78.61 billion by 2028. Analysts have set a target price of $489.10, signaling strong upside potential for LMT.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) is an emerging player in the space sector. It is tapping into the global space economy\u2019s potential growth, which is projected to triple to $1 trillion by 2040.\n\nDespite financial challenges, Rocket Lab\u2019s strategic position makes it a compelling space stock in June 2024. The company reported Q1 2024 revenue of $93 million, although it currently has an EPS of -$0.37\u200b.\n\nStory continues\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s recent $515 million U.S. government contract for designing and operating space vehicles is something to note. The contract involves designing, manufacturing, delivering, and operating 18 space vehicles, with a base amount of $489 million and potential incentives of $26 million. The company has successfully launched 42 Electron rockets and continues to demonstrate technological advancements\u200b.\r\n\r\nWith an analyst target price of $7.57 and a 52-week high of $8.05, Rocket Lab offers upside for growth-oriented investors\u200b.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), headquartered in Las Cruces, New Mexico, is an aerospace company focused on developing manned spaceflight for private individuals and researchers.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the company reported a loss of 25 cents per share and revenue came in at 2 million. With a market capitalization of $347.9 million and shares outstanding totaling 411.4 million, SPCE faces financial challenges, reflected in its negative EPS of -$1.17.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s efforts, including plans to produce larger Delta-class ships and price tickets at $450,000 per seat, profitability remains elusive. The decision to raise $400 million through a common stock sale caused an 18% share price drop, underlining investor concerns.\n\nWith a price to sales ratio of 63.54 and a book value of $1.03, Virgin Galactic\u2019s high volatility and uncertain financial trajectory pose substantial risks, necessitating careful consideration for potential investors.\n\nStill, despite these concerns, SPCE could be one of the best pure-play space stocks for investors to consider adding to their portfolios thanks to its tiny valuation at just 85 cents per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed the most recent trading day at $467.46, moving -0.57% from the previous trading session. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.26%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.18%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.35%.\n\nThe aerospace and defense company's stock has climbed by 0.27% in the past month, falling short of the Aerospace sector's gain of 1.95% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.25%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Lockheed Martin in its upcoming release. On that day, Lockheed Martin is projected to report earnings of $6.45 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 4.16%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $17.03 billion, indicating a 2.04% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nLMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $26.26 per share and revenue of $69.72 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -5.61% and +3.18%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.18% higher. Right now, Lockheed Martin possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Lockheed Martin is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.91. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.06.\n\nIt's also important to note that LMT currently trades at a PEG ratio of 4.41. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Aerospace - Defense industry stood at 1.79 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 141, positioning it in the bottom 45% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "title": "Northrop (NOC) Wins $119M Contract to Aid E-2 Hawkeye Jet Program",
        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s NOC, business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a contract involving its E-2 Hawkeye aircraft. The award has been provided by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $119.6 million, the contract is estimated to be completed by December 2025. Per terms of the deal, Northrop will provide long-term, requirements contract for the repair of 17 weapon replaceable assemblies and shop replaceable assemblies to support the E-2 Hawkeye jets.\n\nMajority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Syracuse, NY.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Northrop?\n\nOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. With combat aircraft constituting a major portion of this portfolio, prominent defense aircraft manufacturers like Northrop witness a solid inflow of orders. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Northrop\u2019s all-weather E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning and battle management (AEW&BM) aircraft has been serving as the \"eyes\" of the U.S. Navy fleet for more than 30 years. The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is the next-generation aircraft in this family of jets, which comes with a two-generation leap in radar sensor capability and a robust network-enabled capability.\n\nOn the other hand, the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 variant possesses the most advanced AEW&BM capabilities in service today. It is the fifth-generation production E-2C Hawkeye and incorporates significant enhancements in data management, connectivity, and situational awareness to support the Navy's evolving Theater Air and Missile Defense mission.\n\nSuch features of the E-2 Hawkeye family of jets make it an attractive choice for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. Such orders are likely to boost Northrop\u2019s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.\n\nNOC\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nFactors like increasing defense spending by developed nations, rising defense investment from emerging economies, rapidly rising geopolitical tensions worldwide like the ongoing hostility in the Middle East and solid development in technological advancement of lethal aircraft have been bolstering the growth prospects of the combat jet market.\n\nThis must have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to project a CAGR of 5.2% for the global military aviation market over the 2024-2030 period. Such growth prospects should benefit Northrop as its product portfolio offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aviation market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, NOC\u2019s Aeronautics Systems is a leader in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of military aircraft systems for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, other U.S. government agencies, and international customers. Its major products include strategic long-range strike aircraft; tactical fighter and air dominance aircraft; airborne battle management and command and control systems; and unmanned autonomous aircraft systems, including high-altitude long-endurance strategic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and vertical take-off and landing tactical ISR systems.\n\nApart from E-2D, Northrop\u2019s product portfolio includes many other combat-proven aircraft like the RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which provides high-resolution imagery of land masses for theater awareness and strategic ISR to the U.S. Air Force, Japan and the Republic of Korea. On the other hand, its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber aircraft is a key component of the United States\u2019 long-range strike arsenal and one of the most survivable aircraft in the world.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nThe abounding growth prospects of the military aviation market should also benefit other defense majors that manufacture combat jets, such as Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs are the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet, the C-130 Hercules airlifter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and the F-22 Raptor jet.\n\nLMT\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 4.1%. Shares of LMT have returned 5.1% to its investors in the past year.\n\nBoeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for strike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift, including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft and commercial derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft. Its primary products include fixed-wing military aircraft, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.\n\nBoeing\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 27.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates growth of 2.1% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nTextron\u2019s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron\u2019s renowned products are the Beechcraft T-6C trainer and the AT-6 Wolverine.\n\nThe company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates growth of 5.6% from the previous year\u2019s reported number.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Northrop have lost 1.4% compared with the industry\u2019s 9.5% decline.

        "title": "The Country with the Strongest Army in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the country with the strongest army in the world. We recently released a list of the most powerful ground troops in the world, to view the full free list, head over to the Top 20 Countries with the Strongest Armies in the World.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), an estimated $2.44 trillion were spent on military expenditure across the world in 2023, a record-high, with a 6.8% increase compared to the previous year. This was the ninth successive year during which global military spending had risen, and the steepest rise in expenditure since 2009.\n\nThe United States spent $916 billion during the year, which accounted for 37.5% of all global military spending, and represented 68% of NATO\u2019s overall defense expenditure in 2023. The amount was 2.3% more than what Washington incurred in 2022. Europe spent $588 billion on defense, which was equivalent to one-fourths, or 24%, or the world\u2019s defense spending. The figure rose 16% from last year, and was 64% higher than a decade ago in 2014.\n\nOn the other hand, countries in Asia spent $560 billion on defense, which was 40% higher than in 2014. The major chunk of this expenditure came from South Asia and East Asia, whereas countries in the Middle East \u2013 especially members of the GCC \u2013 also spent hefty amounts of their GDP on defense during the year.\n\nThe surge in defense spending has resulted in a booming defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stock price has spiked 29% since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The company posted $67.6 billion in revenue in 2023, which represented a 2.4% increase from 2022. Its net earnings also significantly rose from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $6.9 billion in 2023, which helped Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) to climb from $21.66 to $27.55 per share.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, however, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported its EPS at $6.39, which beat expectations but was 3.3% lower year-on-year. This is likely to have happened due to its cost overruns while being part of several ongoing classified military programs. On the whole, the company\u2019s financial position remains solid, and is set to profit further during 2024, especially after Washington in late April announced fresh military aid worth $61 billion for Ukraine and $26 billion for Israel.\n\nAnother company that has consistently been beating earnings estimates is Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), which in Q1 2024 posted an EPS of $6.32 per share, surpassing Zacks\u2019 estimate of $5.83 by 8.40%. This was the fourth straight quarter in which Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) had gone past analyst estimates. 2023 remained a stellar year for the company, in which it generated $39.3 billion in revenue. Seeing a sustained demand for its weapons, especially in Europe, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has projected its sales at $41.3 billion for 2024, which is 4.3% higher than last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers are soaring as well, having generated $68.9 billion of revenue in 2023 \u2013 nearly three-fifths of which came from defense-related sales. Since the start of the Ukraine war, the company has received orders worth $3 billion for its AMRAAM rockets which have been pivotal in pushing back advancing Russian forces. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has also been providing essential military supplies to other countries in the region, including Germany, which in March last year, entered into a $1.2 billion deal with the company to develop Patriot air and missile defense systems. Later in November of the same year, Hungary received the first two units of the NASAMS air defense system it ordered from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace. The Country with the Strongest Army in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered several weighted metrics to list the top 20 countries with the strongest armies in the world. These include GDP (10%), defense spending (10%), manpower (10%), battle tanks (10%), armored fighting vehicles (5%), self-propelled artillery (5%), towed artillery (5%), rocket projectors (5%), attack helicopters (15%), nuclear weapons (15%), and technological capabilities (10%).\n\nWe observed where countries ranked on each metric, and then multiplied their ranking with the weight for that metric. That gave us a weighted ranking for that country on a particular metric. For example, if a country ranked 1st on a metric weighed at 10%, it received a weighted ranking score of 0.1 (1x10%). This was done for all metrics considered in our research. Finally, all weighted ranking scores were aggregated to get an overall weighted ranking.\n\nData related to GDP, manpower, and battle tanks was sourced from the Top 25 Powerful Countries in the World by Military Strength, while Artillery Strength by Country: Top 20 Militaries was consulted for figures related to self-propelled artillery, towed artillery, and rocket projectors. 15 Militaries with the Most Armored Fighting Vehicles in the World was referred for armored vehicles\u2019 fleet size, and 15 Countries with the Most Attack Helicopters in the World for the number of attack helicopters for each country in the list.\n\nFresh numbers related to defense spending in 2023 were obtained from SIPRI, whereas Power Atlas was used for information on the nuclear arsenal of countries. Lastly, the Global Innovation Index 2023 was used to determine the technological capabilities of countries.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe country with the strongest army in the world is the United States!\n\n1. United States\n\nGDP (2023): $26.9 trillion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $916 billion\n\nManpower: 1,328,000\n\nTanks: 4,657\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 360,069\n\nSelf-propelled Artillery: 1,595\n\nTowed Artillery: 1,269\n\nRocket Projectors: 694\n\nAttack Helicopters: 1,000\n\nNuclear Weapons: 5,550\n\nTechnological Capabilities: 3/132\n\nWeighted Ranking: 2.75\n\nThe United States has the strongest army in the world. The country spent $916 billion in defense expenditure during 2023, which represented 37% of the global military spending. It is the third most technologically advanced country in the world, which reflects in its massive defense industry at home. Another significant, strategic strength of the US Army is the access it enjoys to America\u2019s military bases spread across 80 countries, which allows them to strike enemy targets anywhere at will.\n\nTo learn about other powerful armies, check out our detailed report Top 20 Countries with the Strongest Armies in the World.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from military affairs to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "Cash Flow Kings: 7 Stocks Set to Deliver Massive Value to Shareholders",
        "content": "A commonly used method to value stocks is discounted cash flow analysis. The basic idea is to estimate the present value of future cash flow from the business. While revenue growth is important, the bottom line is the cash flow potential that the business holds. Investors should look for cash-flow stocks that represent companies with robust free cash flow and the ability to increase cash flow on a sustained basis.\n\nAn important point to note is that blue-chip companies generally have robust cash flow. On the other hand, growth companies are focused on aggressive investments and cash flow is relatively low. However, if an investor can correctly identify a future cash-flow machine, returns from the stock can be multi-fold.\n\nI have discussed a mix of blue-chip and emerging ideas from the perspective of cash flow potential from the business. I must add that healthy cash flow would also imply robust dividends and sustained value creation through share repurchase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are seven cash-flow stocks worth your attention now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a valuation of almost $3 trillion is not a euphoria or a bubble. The valuation is a function of innovation and the cash flow potential. AAPL stock has a low dividend yield of 0.5%. However, I expect robust dividend growth in the next five years.\n\nApple reported operating cash flow of $62.5 billion for the first half of 2024, implying an annualized operating cash flow potential of $125 billion. Further, the technology company has a cash buffer of $160 billion.\n\nTherefore, there is ample flexibility for dividends, share repurchases, and investment in innovation-driven growth. For the first half of 2024, the products business witnessed some contraction. However, the services segment, which includes the App Store, offset that weakness.\n\nEven in the product segment, the wearable, home, and accessories businesses are likely to gain growth traction in global markets. Recently, the company unveiled a new AI-focused chip in its iPad Pro. With AI-powered enhancement in devices, I expect the products segment to deliver healthy growth in the coming quarters. Therefore, as the business grows, cash flows will continue to swell.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another technology stock that looks attractively valued, and the business is a cash flow machine. GOOG stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.5x, which is attractive considering the impending growth backed by AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q1 2024, Alphabet reported revenue growth of 15% on a year-on-year basis to $80.5 billion. It\u2019s worth noting that the Google Cloud business growth was 28% to $9.6 billion. Further, the technology giant reported operating cash flow of $23.5 billion for the quarter. The annualized operating cash flow potential is almost $100 billion.\n\nThis provides Alphabet with the flexibility to invest in AI-driven growth. At the same time, I expect a robust upside in dividends in the coming years. Coming back to AI, Alphabet is just getting started on that front. Last month, the company launched a beefed-up AI search and chatbot. Alphabet believes that it\u2019s well-positioned for the \u201cnext wave of AI innovation.\u201d I, therefore, expect healthy growth to be sustained coupled with a cash flow upside.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Lockheed Martin (LMT) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).3D illustration.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense expenditures surged to $2.44 trillion in 2023 and there is no doubt that spending will continue to swell. Defense stocks are likely to benefit on the back of a robust order intake. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is among the undervalued defense stocks to buy at a forward P/E of 17.9x. The defense stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.7%.\n\nAs of the first quarter, Lockheed Martin reported an order backlog of $159 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For 2024, the company guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion (mid-range). This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth and continued share repurchases.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that sales growth will accelerate in the coming years and will have a positive impact on cash flows. There are two reasons to expect healthy sales growth. First, Lockheed increasingly pursued deals outside the U.S. with its allies. The geographic expansion will benefit the defense major.\n\nFurther, Lockheed is focused on next-generation defense technology, including hypersonic and next-generation interceptors. Its aggressive investment in research and development is likely to be a growth catalyst.\n\nChevron (CVX)\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is an undervalued blue-chip stock from the oil and gas industry. In the last 12 months, CVX stock remained sideways with oil struggling to trend higher on the back of macroeconomic headwinds. I see the sideways move as a good opportunity to accumulate.\n\nWith multiple interest rate cuts likely in the next 12 to 18 months, I am bullish on oil. Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet and high-quality assets with an attractive break-even point.\n\nChevron reported operating cash flow of $35.6 billion for 2023 and $6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. If oil trends higher, it\u2019s likely that cash flow will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion for the year.\n\nCash flows will swell further with the likely completion of the acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES). Therefore, even with aggressive capital investment plans, there will be ample flexibility for dividend growth and share repurchase.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best pick among retail stocks considering the company\u2019s growth trajectory. While a forward P/E of 51x looks slightly stretched, COST stock has always commanded a valuation premium as compared to peers. I would look at corrections to accumulate this retail behemoth.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, Costco reported sales growth of 9.1% on a year-on-year basis to $57.39 billion. Comparable store sales growth was also healthy at 6.6%. With rate cuts impending, I expect consumption expenditures to accelerate, and Costco will benefit.\n\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the company reported operating cash flow of $8.3 billion. Cash flows have continued to swell, and I remain bullish, considering the top-line growth and continued upside in membership revenue.\n\nAs of Q1 2023, Costco had two warehouses in China. In the last quarter, the number of warehouses increased to seven. International expansion is likely to be another catalyst for growth and cash flow upside.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity stocks have been in the limelight considering the big addressable market. CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an emerging cash-flow business that deserves a place in the portfolio. CRWD stock surged by 122% in the last 12 months. There was an intermediate correction, but the reversal was swift on the back of strong Q1 results.\n\nFor the first quarter, CrowdStrike reported stellar revenue growth of 33% on a year-on-year basis to $921 million. For the same period, CrowdStrike generated operating cash flow of $383 million and ended the quarter with a cash buffer of $3.7 billion. With annual operating cash flow visibility of almost $1.6 billion, CrowdStrike is an emerging cash-flow star.\n\nThe cybersecurity company reported annual recurring revenue of $3.65 billion as of April. Over the next five to seven years, CrowdStrike is targeting an annual recurring revenue of $10 billion. This provides an indication of the headroom for upside in revenue and cash flows. It\u2019s, therefore, not surprising that CRWD stock has remained in a sharp uptrend.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nMultiple factors globally are likely to ensure that gold remains in an uptrend. Some important reasons include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the prospects of expansionary policies. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a blue-chip gold mining company worth holding for healthy dividends and capital gains.\n\nAs of 2023, Newmont reported 128 million ounces of gold reserves and 155 million ounces in resources. The gold miner has a leading portfolio of 10 Tier 1 assets. A strong asset base ensures a steady production upside beyond the current decade.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet. As of Q1 2024, the company reported a liquidity buffer of $7 billion. Last year, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. With gold trending higher, it\u2019s likely that operating cash flow will be more than $3.5 billion. This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth. At the same time, capital investments will remain aggressive backed by a strong balance sheet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "RTX Secures a Contract to Support Standard Missile Program",
        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently clinched a modification contract involving its Standard Missile program. The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $27 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2025. The latest modification enables RTX to exercise options to provide depot as well as intermediate-level repair and maintenance support for Standard Missile (\u201cSM\u201d).\n\nA major portion of the work associated with this contract will be carried out in Tucson, AZ.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like RTX, which is a prominent missile maker in the United States with a strong international presence.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that RTX\u2019s SM comes in two variants \u2014 SM-2 and SM-6. While the SM-2 missile is the world\u2019s premier surface-to-air defense weapon that defends the U.S. Navy against anti-ship missiles and aircraft, SM-6 can perform anti-air warfare, anti-surface warfare and ballistic missile defense.\n\nNotably, so far, more than 12,000 SM-2 missiles have been delivered to the U.S. and allied customers, and over 500 SM-6 missiles to the U.S. Navy. This statistic surely reflects the solid demand that these two missiles enjoy in the missile market. The latest contract win is a further testament to that. Such contract wins are expected to boost RTX\u2019s top line in the coming quarters.\n\nRTX\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nSuch a solid market growth projection stands to benefit RTX, which enjoys an extensive missile portfolio, including AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, TOW missiles and many more such weapons, apart from the Standard Missile.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nOther defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missile and missile defense market are as follows:\n\nStory continues\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: Lockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products are the PAC-3 missile and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile.\n\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lockheed\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: General Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.\n\nGD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics\u2019 2024 sales indicates growth of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of RTX have risen 12.1% against the industry\u2019s decline of 9.2%.

        "title": "With 74% ownership, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) boasts of strong institutional backing",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Lockheed Martin's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 7 shareholders own 50% of the company Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Lockheed Martin.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lockheed Martin. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Lockheed Martin's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Lockheed Martin. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 11% and 9.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that Lockheed Martin Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$64m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Defend Your Portfolio Against Economic Mayhem",
        "content": "While \u201ceconomic mayhem\u201d is far from being my base case scenario, I can envision a few events that could indeed play havoc with the U.S. economy. One problem that could trigger economic mayhem is the huge, unsustainable amount of debt that the U.S. government has accumulated. BlueBay asset manager Mark Dowling told the Economist that \u201csooner or later\u201d the debt would likely produce \u201ca big earthquake.\u201d\n\nIn another potential scenario, a massive war in the Mideast could cause oil prices to leap to $150 per barrel or more, causing the U.S. to enter a recession. And finally, a large terrorist attack against the U.S. certainly can\u2019t be ruled out, especially because many terrorists may have entered America across its southern border. Additionally, America\u2019s involvement in the Israel-Hamas War makes a terrorist attack more likely.\n\nGiven the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, along with widespread fear of Russia, China and Iran, the demand for U.S. weapons is likely to stay strong going forward no matter what happens economically. As a result, defense stocks are likely to prove fairly resilient if the economy does take a big hit. Here are three top defense names to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRTX (RTX) A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house.\n\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX) includes the defense company formerly known as Raytheon and United Technologies.\n\nThe defense contractor is clearly benefiting tremendously from geopolitical conflicts and potential conflicts around the world. For example, in Q1 the firm sold $1.2 billion of Patriot anti-air defense systems to Germany, and Ukraine ordered $282 million of Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems from it. The company also received $1.6 billion of \u00a0\u201cclassified bookings,\u201d\u00a0and announced a $301.76 million contract modification from the U.S. Navy on May 31.\n\nCEO Chris Calio noted that America\u2019s defense budget for this year is favorable for RTX, as it funds the company\u2019s key offerings. Those include \u201cnext generation propulsion, critical munitions, and upgrades to the F-135\u201d and RTX provides the engines for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The CEO indicated that RTX would also benefit from the Pentagon\u2019s spending on \u201ccounter unmanned aircraft and hypersonics.\u201d\n\nWhile a significant portion of RTX\u2019s revenue and profit are generated from commercial airlines, I expect that business to be relatively resilient to economic shocks as well, given the very long-term outlook that airlines have to adopt.\n\nKratos Defense & Security (KTOS) a group of soldiers in the desert with a drone flying over their heads\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, Kratos Defense & Security (NASDAQ:KTOS) \u201cprovides a variety of defense products, but specializes in developing extremely high tech military drones.\u201d\n\nIn the previous column, I noted Kratos appeared to have been obtaining a large number of contracts from the Pentagon. As a result, I\u2019m not surprised to see the firm reported excellent first-quarter results on May 7. Specifically, its revenue jumped 20% versus the same period a year earlier while its net income came in at $1.3 million, up from a loss of $7 million in Q1 of 2022. Also unsurprisingly, the company\u2019s drone business powered the strong showing as its unmanned systems revenue jumped 24% year-over-year to $59.4 million. Kratos expects its drone business to expand by a robust 20% in 2024.\n\nThe defense contractor has developed the Valkyrie, an AI-powered combat drone. With China and Russia investing a great deal in AI and Iran developing many drones of its own, the U.S. and its allies are likely to continue investing a great deal of money in Kratos\u2019 AI-powered, advanced drones to counter their adversaries.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130J Super Hercules of the United States Air Force performing at Aero India 2017.\n\nSource: Joe Ravi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a large, multifaceted defense contactor. Over the U.S. government\u2019s last fiscal year, the company benefited from multiple initiatives undertaken by the Pentagon, including increases in its purchases of Lockheed\u2019s F-35 fighter jets, combat rescue helicopters and C130 military transport aircraft. During the current fiscal year, the firm expects to get boosts from elevated outlays on the Sikorsky CH-53K helicopters, its space hypersonic weapon and missile defense systems, which it refers to as the Next Generation Interceptor.\n\nLast quarter, the company\u2019s top line jumped to $17.2 billion, up from $15.1 billion during the same period a year earlier. The company\u2019s earnings per share came in at $6.42, down from $6.62 in Q1 of 2023. However, easing inflationary pressures should boost the company\u2019s bottom line going forward.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in 2023 Lockheed\u2019s operating income jumped to $9.06 billion from $7.47 billion in 2022, and the shares have a rather low enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 12.4 times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin has entered a purchase agreement with Firefly Aerospace for up to 25 launches on its Alpha rocket by 2029, the U.S. defense contractor said on Wednesday.\n\nTexas-based Firefly makes small and medium launch vehicles for commercial launches to orbit. Its small-launch vehicle, Alpha, will fly Lockheed's spacecraft and payload into low-Earth orbit from its facilities on west and east coasts, Lockheed said.\n\nThe companies did not disclose the financial details of the deal. The lower-cost launch vehicles would help reduce risk for its self-funded technology demonstration missions, Lockheed said.\n\nProfit at its space division jumped in its latest quarter, benefiting from higher launch volume in United Launch Alliance, its joint venture with planemaker Boeing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoeing and Lockheed merged their rocket programs in 2006 and are looking to sell the jointly-owned venture, media reports said.\n\n(Reporting by Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)",

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Clinches a $1.9 billion Contract for HIMARS",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a modification contract for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (\u201cHIMARS\u201d). The award has been provided by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\r\nValued at $1.93 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by May 31, 2028.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nNations across the globe are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the rapidly evolving threat environment worldwide. Since missiles play a very important role in military missions, the demand for these weapons systems and their associated parts has gained solid traction in recent times. This, in turn, has resulted in a significant order inflow (like the latest one) for Lockheed, which enjoys a dominant position in the field of missile development.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT\u2019s HIMARS is the most technically advanced, affordable and sustainable artillery solution that can fire Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (\u201cGMLRS\u201d) rockets, ATACMS missiles, the next-generation Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Extended-Range GMLRS rockets. It boasts the capability to launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System family of munitions.\n\nSuch remarkable features of the HIMARS are likely to have been boosting its demand of late. This can be gauged from the fact that there are currently more than 600 HIMARS fielded systems worldwide.\n\nGrowth Prospect\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks. As the demand for missiles is on the rise, so is the demand for missile launchers like HIMARS.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the missile and missile defense systems market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nLMT\u2019s proficiency in manufacturing missiles and associated missile launchers, particularly that of HIMARS, positions it favorably to capitalize on the growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market. The fact that Lockheed remains on track to double the production of its HIMARS to 96 per year by the end of 2024, makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for this product, like the latest one.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also excels in manufacturing air-to-air missiles, helicopter-launched anti-armor missiles, kinetic energy hyper-velocity missiles, hit-to-kill air defense systems, as well as cruise missiles. Such a varied number of missiles in its product portfolio will surely fetch more notable contracts for Lockheed in the near future, thereby bolstering its revenue generation prospects.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the GMLRS propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics GD: The company\u2019s Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It is a key supplier of major strategic and tactical missile programs, ranging from warheads to missile housings to structural components to solid rocket motor cases.\n\nGD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The consensus estimate for General Dynamics\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp. RTX: RTX\u2019s business unit, Missiles and Defense, is a prominent U.S. missile maker. Its portfolio includes the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, the AIM-9X Block II missile, the RAM-guided missile weapon system, etc.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Lockheed have risen 5.1% against the industry\u2019s 7.4% decline.

Two University of Iowa Operator Performance Laboratory L-29 Delfin jets conduct simulated air-to-air intercepts using AI as part of flight demonstrations in partnership with Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. Photo by: University of Iowa\u2019s Operator Performance Laboratory\n\nThe successful flights are a significant milestone for Skunk Works' Tactical AI\u00a0team, in which AI directly flew and conducted tactical exercises with a full-scale, live aircraft \u2013 one of OPL's L-29 Delfin jets \u2013 using heading, speed and altitude commands. The team executed simulated-to-real transfer test objectives against a virtual adversary in offensive and defensive risk postures.\n\nEight test cases were conducted per flight to exercise the AI agent in a variety of situations, from standard head-to-head fights to off-aspect encounters, missile support and missile defeat scenarios. The team was encouraged to see clean sim-to-real transfer of learned behaviors and that the AI agent appeared intentional and decisive in its actions.\n\n\"This was the first live exercise of the new flight interface; it's thrilling to see the separate components successfully integrate on the L-29 to demonstrate new capabilities. The complete system performed even better in live flight than in simulation,\" said Dr. Tom \"Mach\" Schnell, OPL professor at Iowa Technology Institute.\n\n\"Live flight tests are a crucial aspect of advancing our expertise in AI and autonomy. These flights are powerful demonstrations of our ability to quickly and affordably develop and test operationally relevant AI capabilities,\" said Matthew \"Gabe\" Beard, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works autonomy/AI and machine learning engineering manager.\n\nThese flight tests are part of a broader initiative to rapidly develop and test AI-driven autonomy for air-to-air missions.

The company reported a 7% increase in revenue year over year and net bookings of $3.7 billion for Q1. With a backlog of $36.6 billion, the company has plenty of cash and leeway for continued investments in space and further expansion. Thus, it is an excellent buy for investors looking to get into space.\n\nVirgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVirgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) is leading the race for the massively popular space tourism business. The company completed its public release following a merger between famous investors Richard Branson and Chamath Palihapitiya.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this company has yet to be able to launch any passenger rockets into space, it already has a long list of reservations from wealthy individuals worldwide. Initially, the company set out to launch its first spacecraft in 2020 but could not meet its goal.\n\nHowever, this stock is so exciting because of its incredible potential once it sees lift-off. More than 700 passengers worldwide have already put their names on the waiting list. The approximate cost for each passenger is over $400,000. The potential cash flow is undeniable.\n\nVirgin Galactic recently announced plans to begin Delta-class flight service in 2026. The craft is projected to hold six passengers and complete eight monthly flights. Virgin Galactic will have a monthly revenue potential of just shy of $29 million a month.\n\nIf you can stomach some risk and have faith in its ability to make this plan a reality, now is a great time to get on board.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the most successful companies in space technology.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Lockheed Martin (LMT) reached $467.60, with a -0.58% movement compared to the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.11%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.3%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.56%.\n\nThe the stock of aerospace and defense company has risen by 1.83% in the past month, lagging the Aerospace sector's gain of 3.98% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.06%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Lockheed Martin in its upcoming earnings disclosure.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has gained 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share, indicating a change of -4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.6%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $17.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2%. The $69.72 billion and $72.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Analysis",
        "content": "Exploring the Sustainability and Growth of Lockheed Martin's Dividends\n\nLockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) recently announced a dividend of $3.15 per share, payable on 2024-06-28, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-06-03. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Lockheed Martin Corp's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.\n\nWhat Does Lockheed Martin Corp Do?\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with LMT. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nLockheed Martin is the world's largest defense contractor and has dominated the Western market for high-end fighter aircraft since it won the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in 2001. Lockheed's largest segment is aeronautics, which derives upward of two-thirds of its revenue from the F-35. Lockheed's remaining segments are rotary and mission systems, mainly encompassing the Sikorsky helicopter business; missiles and fire control, which creates missiles and missile defense systems; and space systems, which produces satellites and receives equity income from the United Launch Alliance joint venture. Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nA Glimpse at Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend History\n\nLockheed Martin Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1995. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Lockheed Martin Corp has increased its dividend each year since 2000. The stock is thus listed as a dividend achiever, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 24 years.\n\nBelow is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends. Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nBreaking Down Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Yield and Growth\n\nAs of today, Lockheed Martin Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.62% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.68%, suggesting an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.\n\nOver the past three years, Lockheed Martin Corp's annual dividend growth rate was 7.40%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 8.20% per year. And over the past decade, Lockheed Martin Corp's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 9.70%.\n\nBased on Lockheed Martin Corp's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Lockheed Martin Corp stock as of today is approximately 3.89%.\n\nStory continues Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2024-03-31, Lockheed Martin Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.44.\n\nLockheed Martin Corp's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Lockheed Martin Corp's profitability 9 out of 10 as of 2024-03-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.\n\nGrowth Metrics: The Future Outlook\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Lockheed Martin Corp's growth rank of 9 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.\n\nRevenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Lockheed Martin Corp's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Lockheed Martin Corp's revenue has increased by approximately 5.00% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 60.42% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Lockheed Martin Corp's earnings increased by approximately 4.00% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 56.25% of global competitors.\n\nLastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 6.30%, which underperforms than approximately 48.51% of global competitors.\n\nConclusion: Assessing Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Prospects\n\nConsidering Lockheed Martin Corp's consistent dividend growth, robust payout ratio, and solid profitability, the company's dividend appears sustainable in the near term. However, investors should keep an eye on the company's growth metrics, which, while solid, show some areas of underperformance compared to industry peers.

        "title": "Insiders At Lockheed Martin Sold US$9.4m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "Many Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.8m worth of shares at a price of US$428 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$470. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nInsiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Lockheed Martin. Specifically, insiders ditched US$6.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.06% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$64m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Lockheed Martin Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Lockheed Martin is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "It may seem that Cupertino-based giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fallen behind its Big Tech peers in the race for AI, as the company has only achieved a modest performance of just 3% this year compared to the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d group of leading technology companies. However, several reasons justify my bullish stance on Apple. In this article, I\u2019ll outline three of them: Apple\u2019s advancements in AI, the potential growth in China, and the company\u2019s robust fundamentals and strategic share buybacks.\n\nAI Is Finally Playing Its Game on AAPL\n\nSince last year, Apple has made some moves to catch up with its peers, but it\u00a0is\u00a0still\u00a0far from leading\u00a0the pack.\u00a0This\u00a0has sent a bearish wave through the stock, causing the Cupertino company\u2019s share price to\u00a0be stuck\u00a0in second gear.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Apple isn\u2019t making any progress on AI. The Cupertino-based company has been on a shopping spree, acquiring 32 AI start-ups in 2023\u2014more than any other tech giant, which indicates the company\u2019s efforts to expand its AI capabilities. However, as the old saying goes, \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day,\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0it seems the market is ignoring this fact, as other tech companies appear to be more advanced with their AI developments.\n\nI believe part of the market\u2019s skepticism towards Apple and its early AI efforts has\u00a0been influenced\u00a0by the launch of the VisionPro, the \u201cmagic\u201d virtual reality glasses powered by AI and machine learning. The VisionPro has received mixed reviews, with some users calling it a dud and others praising its immersive experiences. The steep $3,500 price tag hasn\u2019t helped its case,\u00a0either, making it a tough sell for the average consumer.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has faced challenges in production and demand forecasts, with reports of slashed production numbers and fading hype.\n\nIn reality, VisionPro was just Apple\u2019s first step into AI. But Apple has also been working on its\u00a0own\u00a0large language models (LLMs) and has even developed a chatbot, although it has yet to define how it will unveil it to the general public. A significant step will\u00a0be taken\u00a0when this model\u00a0is integrated\u00a0into the hardware. This integration\u00a0is expected\u00a0to begin with the launch of the AI App Store in June during its prestigious WWDC developers\u2019 conference.\n\nEventually, Apple will integrate AI and LLMs into its hardware.\u00a0There is also great anticipation\u00a0regarding Siri\u2019s on-device AI capabilities, such as real-time analysis using the iOS 18 camera.\n\nIn short, when AI\u00a0is integrated\u00a0into Apple\u2019s massive user base of two billion active iPhones, not counting other iOS devices,\u00a0it\u2019s very likely that\u00a0Apple will\u00a0be taken\u00a0more seriously regarding its AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina May be Shifting from a Headwind to a\u00a0Tailwind\n\niPhone demand in China has been a black eye for Apple\u00a0throughout\u00a0this year. The iPhone, Apple\u2019s core segment and accounting for 54% of its revenues, has exposed the company\u2019s over-dependence on a single line of business.\n\nChina is a crucial market for Apple, but local competition, especially from Huawei, has been gaining ground. A report earlier this year highlighted that Huawei has been eating into Apple\u2019s market share, leading to a 19.1% drop in iPhone sales in China during Q1. Meanwhile, Huawei\u2019s sales surged by 69.7%, driven by a significant upgrade in its new smartphone model after months of struggling to secure parts due to Western sanctions.\n\nHowever, what currently looks like a black eye could soon turn into a silver lining. Wedbush\u2019s perma-bull analyst Dan Ives suggests that while current economic data in China doesn\u2019t indicate a turnaround, a rise in upgrades could shift the narrative.\u00a0There are 225 million iPhones in China, and 70%\u00a0of these\u00a0haven\u2019t\u00a0been\u00a0upgraded\u00a0in the last three years.\u00a0Ives\u2019 theory is that many of these consumers are moving to Pro models, which boosts the average selling price (ASP) of iPhones in China.\n\nRobust Fundamentals and Share Buybacks\n\nIn addition to the two reasons mentioned above, I believe Apple\u2019s extraordinarily robust fundamentals round out the case for why Apple stock may still have significant upside potential and recover from its lackluster performance so far this year.\n\nFirst off, Apple\u2019s fundamentals remain rock solid. Even though market fears have dampened hardware demand amid unimpressive economic growth, Apple is far from a struggling company. Services have been a\u00a0major\u00a0bright spot.\n\nTake its most recent quarter, for example. Despite iPhone sales dropping 12% year-over-year and product revenues falling 10% year-over-year, services revenue jumped 14.2% year-over-year, hitting an all-time high. This growth in services helped minimize the overall 4.3% drop in net sales, allowing Apple to beat market estimates in both EPS and revenues.\n\nIn my view, since Apple operates across two main segments\u2014products and services\u2014the latter is where the company\u2019s valuation could see the most growth, especially with the potential AI adoption cycle. The high scalability of the App Store and Apple TV+ further supports this potential.\n\nMoreover, Apple\u00a0has generated\u00a0a\u00a0massive\u00a0amount of\u00a0cash\u2014$336.6 billion over the last three years.\u00a0Plus, the board recently authorized an additional $110 billion for share buybacks, an amount large enough to purchase almost all the shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), just to give you an idea.\n\nWith this move, Apple has shown a clear interest in pleasing investors\u00a0who are\u00a0anxious about its share price\u2019s underperformance this year compared to other big tech companies. As a result, AAPL stock has soared more than 11% since announcing its results, demonstrating its historic ability to bounce back from valuation declines.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street consensus on AAPL stock is largely bullish. Out of the 34 Wall Street analysts who have provided recommendations and target prices on the company in the last three months, 22 have issued a Buy rating, 11 have issued a Hold rating, and only one has issued a Sell rating. The average AAPL stock price target is $207.72, indicating upside potential of 8.1%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite fears that Apple has missed the AI bandwagon and a few other headwinds, Apple shares have underperformed compared to their big tech peers. But from my perspective, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nJune will be a key month for Apple, particularly with advances in AI, which\u00a0should\u00a0bring\u00a0a new cycle of\u00a0updates for iPhones and potentially mark\u00a0a turning point for the company.\n\nGiven Apple\u2019s\u00a0extremely solid\u00a0fundamentals\u2014evidenced by a monumental buyback announcement and significant growth in services that could be the\u00a0major\u00a0catalyst for Apple around AI\u2014I remain bullish on the stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently secured a modification contract involving the F135 propulsion system. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $301.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by June 2027. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will procure long-lead time materials as well as the manufacture, assembly, inspection, acceptance and delivery of 108 conventional takeoff and landing F135 propulsion systems. It will also procure 27 short takeoff and vertical landing F135 propulsion systems, and 13 Carrier Variant F135 propulsion systems.\n\nRTX will also help meet the global requirement for spare engines, power modules and other hardware. The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corp, non-U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) participants and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.\n\nWork related to this deal will be carried out in various locations across the United States as well as outside the continental U.S.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nAmid the geopolitical tensions prevalent across the globe, nations are rapidly augmenting defense purchases to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to an increased demand for fighter jets, which form an integral part of a country\u2019s defense products.\r\n\r\nIn this context, it is imperative to mention that F-35 jets, built by America\u2019s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena.\n\nThe soaring demand for Lockheed\u2019s F-35 aircraft can be gauged from the fact that the Czech Republic became the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team during the first quarter of 2024, making its intent to procure 24 F-35s quite obvious. In addition, the U.S. State Department approved a potential foreign military sale to Greece for up to 40 F-35 jets. Moreover, Singapore announced its intent to purchase eight F-35A jets.\r\n\r\nConsequently, RTX, being the manufacturer of the F-35 jets\u2019 engine, F135, witnesses a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, along with a handful of international partner countries as well as FMS customers. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, the production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.\n\nConsequently, we may expect Pratt & Whitney, which builds F-135, to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster RTX\u2019s top line.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Growth\n\nApart from Lockheed and RTX, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program. Northrop is part of the international partnership involved in building three variants of the F-35 jet. It is engaged in the design and production of the AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation and Identification avionics suite, which can be dynamically programmed to arm the F-35 pilot with multiple-mission capabilities, engineered for seamless transition from one mission phase to the next.\r\n\r\nNorthrop boasts a (three-to-five years) long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The consensus estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nBAE Systems BAESY: This defense major\u2019s short takeoff and vertical landing experience, along with air systems sustainment, supports F-35\u2019s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35 that includes fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.\r\n\r\nBAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 34.1% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of RTX have rallied 15.4% against the industry\u2019s 8.5% decline.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed the latest trading day at $458.48, indicating a -1.9% change from the previous session's end. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.03%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.59%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost 0.04% over the past month. This has lagged the Aerospace sector's gain of 4.27% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.19% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Lockheed Martin in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $6.45, reflecting a 4.16% decrease from the same quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $17.03 billion, up 2.04% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $26.26 per share and a revenue of $69.72 billion, signifying shifts of -5.61% and +3.18%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.24% higher. Lockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Lockheed Martin is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.8. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 18.77, which means Lockheed Martin is trading at a discount to the group.\n\nIt is also worth noting that LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.38. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Aerospace - Defense industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.79.\n\nThe Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 79, positioning it in the top 32% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Clinches Navy Contract to Support LCS Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS), recently clinched a modification contract to provide industrial post-delivery availability support for the Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship USS Cleveland (LCS 31). The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nValued at $22.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by March 2025. Work related to this deal will be executed in Marinette, WI.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nLCS is a class of small surface combatant ships, which play a critical role in defending a nation. These ships offer agile, mission-focused platforms and are capable of operating in near-shore and open-ocean environments. Currently, there are two variants of LCS in the United States. The Freedom variant is being constructed by Lockheed, which remains one of the prominent defense contractors providing combat-proven naval solutions.\n\nImpressively, the Freedom-variant LCS is a resilient, flexible warship, with more than a third of its hull being open and equipped to take on new capabilities, including advanced sensors, missiles and cutting-edge cyber systems.\n\nSuch remarkable features of this variant of LCS must have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that Lockheed is in full-rate production mode for the Freedom-variant LCS and has delivered 13 ships to the U.S. Navy, with three more in various stages of production as of April 2023.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Potential for Growth?\n\nNations across the globe are fortifying their defense spending on military weapons and arsenals as they look to strengthen their defense capabilities amid the widespread hostilities witnessed worldwide. This also includes augmented spending on navy combat vehicles, including LCS, for enhanced sea warfare capabilities.\n\nIn this regard, according to a report by the Morder Intelligence firm, the global naval combat vessels market is projected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2024-2029 period.\n\nThis obviously bolsters growth prospects for Lockheed, considering its ability to deliver versatile and cutting-edge naval solutions. Notably, apart from LCS, Lockheed\u2019s RMS unit designs Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), which is a lethal and highly maneuverable warship capable of littoral and open ocean operation. It has a range of 5,000 nautical miles and can reach a speed of more than 30 knots, with the ability to confront modern maritime and economic security threats.\r\n\r\nGiven the expertise Lockheed has in providing agile maritime securities, we may expect the company to win more contracts involving its naval solutions like the latest one, in coming days. Such contract wins should bolster the top-line performance of its RMS unit, which contributes nearly 24% to the company\u2019s total revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nConsidering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global naval combat vessels market, other defense primes like Huntington Ingalls Industries HII, Northrop Grumman NOC and General Dynamics GD, with a strong presence in this market, should benefit as well.\n\nHuntington Ingalls\u2019 Shipbuilding and Newport News Shipbuilding segments design and construct non-nuclear ships, including amphibious assault ships, expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants and national security cutters. During 2023, 81% of the company\u2019s revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy.\n\nHII boasts a long-term (three-to-five-years) earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 2% from the prior-year figure.\n\nNorthrop Grumman delivers components like Airborne LASER Mine Detection System, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block III, Fire Scout and bridge and navigation systems for both the Freedom and Independence variants of LCS. During 2023, 15% of NOC\u2019s sales came from the Navy.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 4.6% from the prior-year figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics is the lead integrator for the Independence-variant LCS. It is responsible for the design, integration and testing of the navigation, command, control, computing and aviation systems on each ship. In 2023, its Marins Systems business segment generated 23% of its total revenues.\n\nGD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 10.5% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of LMT have rallied 4.2% against the industry\u2019s 7% decline.

        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently clinched a modification contract involving the AIM-9X Block II missile. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $18 million, the contract is expected to be completed by June 2026. The latest modification adds scope for RTX to offer continued studies involving future updates to the AIM-9X missile system, in conjunction with the AIM-9X Block II and Block II+ System Improvement Program Increment IV.\n\nWork related to this deal will be executed in Tucson, AZ. The contract is set to serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Army, as well as foreign military sales customers.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like RTX, which is a prominent missile maker in the United States with a strong international presence.\n\nNotably, RTX\u2019s AIM-9X Sidewinder is the most advanced infrared-tracking, short-range, air-to-air and surface-to-air missile in the world. It is configured for easy installation in a range of modern aircraft, including Boeing\u2019s F-15, F/A-18 and E/A-18G, and Lockheed\u2019s F-22 and F-35 fighters.\n\nThe latest variant of AIM-9X Sidewinder, the AIM-9X Block II missile features a redesigned fuse and a digital ignition safety device that enhances ground handling and in-flight safety. Backed by such advanced technology, the company witnesses significant orders for the same, like the latest one. The demand for this product line of RTX can be further gauged from the fact that the AIM-9X SIDEWINDER missile has 31 foreign military sales partners.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nSuch a solid market growth projection stands to benefit RTX, which enjoys an extensive missile portfolio, including SM-6, SM-3 interceptor, TOW missiles and many more weapons, apart from the AIM-9X missile.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nOther defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missile and missile defense market are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: Lockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products are the PAC-3 missile and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile.\n\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: The company\u2019s Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.\n\nGD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates growth of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of RTX have risen 14% against the industry\u2019s decline of 7%.

        "title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well",
        "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nHow Much Debt Does Lockheed Martin Carry?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2024 Lockheed Martin had debt of US$19.4b, up from US$15.6b in one year. However, it does have US$2.79b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$16.6b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nA Look At Lockheed Martin's Liabilities\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Lockheed Martin had liabilities of US$17.7b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$30.6b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$2.79b as well as receivables valued at US$16.3b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$29.2b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Lockheed Martin is worth a massive US$112.1b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nLockheed Martin's net debt of 1.6 times EBITDA suggests graceful use of debt. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 9.2 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. And we also note warmly that Lockheed Martin grew its EBIT by 18% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Lockheed Martin can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Lockheed Martin generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 82% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, Lockheed Martin's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its interest cover also supports that impression! Zooming out, Lockheed Martin seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Lockheed Martin has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "content": "For long-term investors seeking to capitalize on undervalued opportunities, there are several undervalued stocks that present attractive valuations relative to their intrinsic worth. These companies offer a unique combination of discounted prices and strong growth potential.\n\nAs we look to the future, these companies are well-positioned for substantial growth, underpinned by favorable industry tailwinds and strategic expansions.\n\nInvesting in the stocks outlined in this article could potentially lead to market-beating returns in the foreseeable future. While some of these stocks may be less risky than others, focusing on an income strategy, they all have the potential to add stability and impressive gains to one\u2019s portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo with that being said, here are seven undervalued stocks that investors should consider adding to their portfolios. I think that these names represent the best value for money in the market right now.\n\nQuantum Computing (QUBT) A concept image showing a quantum computer with a matrix background; quantum computing. leading quantum stocks, Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nQuantum Computing (NASDAQ:QUBT) focuses on quantum computing solutions. Despite recent financial misses, it\u2019s poised for significant long-term growth.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Quantum Computing reported a revenue of $0.08 million and an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.09, missing analyst expectations. However, the company remains committed to developing its quantum computing technologies.\n\nQuantum Computing has made progress in product development, including the release of five new products since acquiring QPhoton. The company is also expanding its manufacturing capacity and building a quantum chip facility to support future product design and development. This includes the production of various lithium niobate chips, such as physical unclonable function (PUF) and electro-optic modulator (EOM) chips, expected to launch in 2024.\n\nFinancially, Quantum Computing is exploring non-dilutive funding options to support its growth and maintain shareholder value. The company\u2019s balance sheet remains stable with $71.4 million in cash, providing a solid foundation.\n\nAirbus (EADSY) An image of an orange eVTOL sitting on a helipad, the ocean in the background. best flying car stocks\n\nSource: Chesky / Shutterstock\n\nAirbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) is actively developing the CityAirbus project, aiming to introduce a fleet of electric flying taxis for urban transportation.\n\nThe CityAirbus NextGen is a fully electric, four-seat vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft designed for urban air mobility. It features fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered propellers. The CityAirbus NextGen project has made significant strides, with the prototype set for its maiden flight later in 2024. Airbus has leveraged years of research and development, incorporating insights from its previous demonstrators.\n\nStory continues\n\nEADSY is one of the two major airliners in the world, so I think that it could have an entrenched advantage in terms of its competitive positioning for flying cars.\n\nFinancially, Airbus reported strong performance in the first quarter of 2024, with consolidated revenues increasing by 9% year-over-year to \u20ac12.8 billion, driven by higher commercial aircraft deliveries.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130J Super Hercules of the United States Air Force performing at Aero India 2017.\n\nSource: Joe Ravi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has stable government contracts and is undervalued with a low P/E ratio as one of the most important defense contractors in the world.\n\nLMT has shown stable performance and provided a positive outlook for 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, LMT reported net sales of $17.2 billion, up from $15.1 billion in Q1 2023. Despite this increase in sales, net earnings decreased to $1.5 billion or $6.39 per share, compared to $1.7 billion or $6.61 per share in Q1 2023. LMT\u2019s backlog remains strong at $159 billion, reflecting significant national security space awards.\n\nLooking forward to 2024, LMT reaffirms its financial guidance, projecting net sales between $68.5 billion and $70 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $25.65 to $26.35. The company expects free cash flow between $6 billion and $6.3 billion for the year\u200b. It could then be seen as one of those undervalued picks that investors should pay attention to.\n\nAltria Group (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria Group (NYSE:MO), known for its tobacco products, offers a high dividend yield and is diversifying into alternative products. Its undervaluation and stable cash flow make it an attractive option for value investors.\r\n\r\nMO\u2019s cigarette shipment volume dropped by 10% in Q1 2024, primarily due to industry decline rates and the rise of illicit e-vapor products. Marlboro\u2019s retail share in the cigarette category remained stable at 42%.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, MO reaffirms its guidance, expecting full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be between $5.05 and $5.17, reflecting a growth rate of 2% to 4.5% from a base of $4.95 in 2023\u200b.\n\nMO\u2019s top-line has been decreasing, but it still produces an absurd amount of free cash flow, much of which it distributes to investors as a dividend. It has plenty of runway left to successfully transition to the smokeless products segment.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is investing heavily in semiconductor manufacturing and innovation. Despite recent challenges, its market position and ongoing investments in new technologies suggest that it is undervalued and poised for a strong recovery.\n\nINTC reported first-quarter 2024 revenue of $12.8 billion, which is within its guidance range of $12.5-13.5 billion. However, this guidance was below analyst expectations of $14.2 billion. The company\u2019s gross margin was 40.2% on a GAAP basis and 43.5% on a non-GAAP basis\u200b.\n\nFor Q1 2024, INTC\u2019s EPS was $0.13, also lower than the expected $0.33 per share. Despite these lower-than-expected figures, INTC remains focused on its long-term investments in semiconductor manufacturing.\r\n\r\nINTC also plans to continue its IDM 2.0 strategy, focusing on expanding its foundry business and investing in new semiconductor fabrication facilities, including a new plant in Ireland with $2 billion in funding.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is advancing its Thacker Pass project in Nevada, which holds the largest-known lithium reserve in the U.S. The company secured a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy..\n\nThe project is expected to produce 40,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of battery-quality lithium carbonate. The construction of Thacker Pass is projected to create approximately 1,800 direct jobs over the three-year build period\u200b.\n\nIn Q1 2024, LAC reported an increase in total assets, largely due to the capitalization of Thacker Pass costs.\n\nAnalyst ratings for LAC are generally positive, with a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d and an average price target suggesting significant potential upside.\n\nAt just $3.91 per share, LAc could be significantly undervalued relative to its long-term growth potential.\n\nIris Energy (IREN) An image of a miner with a pickaxe mining digital coins, computer code and various numbers are overlaid on the image\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nIris Energy (NASDAQ:IREN), based in Australia, focuses on renewable energy for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining.\n\nThe demand for companies like IREN, which provide sustainable power solutions for Bitcoin miners, is expected to rise. Bitcoin mining is highly energy-intensive, and regulatory scrutiny over its environmental impact is likely. IREN offers a competitive edge for Bitcoin miners by mitigating these risks with its renewable energy approach.\n\nIREN\u2019s growth outlook for 2024 is a key reason for its perceived undervaluation. The company plans to significantly expand its operations, aiming to increase its operating capacity from 5.6 EH/s to 20 EH/s by year-end. This growth will be supported by 9 EH/s of miner purchase options available for exercise in the second half of 2024.\n\nCombined with its forward P/E ratio of 8 times earnings, IREN presents a compelling investment opportunity in the blockchain sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the most powerful military in the world. We have created a list of 25 most powerful militaries, for full free list, visit Top 25 Powerful Countries in the World by Military Strength.\n\nFigures released last month by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated the global defense expenditure at $2.44 trillion for 2023, a record-high, having risen 6.8% compared to the previous year. This was the biggest spike in military spending since 2009, and the ninth successive year during which military expenditure had risen.\n\nThe United States represented 37.5% of the world\u2019s overall defense expenditure, having spent $916 billion during the year. This figure, which grew 2.3% from 2022, amounted to 68% of all NATO spending in 2023. In Europe, $588 billion were spent on military expenses, which made up around one-fourths (24%) of the global expenditure. This was 16% more than in 2022, and 64% higher than a decade ago in 2014. Both Moscow and Kyiv substantially increased their military expenditure, while several other countries in the continent also bolstered their defenses with war returning to Europe after decades of peace.\n\nMoreover, $560 billion was incurred on military expenditure in Asia, with the figure having risen 40% compared to 2014. The major chunk of this spending came from East Asia and South Asia, while countries in the Middle East also spent hefty amounts on bolstering their national security.\n\nThe surge in global military spending since the beginning of the war in Ukraine has meant a boom for major corporations in the defense industry. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East, which started in October 2023, has also bolstered their finances. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stocks have spiked 29% since Russia invaded Ukraine. In 2023, the company generated $67.6 billion in revenue, which represented a 2.4% increase from 2022. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s net earnings for the year were also $1.2 billion higher than the previous year.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers are also soaring. The company posted a whopping $68.9 billion in revenue in 2023, nearly 60% of which came from defense related sales. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has received orders worth $3 billion alone for its AMRAAM rockets that have been instrumental for Ukraine in pushing back advancing Russian troops. Last year in March, the company was awarded a $1.2 billion contract from Germany as well to develop Patriot air and missile defense systems for the country. Later in November during the same year, Hungary received the first two units of the NASAMS air defense system it ordered from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) recorded its highest revenue in history in 2023, totaling $42.3 billion, a year-on-year increase of 7.3%. The company\u2019s artillery production went up last year from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s 155-millimeter artillery replacements have played a vital role in leading Ukraine\u2019s fightback against Russia. These have been regularly provided by the Americans to Kyiv as part of Washington\u2019s military assistance. Nearly three-fourths of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s overall revenue comes from defense-related sales. The Most Powerful Country in the World by Military Strength\n\nBPTU/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered thirteen weighted metrics to rank the top 25 powerful countries in the world by military strength. These include GDP and defense spending (25%); strength of ground forces (25%) which comprised manpower, tanks, artillery, and nuclear weapons; fleet of military aircraft (20%); naval assets including aircraft carriers and submarines (10%); military technological advancement (10%); military satellites in orbit (5%); overseas military bases (3%); and cyber-capabilities (2%).\n\nIt was observed where each country ranked on a given metric, and assigned them weighted ranking scores. Finally, weighted scores for each metric were summed to get an overall score. Additional 5%, or 0.05 points, were added to the tally of countries that had battle-hardened troops. The most powerful countries in the world by military strength are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nData related to GDP figures for countries in 2023 was sourced from the IMF, while SIPRI was consulted for figures related to defense expenditure during the year. For other metrics, we considered Insider Monkey\u2019s recent articles: 20 Largest Air Forces in the World Heading into 2024, 15 Countries with the Most Battle Tanks in the World, Artillery Strength by Country: Top 20 Militaries, 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World, 12 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers, 13 Countries With The Most Overseas Military Bases, 15 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Satellites in Orbit, and 12 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity. Moreover, for manpower we referred to the Global Firepower Index 2024, whereas Power Atlas was considered for information related to nuclear weapons. Lastly, the Global Innovation Index 2023 was referenced for technological capabilities.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe most powerful country in the world by military strength is the United States.\n\n1. United States\n\nGDP (2023): $27 trillion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $916 billion\n\nNuclear Weapons: 5,550\n\nManpower: 1,328,000\n\nTanks: 4,657\n\nArtillery: 3,556\n\nAircraft/Fighter Jets: 5,209\n\nAircraft Carriers: 11\n\nSubmarines: 64\n\nMilitary Satellites in Orbit: 218\n\nOverseas Military Bases: 759\n\nCyber Capabilities Rank: 1\n\nTechnological Capabilities Rank: 3\n\nOverall Score: 0.87\n\nThe United States is the most powerful country in the world by military strength. It outranks all countries of the world in three key areas of military power \u2013 ground forces, air force, and navy. The country spent $916 billion on defense expenditure in 2023, which was equivalent to nearly two-fifths of the world military spending. Moreover, the country has the largest fleet of fighter jets and aircraft carriers in the world, which is testament to its military strength. Another vital factor that makes the US military so powerful is the geographic advantage it enjoys with its 759 overseas bases spread across 80 countries which allow Washington to strike any enemy anywhere at will.\n\nTo find out the rest of the 24 countries, visit our free list of Top 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and A New Dawn Is Coming to US Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "NASA Confirms Boeing's Delayed Starliner Launch Despite Helium Leak\n\nBoeing (NYSE:\u00a0BA) and NASA are reportedly advancing with launching the company\u2019s Starliner capsule, set to carry\u00a0U.S.\u00a0astronauts for the first time, despite a stable leak in the spacecraft\u2019s propulsion system.\n\nThis mission, known as the Starliner Crew Flight Test, is a critical final development test.\n\nIt aims to\u00a0deliver\u00a0a pair of NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station before\u00a0commencing\u00a0routine missions.\n\nAlso Read: Boeing\u2019s Starliner Crewed Test Flight Postponed Due To Technical Issue, Continuing Challenges In Space Program\n\nCNBC\u00a0reported that the first crewed launch of Starliner\u00a0is targeted\u00a0for June 1, with backup opportunities on June 2, June 5, and June 6.\n\nThe debut of Starliner\u2019s crew has faced years of delays, while SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule has been regularly flying astronauts for NASA since 2020.\n\nBoeing has incurred $1.5 billion in costs due to setbacks with Starliner, on top of nearly $5 billion in NASA development funds.\n\nA launch attempt on May 6 was\u00a0aborted\u00a0two hours before liftoff due to an issue with the Atlas V rocket, built and operated by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT).\n\nA ULA official noted that the rocket\u2019s problematic valve was replaced within a week. Subsequently, a \u201csmall\u201d helium leak in Starliner\u00a0was identified, prompting new assessments of the capsule\u2019s safety.\n\nNASA Associate Administrator\u00a0Ken Bowersox explained that the helium leak issue took time to analyze due to its complexity, emphasizing the collaborative effort required to resolve it.\n\nFollowing analysis, NASA and Boeing determined the leak originated from a seal in one of the spacecraft\u2019s helium propulsion system flanges.\n\nTesting after the May 6 postponement indicated that the leak rate remained stable.\n\nCiting NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program manager\u00a0Steve Stich, CNBC noted that the plan is to monitor the leak before launch and reassess it after reaching the International Space Station.\n\nStich expressed confidence in the other seals\u2019 integrity, noting that NASA has previously flown vehicles with small helium leaks, including\u00a0missions by the\u00a0Space Shuttle\u00a0and SpaceX\u2019s Dragon.\n\nA final review of the leak is scheduled for May 29, with plans to roll the\u00a0rocket and capsule to the launch pad on May 30 for the June 1 attempt.\n\nPrice Action: BA\u00a0shares\u00a0are\u00a0up 1.28% at $174.42\u00a0at the last check\u00a0on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced\u00a0with the help of\u00a0AI\u00a0tools and\u00a0was\u00a0reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nBOEING (BA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article NASA Confirms Boeing's Delayed Starliner Launch Despite Helium Leak originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Bulletproof Your Portfolio: 3 Defense Stocks to Own Now",
        "content": "With two significant wars at the moment, you would think the question of which defense stocks to buy would be a topic of interest for investors.\u00a0However, according to Barron\u2019s, the top five defense stocks: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and RTX (NYSE:RTX) have only gained an average of 30% over the past five years, significantly less than the index itself. That could explain some of the investor reluctance.\n\nMoreover, the industry feels inadvertently unpredictable to many investors, with the potential for government spending priorities to shift based on the administration. Nevertheless, defense stocks, if selected correctly, can be exceptionally defensive for a portfolio. That\u2019s because not all defense stocks rely on large government spending packages to remain competitive, due to the critical nature of the products they sell, like ammo or aircraft maintenance parts.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in defense stocks, here are three to buy to bulletproof your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX), formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has three operating segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon. Collins sells products and services to aircraft manufacturers, airlines, the U.S. government, defense contractors, and independent distributors worldwide. Pratt & Whitney supplies aircraft engines to both commercial and military customers. Lastly, Raytheon manufactures and sells advanced radar detection systems and sensors for missile defense applications.\n\nAll three sectors generated around $6.5 billion in revenue in Q1, 2024. However, of the three, Raytheon had the highest operating margin at 15.0%, 230 basis points higher than Collins Aerospace and more than double Pratt & Whitney\u2019s.\u00a0Together, RTX had total segment sales of $19.79 billion and operating profits of $2.26 billion, both considerably higher than a year ago.\n\nWhile its shares aren\u2019t cheap, the company continues to grow revenues and operating profits at a decent pace, making it a good long-term hold. It\u2019s also an incredibly relevant producer of defense technologies, as the wars of today depend on missile technology more than ever before.\n\nHeico (HEI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHeico (NYSE:HEI) was founded in 1957 and today operates two segments: Flight Support Group (60% of revenue) and Electronic Technologies Group (40%).\n\nThe Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration guidelines. It also repairs, overhauls, and distributes jet engines and aircraft components like avionics and instruments for domestic and foreign commercial air carriers, aircraft repair companies, and military and business aircraft operators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Electronic Technologies Group designs, manufactures, and sells various electronic, microwave, and electro-optical products. From the time the current management took control of the business in 1990 through fiscal 2023, its annual revenues have grown from $26 million to nearly $3 billion, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%. The CAGR for its net income is even higher at 18%.\n\nOver the past three years, its annualized revenue and operating income growth rate was 18.4%.\u00a0While analysts are lukewarm about its business, its shares have doubled over the past five years for a reason.\n\nNational Presto Industries (NPK) Gold shield; digital shield, defense, protection\n\nSource: anttoniart / Shutterstock\n\nThis last pick is a bit of a wildcard. National Presto Industries (NYSE:NPK). According to MarketWatch, only one analyst covers the small-cap stock, rating it a buy, with a $128 target, 68% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nNational Presto is one of those stocks you buy and forget about for years because it does a few things rather than specializing in one industry or sector. It operates three businesses: Housewares/Small Appliances (29% of revenue), Defense (70%), and Safety (1%).\n\nConsumers could be familiar with its housewares segment, which makes everything from skillets and griddles to air fryers and rice cookers, even coffee makers. However, it\u2019s the defense segment that gets it into this article.\n\nThe company has several subsidiaries under the National Defense Corporation, including AMTEC, which manufactures 40mm ammunition for the U.S. Department of Defense. As I mentioned, defense accounts for nearly three-quarters of its annual revenue and about 84% of its operating profits.\n\nOf the three defense stocks, National Presto is the value play. Its enterprise value of $476 million is 10.5x its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), way less than RTX (18.6x) and HEI (35.3x).\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "RTX Secures a $227M Contract to Support AIM-9X Missile Program",
        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently clinched a contract involving its AIM-9X and AIM-9X Block II missiles. The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $227.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by May 2029. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will provide depot-level repairs and other related services to support AIM-9X and AIM-9X Block II missile sustainment efforts.\n\nThese services include logistics support, sustainment engineering, software support, integration support, failure analysis, configuration management, technical data, diminishing manufacturing sources, material shortages management, training, field support, spare predictions, ordnance assessment, reliability, and management of government property.\n\nMajority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Tucson, AZ.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like RTX, which is a prominent missile maker in the United States with a strong international presence.\r\n\r\nNotably, RTX\u2019s AIM-9X Sidewinder is the most advanced infrared-tracking, short-range, air-to-air and surface-to-air missile in the world. It is configured for easy installation in a range of modern aircraft, including Boeing\u2019s F-15, F/A-18 and E/A-18G and Lockheed\u2019s F-22 and F-35 fighters.\n\nThe latest variant of AIM-9X Sidewinder, the AIM-9X Block II missile features a redesigned fuse and a digital ignition safety device that enhances ground handling and in-flight safety. Backed by such advanced technology, the company witnesses significant orders for the same, like the latest one. The demand for this product line of RTX can be further gauged from the fact that the AIM-9X SIDEWINDER missile has 31 foreign military sales partners.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch a solid market growth projection stands to benefit RTX, which enjoys an extensive missile portfolio, including SM-6, SM-3 interceptor, TOW missiles and many more such weapons, apart from the AIM-9X missile.\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nOther defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missile and missile defense market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nLockheed Martin LMT: Lockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products are the PAC-3 missile and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile.\n\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lockheed\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: General Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.\r\n\r\nGD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics\u2019 2024 sales indicates growth of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of RTX have risen 13.2% against the industry\u2019s decline of 6.6%.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) Returns Have Hit A Wall",
        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Lockheed Martin is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$9.0b \u00f7 (US$55b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 24%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace & Defense industry average of 9.8%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Lockheed Martin's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Lockheed Martin .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Lockheed Martin Tell Us?\n\nThere hasn't been much to report for Lockheed Martin's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. Although current returns are high, we'd need more evidence of underlying growth for it to look like a multi-bagger going forward. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Lockheed Martin has been paying out a decent 49% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nAlthough is allocating it's capital efficiently to generate impressive returns, it isn't compounding its base of capital, which is what we'd see from a multi-bagger. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 56% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a final note, we've found  2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that we think you should be aware of.\n\nHigh returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Kratos' (KTOS) SATCOM System Showcased at Space Symposium",
        "content": "Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. KTOS recently announced that BlueHalo showcased the capabilities of its completely virtualized satellite communications (SATCOM) ground system, OpenSpace, at the 2024 Space Symposium held in Colorado. At this symposium, BlueHalo exhibited the utility of integrated backend mission services for the U.S. Space Force\u2019s (\u201cUSSF\u201d) Satellite Communication Augmentation Resource (\u201cSCAR\u201d) program and the importance of OpenSpace in the backend system.\n\nBenefits of the OpenSpace Platform\n\nBuilt upon widely accepted industry standards and a containerized architecture, Kratos' OpenSpace Platform is a completely software-defined and managed satellite ground system that enables scalable deployments inside an elastic, cloud-agnostic, virtualized environment. The Space Force can instantiate new services using OpenSpace in minutes as opposed to the weeks or even months that are typically needed with conventional hardware-based ground systems.\r\n\r\nIt is the industry\u2019s only commercially available digital transformation solution that enables operators of satellites, Ground Systems-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers, teleports and others in the satellite services supply chain to capitalize on dynamic ground capabilities.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nFactors like increasing earth observation missions, rapid digitization of industries across the board, rising usage of satellite communications in tactical operations and the growing use of satellite internet services have been boosting reliance on satcom-dependent services. This has prompted major nations like the United States, Germany, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom to aggressively invest in satellite deployment, thereby significantly bolstering the Satellite Communications market.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Satellite Communications market\u2019s prospects remain robust, particularly driven by rapid growth in the launch of the Low Earth Orbit satellites and the expanding use of satellite technology in military and government applications. To this end, per a report by the Markets and Markets firm, the global SATCOM market is projected to witness a CAGR of 11.3% during the 2023-2028 period.\r\n\r\nSuch a solid market prediction offers strong growth opportunities to Kratos Defense, which, for more than 30 years, has been providing satellite Command & Control (C2) products and services, with a long history of successful SATCOM NetOps execution of commercial, military, civil and intelligence community satellite ground segment programs. For instance, its EPOCH product provides powerful satellite C2 for individual satellites, as well as small and large constellations of various designs and complexities.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nConsidering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global Satellite Communications market, other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Airbus SE EADSY and Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC, with a strong presence in this space, should also benefit.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin uses cutting-edge technology to build capabilities that comprise layered space defense systems. The LM 400, a multi-mission satellite that can be tailored for almost any mission, is LMT\u2019s most flexible satellite bus.\r\n\r\nLMT boasts a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 3.2% from the previous year's estimated figure.\r\n\r\nAirbus is a world leader in military satellite communication services with a broad portfolio of services, including the SATCOMBw, Syracuse 4A and 4B, Skynet 5 and many more. Airbus has been a long-term operator of the SATCOMBw secure satellite communications system for Germany\u2019s Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nEADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 21.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 8.2% from the previous year's estimated figure.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman\u2019s portfolio of space systems includes Strategic SATCOM, Protected Tactical SATCOM satellites and payloads. Its GEOStar geostationary Earth orbit commercial satellites are among the industry's best-selling small and medium-class communications satellites.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from the year-ago estimated figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past three months, shares of Kratos Defense have risen 15.4% compared with the industry\u2019s average return of 0.1%.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) Wins Contract to Aid Missile Production",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT Space Systems business unit recently clinched a modification contract involving missile production. The award has been offered by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $99 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Feb 2, 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide systems engineering, test planning and long lead material to support missile production.\n\nA major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Denver, CO.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoys a dominant position in the development of missiles.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed\u2019s weapon systems include precision strike weapons with long standoff ranges to keep pilots and aircraft out of harm's way.\r\n\r\nOther missiles manufactured by Lockheed include air-to-air missiles to provide pilots with air supremacy; helicopter-launched anti-armor missiles to destroy enemy tanks and other armored vehicles; man-portable short-range anti-armor and assault weapons; kinetic energy hyper-velocity missiles that can defeat all current and future armored threats, hit-to-kill air defense systems that protect the troops from ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, enemy aircraft and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSuch a varied number of missiles in its product portfolio has been ushering in solid order flow for Lockheed, involving missile production and other associated services like the latest one.\n\nGrowth Prospect\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide, with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nLMT\u2019s proficiency in manufacturing varied missiles, positions it favorably to capitalize on the growth opportunities offered by the missile and missile defense systems market. The fact that Lockheed is currently on track to double the production of its HIMARS to 96 per year and deliver more than 10,000 GMLRS by the end of 2024, and has increased Javelin\u2019s production to 2,400 units per year, makes us confident about the company receiving more missile-related order flows in future, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company\u2019s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year top-line growth in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics GD: The company\u2019s Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It is a key supplier of major strategic and tactical missile programs, ranging from warheads to missile housings to structural components to solid rocket motor cases.\n\nGD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. The consensus estimate for General Dynamics\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp. RTX: RTX\u2019s business unit, Missiles and Defense, is a prominent U.S. missile maker. Its portfolio includes the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, the AIM-9X Block II missile, RAM-guided missile weapon system, etc. In a partnership with BAE Systems, RTX has built the Excalibur artillery projectile, which increases precision, minimizes collateral damage and reduces the logistical burden for artillery forces.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Lockheed have risen 3.8% against the industry\u2019s 6.8% decline.

        "title": "The Largest Weapon Manufacturer in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the largest weapon manufacturer in the world. If interested, you can also view our recently released complete list of the 15 Largest Weapon Manufacturers in the World.\n\nLatest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in April this year estimated the global military spending in 2023 at a record-high of $2.44 trillion, up 6.8% compared to 2022. The year witnessed the steepest rise in defense expenditure since 2009, and was the ninth successive year in which defense spending had increased worldwide.\n\nThe United States continued to remain the largest spender on military expenditure in 2023 as well, having incurred a whopping $916 billion in defense bills during the year, growing 2.3% from last year. Washington\u2019s spending represented 37.5% of the world\u2019s military expenditure, and accounted for 68% of all NATO spending. $588 billion was spent by countries in Europe, which was equivalent to 24% of the global share. Of this amount, an overwhelming 69% was expensed in Central and Western Europe. Both Russia and Ukraine substantially increased their military expenditure during the year, whereas other countries in the region actively racked up their defenses as well with war having returned to the continent after decades of peace.\n\nAnother report by SIPRI highlighted that arms imported by countries in Europe between 2019-2023 were 94% higher than the monetary volume in 2014-2018. The United States was the origin of an estimated 55% of all weapons received by Europe, making the country the largest exporter of arms in the world.\n\nThe spike in defense expenditure has resulted in a boom in the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stock price has surged 29% since the start of the war in Ukraine. Several countries in Europe are eying the company\u2019s famed F-35 fifth-generation fighter, while the production of HIMARS is also in full swing to replenish stocks of allies arming Kyiv. This month, the US Army awarded a $861 million contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for the supply of additional HIMARS, believed to be linked to military assistance for Ukraine. According to the Defense Post, the contract did not specify the number of launchers ordered, but is expected to be around 288 based on previous solicitation documents that were seen.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers have also been promising, having posted $68.9 billion in revenue in 2023, with a year-on-year growth of 3%, aided by the ongoing conflict in Europe. Between February 2022, when the war started, and October 2023, the company had received orders worth $3 billion for its AMRAAM rockets alone to assist Ukraine in pushing back advancing Russian troops. Earlier last year in March, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) also won a $1.2 billion contract from Germany to build Patriot air and missile defense systems for the country and boost its air defenses, while in November, Hungary received the delivery of two units of the NASAMS air defense system it had ordered from Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) too posted its highest-ever revenue in history last year, totaling $42.3 billion, up 7.7% from the previous year. The company has reported an increase in its artillery production from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000. The company\u2019s 155 millimeter artillery replacements have played a vital role in Kyiv\u2019s fightback against Russia, which have been regularly provided to the country as part of military assistance by the United States.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s take a look at the largest weapon manufacturer in the world. The Largest Weapon Manufacturer in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list, we ranked the largest weapon manufacturers in the world in ascending order of their arms revenue in 2022. This is the latest year for which revenue breakdown is available for all major defense companies in the world. Data has been sourced from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe largest weapon manufacturer in the world is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).\n\n1. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\n\nCountry of Origin: United States\n\nTotal Revenue in 2022: $65.98 billion\n\nArms Revenue in 2022: $59.39 billion\n\nShare of Overall Revenue: 90%\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is the largest weapon manufacturer in the world, with over $59 billion worth of arms revenue in 2022 \u2013 three-fourths of which came from over $45 billion in DoD contracts. It is the manufacturer of the famed F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet, and the company is likely to retain its status as a cornerstone for the US Air Force as it works alongside other partners in the industry on the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program to build a sixth-generation fighter.\n\nYou can see the rest of the rankings here.\n\nIf you are looking for states where the US military spends the most funds, you can head over to our article on the Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money.\n\nREAD NEXT:15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC recently secured a modification contract for the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS). The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $49 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Mar 31, 2025. The work related to this deal will be executed at Huntsville, AL. The contract includes foreign military sales to Poland.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Northrop?\n\nMissile defense plays a pivotal role in a nation\u2019s defense strategy. Nations are thus reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. To this end, it is imperative to mention that Northrop Grumman\u2019s IBCS is the centerpiece of the U.S. Army\u2019s modernization strategy for air and missile defense capability.\n\nNotably, the company pioneered the development of integrated battle command solutions and interoperable defense systems. The solid demand for NOC\u2019s IBCS can be gauged from the fact that IBCS seamlessly fused data from a Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor to acquire, track, engage and intercept a long-range cruise missile surrogate with a PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement during a recent test event held at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, in April.\n\nNaturally, being a prominent defense contractor, the company frequently wins contracts involving notable missile defense products like IBCS. The latest contract win is an example.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nThis should bode well for the missile industry, as evident from the Mordor Intelligence firm\u2019s report, which estimates the missile and missile defense systems market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nNOC\u2019s proficiency in missile manufacturing positions it favorably to capitalize on such market growth opportunities. Its product portfolio includes the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nApart from NOC, other major missile makers like RTX Corp. RTX, Lockheed Martin LMT and General Dynamics GD are also expected to benefit from the aforementioned prospects of the missile and missile defense market.\r\n\r\nRTX\u2019s business unit, Missiles and Defense, is a prominent U.S. missile maker.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nLockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control unit provides combat-proven air and missile defense systems as well as tactical missiles. These include Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, Multiple Launch Rocket System and a few more missile programs.\n\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%.

        "title": "7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "On a day-to-day basis, the stock market can do almost anything. Short-term returns tend to be highly volatile and quite random in nature. One day meme stocks can skyrocket and the next day, an unexpected piece of economic data can cause the stock market to tank. Many people compare the stock market to a casino, and not without some merit.\n\nIn the bigger picture, however, stocks tend to be more predictable. As the overall economy grows in size and companies generate higher levels of earnings, it tends to lead to rising stock prices and dividend payouts.\n\nFor investors with some patience and willingness to hold companies over the long haul, the stock market has been proven to be a reliable way to generate wealth. These seven long-term stocks to buy, in particular, have excellent track records and operate in businesses and industries that should continue to prosper for many years to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcCormick (MKC) McCormick & Company spices lined up on a grocery store shelf.\n\nSource: Arne Beruldsen / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcCormick (NYSE:MKC) is the dominant leader within the U.S. spices and seasonings market.\n\nUnlike many packaged food companies, McCormick faces surprisingly little competition. It controls an estimated\u00a040% to 60% market share in its primary categories, coming in at more than double that of its nearest branded competitor. It is also a leading producer of store-brand spices, meaning consumers often choose between a McCormick bottle of spice or a McCormick-manufactured store-brand alternative.\n\nThis quasi-monopoly position has made McCormick a tremendous long-term investment. MKC stock has risen more than 8,000% over the past 40 years.\n\nPast returns are no guarantee of future results, however. To keep its growth streak going, McCormick has expanded its product line-up. It now has a leading position in producing flavors and seasonings for restaurants and institutional kitchens. Furthermore, McCormick is making deals, such as its acquisitions including Frank\u2019s and Cholula in the hot sauce space.\n\nMcCormick is one of the companies least prone to technological disruption. Humans love tasty food, and if anything, younger consumers are more interested in cooking, international cuisines and unique flavors than ever before. McCormick\u2019s dominant market position in a timeless business makes it a wonderful long-term holding.\n\nBrown-Forman (BF-A, BF-B) Person holding cellphone with logo of American spirits company Brown-Forman (BF-B) Corporation on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nBrown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A, NYSE:BF-B) is one of America\u2019s leading alcoholic spirits companies. Founded in 1870, the company even managed to survive America\u2019s nearly 14-year alcohol prohibition period.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrown-Forman is most well-known for its Jack Daniels whiskey. Under Brown-Forman\u2019s ownership, Jack Daniels has grown from a small regional brand to a global powerhouse. The company is also rolling out far more expensive premium brands such as Woodford Reserve; the future for the spirits industry isn\u2019t primarily in selling more alcohol but rather in selling much higher-quality alcohol.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t just whiskey, either. Brown-Forman\u2019s\u00a0Casa Herradura tequila acquisition in 2007 looks particularly shrewd. Tequila has gone on to become a fast-growing spirit in the North American market, one where premium and super-premium products are now gaining appeal.\n\nThe final element of the long-term story is ownership. The Brown family continues to\u00a0control the company via ownership of the A-class shares, which have voting rights. That structure protects Brown-Forman from takeovers and allows this long-term stock to buy to keep delivering outsized returns on a generational timeframe.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) has returned to form. The company has been one of the best long-term large-cap stocks in America over time.\n\nBut its rise was temporarily disrupted during the pandemic. V stock slipped as it lost out on its most profitable transactions, the cross-border ones that involve currency exchange.\n\nAdditionally, a surge in FinTech companies and cryptocurrency and blockchain back in 2021 created the idea that there would be much more competition to credit card networks. Fast forward to 2024, however, and almost all these issues have been alleviated.\n\nThe global economy has largely returned to form, with international travel enjoying an especially swift recovery. Meanwhile, the FinTech sector has struggled to maintain its momentum and has barely impacted results for Visa or Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Similarly, while cryptocurrency remains interesting for trading purposes, so far no killer app has emerged within crypto that would meaningfully disrupt Visa.\n\nOver the long term, people will continue shifting more transactions from cash to credit and digital payments; that\u2019s especially true in developing countries. As inflation works its way through the global economy, transaction sizes grow, which naturally lifts Visa\u2019s revenues and earnings. All this makes Visa a highly reliable long-term stock to own.\n\nEcolab (ECL) Ecolab (ECL) logo on its corporate headquarters building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nEcolab (NYSE:ECL) is the world\u2019s largest cleaning and sanitation company. It aims to be a one-stop shop for its customers, offering cleaning supplies and chemicals, pest control, water treatment and related services.\n\nThe company realized early on that it could acquire a nearly unlimited number of mom-and-pop cleaning and sanitation shops. It has been rolling up the industry for decades, assembling a global sanitation and water treatment empire. To that point, Ecolab has been one of the best stocks for long-term investment, with shares rising more than 15,000% over the past 40 years.\n\nThe growth story is far from over. Though Ecolab is the industry leader, it only has an estimated 9% of the total\u00a0$152 billion global market. That means Ecolab can continue running its M&A playbook for many years to come.\n\nEcolab was hit hard during the pandemic as key customers like restaurants, hotels, cruise ships and so on lost business. But with the global economy roaring back to life, Ecolab has enjoyed a rapid recovery amid dramatic margin expansion. Simply put, this long-term stock champion is back to full health and is ready to reward shareholders once again.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the world\u2019s largest defense contractors.\n\nKnown for its fighter jet program, Lockheed Martin offers a wide array of defensive hardware that helps support almost all types of modern combat. In addition, the company has built an attractive space and satellite business that generates about $12 billion in annual revenues.\n\nLMT stock sold off in 2021 when the U.S. pulled forces out of Afghanistan, and some analysts felt this would lead to a fall in defense spending. Regrettably, however, global tensions swiftly mounted. First, there was Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and more recently, there has been conflict in the Middle East.\n\nBesides those active conflicts, tensions have also mounted between the U.S. and China over trade disputes and Taiwan\u2019s political status. All this should lead to outsized defense sector spending in coming years. Lockheed Martin\u2019s space business offers another reason for optimism with this long-term stock to buy.\n\nDentsply Sirona (XRAY) A concept image of a doctor holding up an X-Ray.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY) is a leading producer of dental equipment and supplies.\n\nThe company built its fortunes from its dental CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) systems. These CAD systems allow dentists and orthodontists to design customized tailored solutions for patients at the chairside, rather than having to refer work out to a third-party lab.\n\nIn addition, the rise of digital dentistry more broadly has been a huge tailwind for the industry. It makes it easier and cheaper to perform cosmetic work, thus expanding the addressable market. Dentsply Sirona, with its leading CAD/CAM tools, has held a first-mover advantage.\n\nXRAY stock has underperformed in recent years. The dental market slowed down during the pandemic \u2014 it seems that masking and being stuck at home somewhat impacted demand for cosmetic dentistry. There has also been mounting competition in the market, as often happens when a field enjoys rapid growth.\n\nThese factors have pushed XRAY stock down to just 13 times forward earnings, and analysts see earnings returning to double-digit annualized growth going forward. That, combined with the aging population, which will likely consume far more cosmetic dentistry services, should make XRAY stock a great long-term holding.\n\nDollar General (DG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDiscount retailer Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has had a rough past couple of years. Dollar General\u2019s stock price collapsed as revenue growth tailed off. Management blamed economic weakness among its core working-class consumer base for the business slowdown. While the economy is still growing, there are real signs of trouble for many Americans, and that has been reflected in results for discount retailers.\n\nThe business has had other issues as well. Investigative reports highlighted potentially unsafe\u00a0working conditions at some Dollar General stores. The company has also struggled to maintain fully-staffed stores at times amid the labor shortage of the past few years.\n\nHowever, these concerns should work themselves out in time. The economy appears to be decelerating now, which will clear up the labor shortages. And while Dollar General\u2019s core shoppers are facing economic strain right now, a more prolonged economic downturn should cause some more affluent consumers to trade down from pricier stores to Dollar General.\n\nThere is another reason for optimism. A rival, 99 Cents Only, shut down in April, with 371 stores being liquidated. That improves Dollar General\u2019s competitive positioning within the industry and sets it up to take market share and grow sales, especially once the next recession begins.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DG, XRAY, LMT, ECL, MKC, BF-B and V stock.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +1.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.1% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share, indicating a change of -4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 points to a change of -5.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $17.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2%. The $69.72 billion and $72.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) investors will be pleased with their notable 58% return over the last five years",
        "content": "If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 38% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year hasn't been great either, with the stock up just 2.7%.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Lockheed Martin managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.5% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 7% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Lockheed Martin's TSR for the last 5 years was 58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nLockheed Martin provided a TSR of 5.6% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 10% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Lockheed Martin has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find lesser know companies this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Bell-Boeing, a joint venture between The Boeing Company BA and Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. TXT, recently secured a contract involving the V-22 Osprey aircraft. The award has been provided by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $13.6 million, the contract is estimated to be completed by May 10, 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Bell-Boeing will provide spare consumable and depot-level repairable parts for the V-22 aircraft.\n\nThe work related to this deal will be carried out in Texas and Pennsylvania.\n\nGrowing Jet Demand & V-22 Jets\n\nA rapid increase in terror attacks across the globe has compelled nations to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget.\u00a0 The United States is the largest exporter of defense equipment across the world and therefore, the country witnesses a steady flow of contracts for its combat-proven weaponry from both the Pentagon and its foreign allies. With military jets and helicopters constituting a major portion of a nation\u2019s armaments, prominent jet manufacturers in the United States, like Textron and Boeing, frequently witness notable contract wins for combat-proven aircraft.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Bell-Boeing\u2019s primary product, V-22 Osprey, is a family of multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. V-22 Osprey is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.\n\nConsidering these features of the aforementioned family of tiltrotors and the growing demand for military aircraft, V-22 enjoys solid demand in the military jet market across the globe. The latest contract win is an example of that.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAmid geopolitical tensions like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, nations are rapidly augmenting their defense spending to procure more fighter jets. This, in turn, has been bolstering the prospects of the military aviation industry.\r\n\r\nPer a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global military aviation market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.23% in the 2024-2030 period. This will surely benefit major U.S. combat aircraft manufacturers like Textron, Boeing, Lockheed Martin LMT and Northrop Grumman NOC, with North America dominating this market space.\n\nLockheed is one of the pioneers in the combat aircraft space, with its product portfolio constituting some of the most advanced military aircraft like the F-35, C-130, F-16, F-22 and a few more. Of these, the F-35 is the company\u2019s largest program.\n\nStory continues\n\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nOn the other hand, Northrop is a renowned manufacturer of autonomous and manned aircraft like MQ-4C Triton and Global Hawk. These jets are used for battle management, strike and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement & Zacks Rank\n\nTextron\u2019s shares have risen 37.7% in the past year against the industry\u2019s 8% decline. Boeing\u2019s shares have lost 10.2% in the past year.

Its Everest Zero Trust solution has been designed to accelerate mission objectives by providing dynamic access to only the data and services where and when people need them, thereby securely sharing information with mission partners to achieve desired outcomes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, GD\u2019s Eclipse Defensive Cyber solution provides a comprehensive set of strategies and technologies to provide real-time threat detection, advanced incident response and remediation, as well as automated threat mitigation. Such capabilities of GDIT should enable it to win more such contracts, like the latest one, backed by the growing Defense Cybersecurity market size, which can be expected to boost its future revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nApart from General Dynamics, defense contractors that are expected to enjoy the perks of the growing Defense Cybersecurity spending market are as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It offers resilient, full-spectrum cyber solutions across every domain for a decisive advantage, giving cyber warfighters the defensive and offensive edge they need against evolving threats. Its products include Cyberdefense Platform for Weapon Systems, which enables cutting-edge AI/ML techniques to identify threats in mission and weapon systems that are currently undetectable by traditional network-based IDS solutions.\r\n\r\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: It remains a leading provider of defense technology in comprehensive cyber systems for its defense and global security customers. LMT\u2019s MR2 platform is helping the U.S. military digitally transform with real-time reports on employee training and readiness.\r\n\r\nLockheed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales implies growth of 3.2% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nBAE Systems BAESY: The company designs and builds a portfolio of cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies.

        "title": "How Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing All Lost a $30 Billion Air Force Contract",
        "content": "The United States Air Force needs a few good drones. It just doesn't need Boeing(NYSE: BA), Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT), or Northrop Grumman(NYSE: NOC) to build them. That's the surprising upshot of a new contract announcement out of the Pentagon last month, in which the government chose none of its three leading publicly traded defense contractors to do the work -- and picked privately held General Atomics and Anduril instead.\n\nFor Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop, the damage from this decision is substantial: At least $30 billion in lost potential revenues.\n\nEvery fighter pilot needs a good drone sidekick -- or even better, two sidekicks\n\nThe Air Force calls the contract in question its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, in which the aircraft that will be \"collaborating\" are piloted fighter jets, and their armed military drone sidekicks. All five of the named companies submitted drone designs to the Air Force for consideration. These five designs have now been winnowed down to two -- General Atomics' \"Gambit\" drone and Anduril's \"Fury\" -- and those two companies will now proceed to build prototypes for further evaluation.\n\nUSAF intends to then pick at least one of these prototypes to order sometime in fiscal year 2026, meaning a decision could happen as early as next year. (The Pentagon's fiscal year begins on October 1, 2025.)\n\nHow big is the CCA contract?\n\nWhoever wins that contest stands to inherit a real windfall of cash. As Breaking Defense reported in March, the Air Force wants to equip each of its 300 F-35 stealth fighter jets, plus a further 200 Next Generation Air Dominance fighters (a plane yet to be built) with two CCA drones each -- so 1,000 drones in all.\n\nWith an estimated $30 million production cost per drone, that makes CCA potentially a $30 billion program.\n\nAnd that's just to start with. BD notes that 1,000 drones is just the Air Force's initial requirement through \"the end of the decade.\" As CCAs are damaged or obsolesced, they will need to be replaced. Additionally, the U.S. currently possesses more than 450 F-35s, and intends to eventually fly nearly 2,500 of them.\n\nOver time, the CCA program could theoretically grow five times in size -- and five times in value, to as much as $180 billion -- just by equipping pairing its F-35s with two drone wingmen apiece.\n\nWhat it means for defense contractors\n\nIt's hard to overstate how bad this news looks for Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop. \"$180 billion\" -- that's a number roughly equal to the entire annual revenue of all three of these giant defense contractors, combined, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Admittedly, with the money spread out over six years, from now through 2030, the annual lost revenue is smaller, but it's still a pretty big number.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut all is not yet lost.\n\nGeneral Atomics and/or Anduril will supply CCA's initial requirement for 1,000 military drones. But as the Air Force noted, \"the companies not selected to build these production representative CCA vehicles, and execute the flight test program, will continue to be part of the broader industry partner vendor pool consisting of more than 20 companies to compete for future efforts, including future production contracts.\"\n\nSo it's entirely possible that Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop could still find work as subcontractors for whoever wins the first production contract(s). It's also possible that as the CCA program grows in size and expands beyond its initial requirements, the contract will be recompeted, and the publicly traded defense stocks will get a second bite at the apple.\n\nIn the meantime, however, momentum clearly favors the non-publicly traded defense contractors, General Atomics and Anduril. They've won the first round, and have pole position heading into the next round. At this point, investors' best bet on benefiting from the Pentagon's biggest-ever military drone program may be to hope for an Anduril IPO.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Northrop Grumman right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Northrop Grumman, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Northrop Grumman wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently clinched a modification contract for providing Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) requirements. The award has been offered by Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $221.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 30, 2028. The work related to this deal will be executed in Grand Prairie, New Boston, TX and Camden, AK.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. Spending on missile capabilities has increased, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT\u2019s MLRS Family of Munitions includes a variety of precision-strike rockets and missiles, with ongoing evolutionary development to meet the needs of today\u2019s warfighter. These are fired from both the MLRS M270 family of launchers and the HIMARS launchers.\n\nSuch remarkable features of the MLRS are likely to have boosted its demand significantly and, in turn, led to solid contract flows for Lockheed.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nThis should bode well for the missile industry, as evident from the Mordor Intelligence firm\u2019s report, which estimates\u00a0 the missile and missile defense systems market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nLMT\u2019s proficiency in missile manufacturing positions it favorably to capitalize on such market growth opportunities. Notably, Lockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control unit provides combat-proven air and missile defense systems as well as tactical missiles, apart from MLRS. These include Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile and a few more missile programs.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: General Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.\n\nGD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%.

        "title": "Northrop (NOC) Rewards Shareholders With 10% Hike in Dividend",
        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC recently announced that its board of directors approved a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to $2.06 per share, marking the 21st consecutive annual dividend hike. The revised quarterly dividend is payable on Jun 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 28.\r\n\r\nFollowing the recent hike, Northrop will now pay out an annual dividend of $8.24 per share. This represents an annual dividend yield of 1.75% based on its share price worth $470.69 as of May 15.\r\n\r\nNOC\u2019s annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&P 500 composite\u2019s yield of 1.27%. This signifies Northrop\u2019s strength in the business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payouts.\n\nCan Northrop Grumman Sustain Dividend Hikes?\n\nNorthrop Grumman has been consistently boosting its shareholder returns, as is evident by its dividend payout worth $1,052 million and $1,116 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Such a solid distribution strategy is generally buoyed by the steady performance of a company in generating sales and stable cash flows from operations.\r\n\r\nNotably, NOC recorded an 8.9% year-over-year increase in its sales in the last reported quarter. Its cash and cash equivalents came in at $3.06 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024, which improved 22.7% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s tally. Such solid cash balance and sales performances are likely to have enabled Northrop to enhance its dividend.\r\n\r\nAlong with dividend payments, NOC\u2019s management continues to increase shareholder value by repurchasing shares. In the first quarter of 2024, the company repurchased shares worth $1.19 billion, compared to $0.72 billion repurchased in the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to mention in this context that Northrop Grumman\u2019s business strength lies in the orders that it receives as one of the prime defense contractors, which converts into a robust backlog. Notably, the company exited first-quarter 2024 with a record backlog of $78.9 billion, backed by increasing demand and a rising global defense budget. This, in turn, shall boost NOC\u2019s sales growth and cash flow in the coming quarters.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, Northrop Grumman expects to generate sales in the band of $40.80-$41.20 billion for 2024, suggesting an increase of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure. The upside in sales should allow the company to fund notable dividend hikes in the days ahead.\n\nPeer Moves\n\nHere are some Defense companies that have been rewarding shareholders with impressive dividend payouts.\r\n\r\nIn October 2023, Lockheed Martin LMT approved a hike in its quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, indicating an increase of 5% from the prior payout. This marks the company's 21st consecutive year of raising its dividends.\r\n\r\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%.

        "title": "Curtiss-Wright (CW) Rewards Investors With Buyback, Ups Dividend",
        "content": "Curtiss-Wright Corporation CW announced that its board of directors approved a hike in its quarterly dividend to 21 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 5% from the prior payout. With the current hike, Curtiss-Wright will now pay out an annual dividend of 84 cents per share.\r\n\r\nThis signifies Curtiss-Wright\u2019s strength in the business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payouts.\n\nCurtiss-Wright Enhances Shareholders Value\n\nCurtiss-Wright\u2019s emphasis on returning cash to shareholders is backed by a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy and is buoyed by its ability to deploy capital effectively. Curtiss-Wright has been returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend hikes, thus highlighting consistency in sharing profits with its shareholders.\r\n\r\nAlong with dividend payments, Curtiss-Wright\u2019s management continues to increase shareholders\u2019 value by repurchasing shares. In the first three months of 2024, the company repurchased shares worth $12.2 million. The board of directors authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, increasing the total available authorization to $400 million under the repurchase program.\r\n\r\nSuch a stable return strategy is backed by its ability to generate strong revenues and free cash flows. Curtiss-Wright expects a surge of 5-7% in total sales and projects 8% to 11% growth in earnings in 2024. The company anticipates the free cash flow to increase in the range of 0-5% in 2024.\r\n\r\nAll three business segments of Curtiss-Wright are showing strong growth, which is boosting its earnings. Apart from organic growth, the acquisition of WSC Inc will further expand Curtiss-Wright\u2019s commercial nuclear business. It will create more opportunities for Curtiss-Wright to support its long-term financial goal and generate more revenues.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to expanding its business through organic methods and strategic acquisitions. The improving end market conditions and rising demand for the high-quality products offered by Curtiss-Wright will continue to generate profits, which can be utilized to increase shareholders' value in future periods.\n\nPeer Moves\n\nOther defense companies are also rewarding their investors through dividend payments and hikes at regular intervals. These defense majors are benefiting from a strong U.S. defense budget and a stable flow of contracts from the Pentagon.\r\n\r\nIn October 2023, Lockheed Martin LMT approved a hike in its quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share from the prior payout.\r\n\r\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. Lockheed\u2019s shares have inched up 1.6% in the past year.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 2024, Northrop Grumman Corp.  NOC announced that the board of directors declared a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $2.06 per share.\r\n\r\nNOC has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. NOC\u2019s shares have risen 4.9% in the past year.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 2024, RTX Technologies RTX announced an increase of 6.8% over the prior quarter's dividend amount.\r\n\r\nRTX has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%.

        "content": "Finding equities with the potential for steady, long-term development is crucial. These seven prospects span a variety of industries and offer solid arguments for long-term investment. Additionally, these businesses range from consumer staple giants to aerospace titans and healthcare juggernauts. They provide a fundamental combination of operational efficiency, strategic vision, and market supremacy.\n\nThe first demonstrates its durability and innovative capability in the healthcare industry with a balanced expansion plan spanning both innovative areas. Meanwhile, its steady rise in organic sales and volume expansion demonstrates the second one\u2019s capacity to handle market swings and hold onto market share.\n\nMoreover, within the aerospace industry, the third one\u2019s healthy order book and backlog demonstrate ongoing demand for its commercial aircraft. Similarly, the fourth one boasts financial indicators and outstanding success in obtaining foreign orders. Further, the fifth one is positioned as a strong force in the pharmaceutical industry thanks to its operational competence and leadership in therapeutic areas. Lastly, the final two candidates are chosen based on their emphasis on segment performance, growth strategies, and effective commercial execution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nValue Stocks to Buy and Hold: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nInnovative Medicine revenues for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) boosted by 2.5% globally to $13.6 billion, a remarkable 8.4% gain in the U.S. in Q1 2024. With the COVID-19 vaccine removed, operational sales growth increased by 8.3% globally and domestically. The market lead is attributed to growth in important brands, adoption of freshly released products, and vital gains in sales in specific therapeutic areas like oncology.\n\nAdditionally, global medical technology sales rose\u00a06.3% to $7.8 billion. Growth was fueled by the electrophysiology and cardiovascular divisions\u2019 strong performance and innovations in products like Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. The company\u2019s diversified portfolio and capacity to advance in the healthcare sector reflect the segments\u2019 balanced growth in innovative medicine and MedTech. Hence, this solidifies the company\u2019s competitive advantage and growth potential.\n\nLastly, Johnson & Johnson has a considerable focus on product advancement, reflecting the investment of\u00a0$3.5 billion (16.6% of sales) in research. Therefore, completing the Ambrx acquisition led to a strategic purchase of Shockwave Medical, illustrating the ability to grow through acquisitions and expand into high-growth sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) can expand its top-line from its current operations without the influence of forex, acquisitions, or diversions. This\u00a0is reflected in the company\u2019s continuous 3% organic sales growth. Despite changes in various locations,\u00a0Procter & Gamble kept or increased its volume across several product categories. Notably, volume growth in North America has been consistently positive over the previous four quarters, with increases ranging from 2% to 4%.\n\nMoreover, Procter & Gamble is expanding widely in several product sectors.\u00a0Certain\u00a0categories saw slower growth rates, while others \u2014 like oral care, home care, and grooming \u2014 saw double- or triple-digit increases in organic sales. Lastly, Procter & Gamble is expanding throughout a wide range of geographical areas rather than just one.\u00a0Important regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, LatAm, and North America, support organic sales growth and demonstrate the company\u2019s worldwide reach and market penetration tactics.\n\nValue Stocks to Buy and Hold: Boeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nIn Q1 2024, Boeing\u2019s (NYSE:BA) backlog included more than 5,600 commercial aircraft valued at $529 billion, reflecting a solid market for Boeing\u2019s goods and services. During the quarter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) recorded 125 net orders, with notable orders for the 737-10 and 777X types. The increase in the order book and backlog demonstrates Boeing\u2019s capacity to draw in and keep consumers despite obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, Boeing announced\u00a0$16.6 billion in sales for the quarter despite obstacles, including fewer 737 deliveries and the 737-9 grounding effects. Despite an 8% decrease in sales from the prior year, the company\u2019s resilience in generating significant income in the face of hardship is noteworthy. Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) experienced difficulties with its operational margin during the quarter, as it was negative 24.6%. However, the 737-9 grounding impact and fewer 737 deliveries were the\u00a0leading\u00a0causes.\n\nTo sum up, Boeing Defense & Space (BDS) delivered an operating margin of 2.2%, indicating a sequential increase with potential for improvement. Lastly, 60% of revenue came from the core business, which performed well in the mid-to-high single-digit profit range.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe defense budget for FY2024 benefits Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) by providing considerable money for several projects. The budget allots money for secret operations, hypersonics, and multi-year weapon acquisitions. Global demand for Lockheed Martin\u2019s goods is high, supporting the company\u2019s international expansion.\n\nFor instance, the business\u00a0received orders for F-35 aircraft from Singapore, Greece, and the Czech Republic. Moreover, Turkey may purchase 40 F-16s, demonstrating the company\u2019s global reach. Hence, these purchases strengthen Lockheed Martin\u2019s lead in the international military industry and boost top-line growth and diversity.\n\nSolid measures of the company\u2019s bottom line and financial standing include cash flow from operations, free cash flow, EPS, and segment operating profit. For instance, Lockheed Martin reported\u00a0$1.7 billion in segment operating profit on 10.1% margins. Finally, the company has the fundamental capacity to turn sales into cash efficiently, reflected in the $1.3 billion\u00a0in free cash flow it created during Q1 2024.\n\nValue Stocks to Buy and Hold: AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie\u2019s (NYSE:ABBV) fundamental capacity to continuously derive solid outcomes is based on its operational edge. The business delivered adjusted EPS of $2.31 for Q1 2024, 11 cents more than anticipated. The first quarter\u2019s total net sales of $12.3 billion beat forecasts by almost $400 million, indicating an operational growth rate of 1.6% again. Moreover, the business\u2019s 42.2% adjusted operating margin ratio shows effective cost control and operational effectiveness, bolstering profitability and future investments.\n\nFurther, strong performance across all therapeutic categories of AbbVie\u2019s primary medicines is a crucial factor in the company\u2019s commercial lead. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have become industry leaders in immunology, securing a sizable portion of the market and exhibiting strong revenue growth rates. The business\u2019s portfolios for neurology and cancer are expanding rapidly as well; drugs like Venclexta, Vraylar, and Botox Therapeutic are dominating their respective markets.\n\nIn short, AbbVie has a solid basis for long-term growth and global expansion because of its unique pharmaceutical offerings and\u00a0market-leading positions in several therapeutic categories.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) A photo of the CVS logo over the door of one of its stores.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn Q1 2024, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) derived $4.9 billion in  operational cash. The timing of Medicare payments is the reason for the weaker results against Q1 2023. However, the company\u2019s sharp cash flow indicates financial stability. Specifically, CVS Health has solid financial health, with around $1.9 billion in cash in Q1 and a focus on sustaining investment-grade ratings.\n\nIndeed, every segment of CVS Health focuses on meeting financial targets and carrying out its objectives in a way that demonstrates operational effectiveness. The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness division had a roughly\u00a03% rise in revenue,\u00a0primarily\u00a0due to the increase in prescription volume and vaccine contributions. Notwithstanding a roughly 10% decline in sales, the Health Services division saw growth in specialty pharmacy and the purchase of Oak Street Health and Signify Health.\n\nOn the other hand, innovative pharmacy formats and adopting biosimilars through Cordavis are just two examples of strategic initiatives. Therefore, these highlight CVS Health\u2019s forward-thinking mindset and dedication to generating growth and value.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had an 11% increase in operational revenue, excluding the contributions of Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Important products that helped boost income were Abrysvo, Eliquis, and Vyndaqel. In this case, the adjusted gross margin increased to 79.6% from Q1 of the previous year by 530 basis points. Revenue growth\u00a0was fueled\u00a0by Pfizer\u2019s strong, enterprise-wide commercial execution and concentration on\u00a0important\u00a0products and markets.\n\nMoreover, Pfizer\u2019s ability to gain market share and revenue through successful commercialization methods reflects its ability to launch new drugs like Abrysvo and maintain the growth of well-known blockbusters like Eliquis. Pfizer\u2019s oncology revenues increased operationally by\u00a019% in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. Notably, a portion of this rise was attributed to purchasing four Seagen in-line products.\n\nOverall, treatments like Xtandi for prostate cancer, Lorbrena for a specific type of advanced lung cancer, and Padcev for advanced bladder cancer are seeing rising demand and continuous growth.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in JNJ, CVS and PFE.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Secures a Contract to Aid F-35 Jet Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Aeronautics, recently secured a contract involving its F-35 fighter jet program. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $79 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure diminishing manufacturing sources of parts required for the production and sustainment of F-35 jets.\n\nThe work related to this contract will be executed in Fort Worth, TX. The award will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Foreign Military Sales customers and non-U.S. Department of Defense participants.\n\nSignificance of F-35 Jets\n\nLockheed\u2019s F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter jet in the world. It can securely connect high-tech platforms to share information across every domain,\u00a0 air, land, sea, space and cyber. The aircraft comes in three main variants, which are F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing), F-35B (short take-off and vertical landing) and F-35C (carrier-based).\n\nSuch remarkable features of this fighter jet are likely to have been ushering in solid contract wins for LMT, like the latest one. Consequently, the F-35 program remains a major revenue contributor for the United States\u2019 largest defense contractor.\n\nThe F-35 program was the largest revenue generator for Lockheed\u2019s Aeronautics business unit, accounting for 64% of the segment\u2019s net sales in 2023 and 26% of LMT\u2019s total consolidated net sales. Lockheed has delivered 992 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 373 jets in the backlog as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\nLMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets in 2024 and 156 in 2025 and beyond. This, along with the latest contract win, reflects the solid demand that the F-35 program enjoys in the combat jet market.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAmid the geopolitical tensions prevalent across the globe, nations are rapidly augmenting defense purchases to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to an increased demand for fighter jets, which form an integral part of a country\u2019s defense products. Per a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global military aviation market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.23% during 2024-2030.\n\nSuch projections indicate immense growth opportunities for prominent combat jet manufacturers like Lockheed. Its Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. The company\u2019s fighter jet portfolio includes C-130 Super Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and F-16 Fighting Falcon, in addition to F-35 jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nOther defense players that can gain from the expanding military aircraft market are Airbus SE EADSY, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC.\n\nAirbus\u2019 military aircraft consists of the A400M, C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. The company delivered a total of 1,783 military aircraft as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\nEADSY boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 8.2% from the top line reported in 2023.\n\nBoeing\u2019s product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more. In 2023, Boeing delivered 22 F/A-18s, nine F-15s, three T-7A Red Hawks and 11 P-8 models.\n\nBA has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Protect Your Wealth as the Economy Slows",
        "content": "For Q1 2024, GDP growth in the United States decelerated to 1.6% from 3.4% in the last quarter. There is no doubt that factors like high interest rates and geopolitical tensions have impacted growth. At the same time, inflation has been relatively stubborn, and potential rate cuts will likely be delayed. The markets are, therefore, likely to witness some nervousness. From an investment perspective, it\u2019s a good idea to look at blue-chip stocks to buy with a low beta.\n\nI must mention here that rate cuts are inevitable. However, a delay will likely translate into some correction for the broad markets. I would use any sharp decline as an opportunity to accumulate growth stocks. For now, the focus should be on blue-chip stocks for capital preservation.\n\nAlso, if the blue-chip stocks are undervalued, total returns can be healthy from these ideas in the next 24 to 36 months. The focus of this column is on blue-chip stocks to buy that have remained largely sideways in the last 12 months. A breakout seems imminent for these stock ideas.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense spending has been increasing at a robust pace. Further, the defense sector is immune to economic shocks. Even during the pandemic year, defense spending increased on a year-on-year basis.\n\nAmong blue-chip defense stocks,Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) looks attractive. The stock has remained sideways for the last 12 months and offers a dividend yield of 2.7%. Considering industry tailwinds and business developments, I expect LMT stock to break out on the upside. Even if the broad markets correct, the low-beta stock will likely remain resilient.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $159 billion. I expect order intake to remain robust, ensuring steady top-line growth. Besides growing defense allocation, investment in next-generation defense technology ensures a robust backlog.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Lockheed has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion for the year. That implies value creation through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nNewmont (NEM) Silver Stocks to Buy - Newmont Corp (NEM)\n\nNewmont (NYSE:NEM) has started trending higher recently. However, in the last 12 months, NEM stock has had negative returns of 8%. I see this as a golden accumulation opportunity, with gold trading at over $2,350 an ounce. With potential rate cuts due in the coming quarters, I expect a further rally for the precious metal.\n\nSpecific to Newmont, an investment grade balance sheet is the first reason to be positive. The company can pursue aggressive capital investments to boost production and benefit from higher realized gold prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of 2023, Newmont reported 128 million ounces of gold reserves and 155 million ounces of resources. A deep tier-one asset base will ensure a positive long-term trend in production and cash flows.\n\nLast year, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $2.8 billion. With a higher realized price, OCF will likely be around $3.5 billion for 2024. Robust cash flows will ensure healthy dividend growth. NEM stock already has an attractive dividend yield of 2.35%.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) sing with \"diesel,\" \"food mart\" and \"car wash\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is another quality blue-chip stock that trades at a valuation gap. The 3.99% dividend yield stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. While slower GDP growth is negative for oil demand, the possibility of rate cuts will trigger a rally in energy prices. I am, therefore, bullish on CVX stock.\n\nThere are multiple reasons to like Chevron. First, the company has an investment-grade balance sheet and reported a low net-debt ratio of 8.8% as of Q1 2024. Therefore, there is high financial flexibility to make aggressive capital investments.\n\nFurther, even with the relatively depressed oil prices, Chevron reported an operating cash flow of $6.8 billion for Q1. That implies an annualized OCF potential of $27 billion. However, if oil trades in the zone of $90 to $100 per barrel, OCF is likely to be above $35 billion. Chevron will, therefore, be positioned to pursue aggressive buybacks and deliver robust dividend growth.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN) Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at Snackviken\n\nSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn general, healthcare stocks have been ignored in a post-pandemic world. This is a good opportunity to accumulate quality blue chips trading at a valuation gap. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock has been sideways in the last 12 months and looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 18. The low-beta stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.51%.\n\nFor Q1 2024, AstraZeneca reported stellar numbers. Revenue increased by 19% on a year-on-year basis to $12.7 billion. Further, earnings per share growth was impressive at 21%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company has a pipeline of 182 molecular entities. With an attractive late-stage pipeline, robust growth will likely sustain. To put things into perspective, the company had 30 phase three trials last year. Of this, there are 10 potential blockbuster opportunities. The impact will likely be seen on growth in the next 24 to 36 months.\n\nAnother positive catalyst for AstraZeneca is its strong geographical presence. In emerging markets, revenue growth for Q1 was 26% on a year-on-year basis. Excluding China, year-on-year growth was 40%.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO) Mining cart in a silver, copper, and gold mine representing VOXR Stock.\n\nSource: TTstudio / Shutterstock\n\nRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a commodity major that looks undervalued and has a low beta. RIO stock has trended higher by 12% in the last 12 months but remains attractive at a forward P/E ratio of 9.5. Considering the valuation, the downside for this 7.34% dividend yield stock is capped. On the other hand, potential rate cuts can be a catalyst for a rally in industrial commodities and will benefit Rio Tinto.\n\nTalking about fundamentals, Rio Tinto has delivered an average annual free cash flow of $10.6 billion in the last five years. Besides attractive shareholder returns, Rio has a strong balance sheet and flexibility to make aggressive growth investments.\n\nThis is important since Rio Tinto has been focusing on investing in energy transition metals. That includes the likes of copper, lithium and aluminum \u2014 among others. While the iron ore business remains the cash cow, Rio will likely be well diversified in the next five years.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn important point to note is that the consumption sector is the primary growth driver for the U.S. economy. Within that sector, retail spending is a key component. Therefore, I would hold quality retail stocks in the portfolio regardless of the economic scenario. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is a low-beta stock worth holding amidst economic uncertainty.\n\nI must add here that there is a possibility of multiple rate cuts in the next 12 to 18 months. The lower cost of money will boost retail spending, and Walmart will be a beneficiary.\n\nFor Q4 2024, Walmart reported healthy revenue growth of 5.7% on a year-on-year basis to $173.4 billion. It\u2019s worth noting that the e-commerce segment revenue increased by 23% globally. Walmart surpassed $100 billion in annual revenue from the e-commerce business. Clearly, the company has built a strong omni-channel presence. Further, Walmart International sales increased by 13.5% in the last financial year. With a presence in big markets like China and India, I expect sales growth to remain robust.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) It's Time to Wake Up and Smell the Coffee on Starbucks Stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock has been in a correction mode with a downside of 21% year-to-date. The decline has been triggered by Starbucks\u2019 warning on cautious consumer spending. At the same time, the company lowered its full-year guidance.\n\nHowever, with the negatives discounted in the stock, it\u2019s a good time to accumulate. SBUX stock offers a dividend yield of 3% and looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.4.\n\nFor Q2 2024, Starbucks reported a 2% decline in net revenue on a year-on-year basis to $8.6 billion. Comparable sales declined in U.S. and international markets. However, it\u2019s worth noting that as of Q2, 61% of the company\u2019s stores were concentrated in the U.S. and China.\n\nStarbucks has ample headroom for expansion in other emerging markets in the next 5 to 10 years. The weakness in SBUX stock is an opportunity to gradually accumulate for dividends and steady returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Escalating geopolitical tensions have put the aerospace and defense (A&D) industry at a pivotal juncture. With global security concerns at the forefront of national agendas, governments have increased spending on advanced weaponry, sophisticated surveillance systems and cutting-edge military technologies. As a result, Wall Street has been paying close attention to aerospace and defense stocks to buy.\n\nA recent study by Deloitte highlights a robust outlook for the sector.\u00a0 Fueled by global developments, the U.S. defense budget has climbed 3.2% year-over-year (YOY) to a staggering $842 billion for 2024.\u00a0Another study projects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% for the A&D sector worldwide from 2023 to 2030. Thus, this article introduces three aerospace & defense stocks to buy to capitalize on this dynamic industry.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe global A&D behemoth Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) operates through four main segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems and Space. Its products include fighter jets, combat vehicles, missile defense systems, satellites and next-generation hypersonic weapons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn late April, the defense technology company reported mixed financial results for the first quarter. Net sales reached $17.2 billion, reflecting a 13.9% YOY increase. But net earnings declined 11.8% compared to the previous year and came in at $1.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) stood at $6.33, a 1.6% drop compared to the previous year quarter.\u00a0Investors noted management has allocated $700 million into research and development (R&D) with the aim focusing on innovation and technology leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, Lockheed Martin won the competitive bid for the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program. This development positions Lockheed Martin as the prime contractor responsible for delivering the nation\u2019s most advanced homeland missile defense capability to date. Many analysts point out Lockheed Martin\u2019s ability to secure new contracts, particularly in high-growth areas like space and advanced missile systems.\n\nLMT stock has gained 2.8% year-to-date (YTD) and currently trades near 1-year highs. Yet, its valuation remains compelling at 18.2 times forward earnings and 1.67 times sales. In addition, shares currently have a robust 2.69% dividend yield. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $491.47 for LMT, suggesting potential upside of 5% from current levels. Interested investors can wait for a pull back towards $460 to initiate positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) US tank General Dynamics (GD) Abrams M1A1 in military polygon in the exercise Platinum Lynx 16 on Galati, Romania, 11 December 2015\n\nSource: PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top stock pick among aerospace & defense stocks to buy is General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), whose operations span across four major segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. Meanwhile, its products include combat vehicles, nuclear-powered submarines, business jets, communication systems and munitions.\n\nWall Street was pleased with the recent earnings results as revenue climbed to $10.7 billion, marking an 8.6% increase from the previous year. Net earnings reached $799 million, a 9.5% surge compared to the prior-year quarter. This strong performance translated to diluted EPS of $2.88, representing a 9.1% YOY growth. General Dynamics\u2019 profitability metrics are equally impressive. A gross profit margin of over 15% and an operating margin of over 9% indicate efficient management and strong pricing power.\n\nIn late March, Gulfstream Aerospace, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics, announced a significant milestone for its business aviation segment. The all-new Gulfstream G700 has successfully achieved Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification. Management has already announced the first customer deliveries of the Gulfstream G700. Additionally, the increased demand for Combat Systems products, particularly from European and U.S. markets, and the expansion in the Marine Systems segment driven by U.S. Navy\u2019s needs, are pivotal growth areas.\n\nSo far in 2024, GD stock has appreciated a robust 15% and is currently trading at all-time highs and offering a 1.92% dividend yield. Shares are changing hands at 20.4 times forward earnings and 1.9 times sales. And Wall Street remains optimistic for the prospects of GD stock with a 12-month median price forecast of $316. Such an up move could potentially mean an almost 7.5% increase in GD price.\n\niShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) A photograph of two jet fighters flying above clouds. defense stocks. Defense Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRounding out our discussion on A&D investments is the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:ITA) an industry-focused fund. Since its inception in May 2006, net assets have grown close to $6.4 billion.\n\nAmong ITA\u2019s 34 holdings, the top 10 names comprise about three-quarters of the fund. This concentration of heavyweights allows investors to tap into the performance of industry leaders like RTX (NYSE:RTX), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin, Howmet Aerospace (NYSE:HWM), and TransDigm Group(NYSE:TDG). These companies are the backbone of the sector, driving innovation and shaping the future of A&D.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, ITA has gained 7.1%, and it offers a dividend yield of 0.82%. Meanwhile, the fund\u2019s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 31.2x. Given the geopolitical environment and growing importance of aerospace and defense, we\u2019re bullish on the ITA, but would consider buying after a pullback towards the $125 level. Finally, interested investors should also note the annual expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently clinched a contract involving High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). The award has been provided by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $861.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by May 31, 2026.\u00a0 Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will manufacture HIMARS and provide the supporting services associated with it.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT\u2019s HIMARS is the most technically advanced, affordable and sustainable artillery solution that provides cutting-edge technology on an indigenous platform. HIMARS provides unmatched long-range mobile firepower to support Joint All-Domain Operations. It can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System family of munitions.\n\nSuch remarkable features of the HIMARS are likely to have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that Lockheed has already increased the production capacity of HIMARS from 48 per year to 60 per year.\n\nGrowth Prospect\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks. As the demand for missiles is on the rise, so is the demand for missile launchers like HIMARS.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the missile and missile defense systems market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nLMT\u2019s proficiency in manufacturing missiles and associated missile launchers, particularly that of HIMARS, positions it favorably to capitalize on the growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market. The fact that Lockheed Martin remains on track to double the production of its HIMARS to 96 per year by the end of 2024, makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for this product, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company\u2019s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year growth in its top line in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: General Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It is a key supplier of major strategic and tactical missile programs ranging from warheads to missile housings, structural components to solid rocket motor cases.\n\nGD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%.

        "title": "Space Race Superstars: 3 Stocks Reaching for the Stars and Beyond",
        "content": "As we venture further into 2024, the rapidly evolving space industry presents an array of tantalizing investment prospects. With governments and private enterprises intensifying their space pursuits, savvy investors are setting their sights on the stars. In this article, we\u2019ll talk about three space stocks to buy that I feel have the best value in the market right now.\n\nThe UN-Portugal policy symposium on the \u201cManagement and Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\u201d highlighted the urgent need for inclusive and sustainable space governance, especially in light of recent advancements in the private space sector.\n\nThis, to me, is a bullish sign, as it indicates the space industry is rapidly developing and becoming a key talking point. Although we may be in the very earliest stages of witnessing its commercialization, I also feel this is where we will see the most opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, with that being said, here are three space stocks to buy for investors this year.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) provides launch services and space systems solutions, including satellite deployment and spacecraft design.\n\nThe Electron small orbital launch vehicle, the Photon satellite platform and the upcoming Neutron launch vehicle are central to its portfolio. I see the most promise coming from its Neutron vehicle, slated to significantly improve its EBITDA over the long run.\n\nFor 2024, Rocket Lab provided an optimistic outlook. The company expects earnings to grow, with EPS forecasted to improve from ($0.41) to ($0.23) per share. Analysts maintain a Moderate Buy rating on RKLB stock, with an average price target indicating potential upside. Revenue for Q1 2024 was $92.8 million, up 69% year-over-year.\n\nDespite some launch failures over the past year and other operational hiccups, I am still firmly bullish on RKLB, given its tiny valuation at just $4.16 per share at the time of writing. That makes it one of those space stocks for investors to consider.\n\nAstra (ASTR) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American aerospace company Astra Space on screen in front of web page.. ASTR stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstra (NASDAQ:ASTR) focuses on providing cost-effective launch services for smaller satellites. The company\u2019s innovative rocket designs aim to make space more accessible.\n\nIn 2023, Astra reported significant financial losses, including a GAAP net loss of $29.7 million for Q3 and adjusted EBITDA losses across multiple quarters. Revenues were relatively low, with Q2 revenue at $0.71 million and Q3 revenue at $0.26 million.\n\nFor 2024, however, Astra is focusing on enhancing its launch capabilities and expanding its product offerings. The company aims to increase revenues and improve margins by optimizing operations and securing new contracts. Analysts predict earnings growth, with projected EPS improving from ($2.40) to ($1.80) per share for upcoming quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nSatellite constellations are becoming increasingly popular, with around 2.6 billion of the world\u2019s population without internet access. That\u2019s because it\u2019s physically impossible to connect some remote regions around the world, and satellites offer a solution to this. They are also used as a form of secure communication networks for governments and corporations.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a leading defense and aerospace company involved in numerous space projects, including satellite development and space launch systems.\n\nThe company has significantly ramped up its production of small satellites, responding to increased demand from defense and intelligence agencies. Lockheed Martin recently opened a new small satellite assembly facility near Denver, Colorado, capable of manufacturing 180 spacecraft per year.\n\nOne of Lockheed Martin\u2019s notable projects is the collaboration with NASA on its Artemis program. The company is also developing a human-rated Moon rover as part of NASA\u2019s Lunar Terrain Vehicle Services (LTVS) contract.\n\nThe broader point of why I like LMT is that it\u2019s one of the leading defense stocks in the world, supplying many NATO and neutral countries with the tools they need to defend themselves. It has a great total return history, outpacing the S&P 500 over the long-term charts, and has a strong 3-year dividend growth rate of 7.43%.\n\nThat makes it a diversified pick, with the space industry being a separate growth headwind in addition to the rising geopolitical tensions that fuel LMT\u2019s valuation upwards.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with LLAP.\n\nRelease Date: May 14, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nTerran Orbital Corp reported a significant backlog of $400 million, indicating strong future revenues primarily from Lockheed Martin over the next 18-24 months. The company has successfully delivered 10 satellites for the Transport Layer Tranche 0 to Lockheed Martin and the Space Development Agency in just 26 months from contract award, showcasing improved production speed. Terran Orbital Corp is expanding its manufacturing capabilities, with a new 94,000 square foot facility expected to open by Q1 2025, enhancing their capacity to meet growing demand. The company has over $25 billion of identified pipeline across 140 programs, demonstrating potential for substantial growth and diversification in customer base and market segments. Terran Orbital Corp has strengthened its vertical integration, controlling more of its supply chain, which is crucial for maintaining schedule and cost efficiencies in satellite manufacturing.\n\nNegative Points\n\nRevenue for Q1 2024 was down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable EAC adjustments on a single program caused by subcontractor challenges. The company reported a gross loss of $6.2 million for Q1 2024, compared to a gross loss of $1.4 million in the previous year, with adjusted gross loss worsening due to subcontractor issues. Terran Orbital Corp is experiencing delays in some programs, which could impact short-term revenue recognition and cash flow. The strategic review process initiated due to an acquisition proposal from Lockheed Martin is still ongoing, creating uncertainty about the company's future direction. Despite efforts to become EBITDA positive, the company faced a negative adjusted EBITDA of $28.2 million in Q1 2024, indicating ongoing profitability challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you provide details on the value per satellite in the new contract with Lockheed compared to the previous awards? A: Marc Bell, CEO of Terran Orbital, explained that the tracking layer satellites in the new contract are more sophisticated than those in the previous transport layer, justifying a higher price per satellite due to the increased complexity and stability required for their payloads.\n\nQ: What is the expected revenue ramp for this year, especially with the backlog and upcoming deliveries? A: Marc Bell mentioned that with nearly 50 space vehicles being delivered this year, significant revenue ramp-up is expected particularly in Q3 and Q4 as deliveries continue throughout the year.\n\nQ: How are you progressing towards profitability, especially considering the ramp-up in the second half of the year? A: Marc Bell indicated a potential for achieving quarterly profitability by Q4, depending on the execution of incoming programs. He highlighted that increased automation and internal production are improving yield and reducing dependency on subcontractors, which supports the drive towards EBITDA positivity.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the cash flow conversion of the $400 million non-robotic backlog over the next 18 to 24 months? A: Marc Bell clarified that cash flow from the backlog is milestone-based and varies significantly between programs, with some having front-loaded and others back-loaded cash flows.\n\nQ: What are the implications of the EAC adjustments and delayed revenue recognized this quarter? A: Mathieu Riffel, Acting CFO, explained that the negative EAC adjustments are mainly timing issues within their accounting model. He assured that the total contract value remains fixed and the revenue will be recognized in future periods.\n\nQ: Given the upcoming election year, are there any concerns about the impact on Terran Orbitals government contracts? A: Marc Bell expressed confidence in the stability of their core DoD work, noting that these programs are essential and cost-effective compared to other available options, thereby likely to be less affected by potential political shifts.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) business segment recently clinched a modification contract for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS). The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $332 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Oct 20, 2027.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT\u2019s GMLRS is a combat-proven, highly accurate, all-weather, precision-guided rocket system, which is capable of delivering precision strikes farther than many conventional weapons. Notably, the company\u2019s MLRS Family of Munitions includes a variety of precision-strike rockets and missiles, with ongoing evolutionary development to meet the needs of today\u2019s warfighter. Impressively, GMLRS rockets boast a reliability rate of more than 98%.\n\nSuch remarkable features of the GMLRS are likely to have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that more than 60,000 GMLRS rockets have been produced to date.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nThis should bode well for the missile industry, as evident from the Mordor Intelligence firm\u2019s projection, which suggests a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period for the missile and missile defense systems market.\n\nLMT\u2019s proficiency in missile manufacturing, particularly that of GMLRS, positions it favorably to capitalize on such growth opportunities. The fact that Lockheed Martin is working with the U.S. Army to increase GMLRS production capacity to 14,000 per year in 2025 makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for its GMLRS product, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company\u2019s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year growth in its top line in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components.

        "title": "How Intuitive Machines 'totally disrupted' the economics of flying to the moon",
        "content": "Intuitive Machines (LUNR) made history in February when it became the first private space company to touch down on the surface of the moon.\n\nNow, it\u2019s looking to accelerate the development of the lunar economy.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance, Intuitive Machines CEO and co-founder Steve Altemus said the company\u2019s cost structure and ability to streamline lunar missions ultimately place it in the driver\u2019s seat in a global race to develop the moon.\n\n\u201cWe designed and developed a mission to the moon at a price point that was roughly $118 million and did it in about four years,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cWe have totally disrupted the industry in terms of the economics of flying to the moon.\u201d The Intuitive Machines IM-1 Lunar Lander, Nova-C, is on display on Oct. 3, 2023, before it is shipped to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for launch on a Falcon 9 rocket. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nIn its inaugural IM-1 mission, Intuitive Machines' Odysseus moon lander successfully reached the lunar surface in February, but its weeklong mission faced serious challenges after the vehicle tipped on its side when landing. That cut short Intuitive Machines' full mission, although the NASA research equipment on board successfully sent back data from its experiments.\n\nIntuitive Machines is now looking ahead to its second lunar mission, IM-2, which is scheduled for November. Altemus said the company conducted a 30-day review of its first mission to improve its technology for the second round.\n\n\u201cWe can improve our ability to land 20 times with precision,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cThe south pole [of the moon] is going to require that. That's what we do continually \u2014 refine for that pinpoint accuracy.\u201d\n\nIntuitive Machines is among a handful of private startups developing a low-cost transportation system to the moon with funding from NASA. The agency\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program set aside $2.6 billion for more than a dozen companies to carry NASA\u2019s research to the lunar surface along with payloads for commercial customers.

(MARK FELIX/AFP via Getty Images) (MARK FELIX via Getty Images)\n\nThe missions are laying the groundwork for NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon. The first crewed mission under Artemis has been delayed to 2025 as Lockheed Martin (LMT), the lead contractor, develops the Orion spacecraft that will carry the astronauts.\n\nIntuitive Machines, meanwhile, is positioning itself to own end-to-end operations between the Earth and the moon, strategically placing bets on the critical infrastructure needed to enable longer stays on the lunar surface.\n\nThe company recently won a $30 million contract from NASA to develop a lunar terrain vehicle that will shuttle Artemis astronauts around on the moon. Intuitive Machines has also developed a Lunar Data Network that enables communication and data relay services for spacecraft.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs a company, our vision is to deliver space systems to the surface with our family of landers to do command and control and navigation in and around the moon so that it enables surface operations,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cI believe Intuitive Machines is the only company that's got all three pieces.\u201d\n\nNASA estimates human activity in the region of space between the Earth and the moon will exceed all activity since 1957 in the next decade alone. That potential prompted the White House to develop its first science and technology strategy to \u201csupport responsible, peaceful, and sustainable exploration.\u201d\n\nThe relative success of its first mission has provided a lift to Intuitive Machines. The company saw its cash balance increase to $54.6 million in the first three months of the year after an institutional investor exercised warrants. The company also raised $10 million through equity and said it had \u201csufficient capital for the near term.\u201d\n\nIntuitive Machines stock is up roughly 138% year to date. But the company, which came to the public markets through a SPAC, has been more vulnerable to big swings on any perceived risks compared to competitors that have opted to remain private.\n\n\u201cWhen you go de-SPAC, there's quite a bit of volatility in your stock as you move from maybe retail investors to more institutional investors,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cSo as the company matures, I see a greater contribution of investment from institutional investors, which should provide some stability to the stock in the long term.\u201d\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "10 Weakest Militaries in Asia",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 10 weakest militaries in Asia. You can skip our detailed analysis of the current defense spending trends in the continent, and head over directly to the 5 Weakest Militaries in Asia.\n\nAccording to the latest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global military spending registered its steepest rise since 2009, increasing 6.8% from 2022 to total $2.44 trillion in 2023. This was the ninth successive year in which the world\u2019s military spending had risen, with all major regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia witnessing an increase.\n\nIn 2023, $560 billion was spent on defense across Asia, increasing 3.6% year over year. Of this, $411 billion was incurred in East Asia, which represented 73% of the continent\u2019s total defense spending. On the other hand, defense spending in South Asia was recorded at $98.2 billion, whereas $47.8 billion was expensed in Southeast Asia. The least expenditure in the continent was noticed in Central Asia, where only $1.8 billion was spent during the year.\n\nDefense expenditure in Asia has risen by more than 40% since 2014, with a sharp rise being observed in East Asia and South Asia \u2013 the two major flashpoints of military and diplomatic escalation in the continent. Countries in the region have gotten embroiled in an arms race, and the resultant surge in demand for weapons has created a boom in the global armaments industry.\n\nAccording to defense experts, the threat of China invading and annexing Taiwan is greater today than it ever was, with Beijing steadily stockpiling its arsenal for the last few decades. In response, the United States, in order to protect its own and Taipei\u2019s interests, has ramped up its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Washington has also recently approved sales of weapons worth billions of dollars to Taiwan. In March last year, in a move that soured the relationship further between the United States and China, the American government approved selling new weapons worth $619 million to Taiwan, which included 200 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and 100 AGM-88B HARM missiles, among others. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) are the primary contractors of the deal.\n\nThe arms race between South Korea and North Korea also does not seem to have an end in sight any soon. Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime has been a thorn in Seoul\u2019s side, and has launched over a hundred ballistic missiles over the last two years, signaling Pyongyang's intentions of not relinquishing its weapons of mass destruction. South Korea in response increased its defense spending by 3.6% last year compared to 2022, incurring $47.9 billion in 2023, which included an order placed in September for 25 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) valued at $5.06 billion. According to Yonhap News Agency, Seoul had already acquired another 40 F-35s from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) between 2019 and 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe South China Sea continues to remain a point of contention between regional and global powers, with Beijing laying a claim over nearly all of its strategic waterways, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines have overlapping claims as well. South Asia also remains hot, as Pakistan and India continue to pile up their arsenals in what is termed as the most weaponized region in the world. The arch-rivals regularly launch newer, improved missiles, and showcase their latest military equipment in parade ceremonies and drills to flaunt their war capabilities to the other.\n\nCountries in the Middle East have also been heavily upgrading their military capabilities to enhance national security, especially after the jolts faced by the Arab Spring in the early 2010s. Saudi Arabia has remained the fifth largest defense spender in the world for two successive years now \u2013 2022 and 2023 \u2013 with over $75 billion incurred in military spending in each of these years, including a $3 billion agreement with the United States to purchase 300 MIM-104E Patriot missiles from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX). There are also reports about RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) moving the production of parts involved in manufacturing the Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAll said and done, while defense spending continues to expand significantly in Asia, the increase has not been even within the continent, as was evident from the breakdown of military spending in Asia shared earlier in the discussion. There are regions and countries in the continent where defense expenditure, sizes and inventories of militaries remain small, because of which, these are some of the weakest militaries in Asia.\n\nWe now take a look at these countries. If interested, you can also read our article on the 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Asia. 10 Weakest Militaries in Asia\n\niurii/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered three broad weighted categories to rank the weakest militaries in Asia. These include the strength of ground troops in terms of manpower, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles (30%), size of the economy and defense spending (30%), and aerial and naval capabilities (40%). Weighted scores for each metric were aggregated to get a final overall score. The 10 weakest militaries in Asia are ranked in descending order of these scores.\n\nData related to military equipment and defense spending has been sourced from the Global Firepower Index 2024, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and other independent news agencies of various countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was consulted for figures related to countries\u2019 GDP.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Lebanon\n\nGDP (2023): $21.78 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $241.3 million\n\nActive Manpower: 60,000\n\nTanks: 204\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 4,522\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 81\n\nNaval Assets: 69\n\nOverall Score: 9.0\n\nWe begin with Lebanon, which has the weakest military in the Middle East, and one that faces an asymmetric threat from non-state actors, including militant groups. A major challenge impeding the potential of the Lebanese military is its shortage of logistical equipment and a lack of financial resources. The country\u2019s air force also remains weak, with only nine combat aircraft; the rest of the fleet comprising attack helicopters and transport aircraft.\n\n9. Armenia\n\nGDP (2023): $24.54 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $1.33 billion\n\nActive Manpower: 57,500\n\nTanks: 221\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 736\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 64\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 7.6\n\nNext on our list is Armenia. The country has significantly increased its manpower and defense spending in wake of the armed conflict with Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020. Despite that Armenia\u2019s military capabilities remain limited, and the results in the conflict in which it ended up losing territory reflects its weaknesses. The country has a small fleet of battle tanks and military aircraft, and has no naval assets. It has a force of 57,500 personnel when it comes to active military manpower.\n\n8. Laos\n\nGDP (2023): $14.24 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $40 million\n\nActive Manpower: 100,000\n\nTanks: 130\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 1,880\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 34\n\nNaval Assets: 45\n\nOverall Score: 6.4\n\nLaos is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia, with a population of 7.5 million people. It has the weakest military in Southeast Asia and one of the weakest in Asia, with only 130 battle tanks, 34 military aircraft, and 45 naval assets. It has a sizable number of active military personnel and a large fleet of armored fighting vehicles; however, these are not sufficient to help the country to shrug off its reputation of being a weak link when it comes to military strength in the continent.\n\n7. Nepal\n\nGDP (2023): $41.34 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $418.9 million\n\nActive Manpower: 95,000\n\nTanks: 0\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 2,216\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 15\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 6.2\n\nNepal is one of the weakest militaries in Asia with no battle tanks and naval assets. Its fleet of armored fighting vehicles is the country's only recognizable area of military strength. The military aircraft fleet of Nepal includes no combat aircraft, with all 15 of these aircraft either being transport jets or combat helicopters.\u00a0Nepal relies heavily on India for most of its military equipment.\u00a0Due to the country\u2019s weak military, there has been growing concern in India over Nepal becoming a hub for cross-border spying against Delhi\u2019s security interests.\n\n6. Afghanistan\n\nGDP (2023): $14.94 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $278.3 million\n\nActive Manpower: 80,000\n\nTanks: 20\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 6,555\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 17\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 5.8\n\nAfghanistan is sixth on our list of the weakest militaries in Asia. After the collapse of Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government in 2021, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) were replaced by the Taliban\u2019s Islamic Emirate Armed Forces as the national military of the country. Most of the military equipment in Afghanistan\u2019s inventory, especially the armored fighting vehicles, is what was left behind by the American-led coalition. Afghanistan has no naval assets, only 17 military aircraft, and 20 battle tanks, according to the Global Firepower Index. There has been a scarcity of information that comes out Kabul after the Taliban takeover, but rough estimates suggest the group has about 80,000 fighters that now form part of the national military.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Weakest Militaries in Asia.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Weakest Militaries in the World 10 Weakest Militaries in Europe 10 Weakest Militaries in Africa\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Weakest Militaries in Asia is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Lockheed Martin is US$649 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$469 suggests Lockheed Martin is potentially 28% undervalued The US$487 analyst price target for LMT is 25% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Model\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.22b US$6.16b US$6.41b US$7.09b US$7.16b US$7.25b US$7.37b US$7.51b US$7.66b US$7.82b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x10 Analyst x6 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.34% Est @ 1.65% Est @ 1.87% Est @ 2.02% Est @ 2.13% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4%  US$5.8k US$5.4k US$5.3k US$5.5k US$5.2k US$5.0k US$4.8k US$4.6k US$4.4k US$4.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$50b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.8b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (6.4%\u2013 2.4%) = US$197b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$197b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$106b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$156b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$469, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.883. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Aerospace & Defense industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "title": "Palantir Stock (NYSE:PLTR): Should You Buy the Post-Earnings Dip?",
        "content": "Palantir stock (NYSE:PLTR) dipped by about 16% after its Q1 earnings report, prompting me to ponder whether this downturn presents a buying opportunity. Notably, Palantir showcased yet another quarter of solid revenue growth, promising client base expansion, and strong profitability metrics. That said, concerns persist regarding the stock\u2019s elevated valuation. Consequently, despite my belief in Palantir\u2019s long-term prospects as a shareholder, I maintain a neutral stance towards the stock at present and don\u2019t believe the dip is worth buying.\n\nAccelerating Growth Driven by Government and Commercial Clients\n\nPalantir Q1\u2019s marked a period of accelerating growth, driven by solid performance in both the company\u2019s Government and Commercial segments. Revenues landed at $634.4 million, up 20.8% year-over-year. This implies an acceleration from last year\u2019s growth of 17.7% and the third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth on a sequential basis. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at both Palantir\u2019s segments in Q1 to better understand what precisely drove this result.\n\nGovernment Revenue Fueled by Domestic Acceleration, International Expansion\n\nStarting with Palantir\u2019s Government segment, which accounted for about 53% of its Q1 revenue mix, total revenue growth in this segment was 16%, at $335 million. This growth was mainly driven by accelerating revenues in the domestic division and rapid international expansion. Source: Palantir\u2019s Q1-2024 Investor Presentation\n\nDomestically, revenue growth accelerated in Q1 in the U.S. Government business, increasing by 12% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter to $257 million. This compares against a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q4, with Palantir\u2019s software becoming increasingly critical for the U.S. Government in today\u2019s unstable geopolitical environment. Palantir\u2019s International Government division further compounded the segment\u2019s growth, with its revenues rising by 33% to $79 million.\n\nAn important milestone in Q1 was that the U.S. Army granted Palantir an exclusive prime contract worth over $178.4 million to develop a next-generation targeting node as part of the TITAN program. This marks a historic moment for Palantir, as it became the first software company ever to win a prime contract for a hardware system. This effectively positions Palantir to establish itself as a prime vendor akin to giants like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) or Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) in the field of weapons and aerospace products.\n\nCommercial Revenue Surges Following Rapid Client Base Expansion\n\nTransitioning to Palantir\u2019s Commercial segment, revenues experienced another notable surge, driven by the increasing uptake of its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) and the solid expansion of the company\u2019s clientele.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a prior update on Palantir, I emphasized the pivotal role of Bootcamps in bolstering Palantir\u2019s corporate customer base. Palantir organizes these hands-on workshops to showcase the capabilities of its software, notably its AIP. Successful demonstrations should allow potential clients to realize the value proposition Palantir offers and potentially commit to a contract.\n\nThis strategy seems to be working extremely well for the company. In Q1, Palantir added 41 net new customers in its U.S. Commercial segment (see the image below). This marked a 69% increase in Palantir\u2019s customer count year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter. Palantir also recorded a significant acceleration here, compared to the 8% quarter-over-quarter growth of last year\u2019s Q1. Source: Palantir\u2019s Q1-2024 Investor Presentation\n\nRapidly Improving Profitability, But Valuation Concerns Remain\n\nPalantir\u2019s strong revenue growth has gradually allowed the company to record improving unit economics, thus improving its profitability metrics. The company\u2019s adjusted operating margin landed at 36%, up from 34% in the previous quarter and 24% last year, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of expansion. It led to an adjusted operating income of $226.5 million, up 81% compared to last year. Further, Palantir\u2019s adjusted free cash flow came in at $149 million, also achieving a noteworthy margin of 23%.\n\nWith additional cash flowing into Palantir\u2019s balance sheet, the company ended the quarter with a record cash position of $3.87 billion, all while maintaining a debt-free status. Nevertheless, investors should still take into account the underlying risks involved in Palantir\u2019s current valuation, no matter how impressive its profitability metrics and robust financial standing are.\n\nAt the end of the day, Palantir is still trading at approximately 65 times this year\u2019s expected earnings per share (EPS) and 54 times next year\u2019s expected EPS. Its revenue growth acceleration and ongoing margin expansion may allow the company to grow into these multiples sooner rather than later. Still, Palantir\u2019s investment case offers a notably lower margin of safety compared to last year\u2019s levels, even after the post-earnings dip\u2014and this is coming from a shareholder with high hopes.\n\nIs PLTR Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe present sentiment on Wall Street seems bearish, even after Palantir\u2019s post-earnings share price decline. According to Wall Street, Palantir Technologies features a Moderate Sell consensus rating based on two Buys, five Holds, and six Sells in the past three months. At $19.67, the average\u00a0PLTR stock price target suggests 4.5% downside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell PLTR stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Mariana Perez\u00a0from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities, with an average return of 61.42% per rating and a 92% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTo sum up, Palantir\u2019s Q1 report reflects an ongoing acceleration in revenue growth, evident in both its Government and Commercial segments. With Governments relying increasingly on Palantir\u2019s software during an unstable geopolitical environment and corporate clients gradually realizing the capabilities of AIP, Palantir\u2019s long-term prospects appear more promising than ever.\n\nHowever, the persistent concern over the stock\u2019s valuation cannot be overlooked. While Palantir shows promise for long-term investors, and I am one of them, a neutral stance on the stock seems reasonable, given its elevated valuation multiples. Accordingly, I wouldn\u2019t buy the stock on this dip if I were looking to initiate a position in Palantir. I\u2019d rather wait for a potentially more attractive entry point.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has gained 3.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nLockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 points to a change of -5.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.31 indicates a change of +7.8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $69.5 billion and $72.29 billion estimates indicate +2.9% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "10 Weakest Militaries in Europe",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 10 weakest militaries in Europe. You can skip our detailed analysis on defense spending patterns in the continent and head over directly to the 5 Weakest Militaries in Europe.\n\nGlobal military spending reached a record-high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, according to latest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), having grown 6.8% compared to 2022 \u2013 the steepest rise in defense expenditure since 2009. This is the ninth successive year in which global military spending has increased.\n\nIn Europe, military spending totaled $588 billion during the year, which represented nearly one-fourths (24%) of all global defense expenditure. The amount was 16% higher than in 2022, and 62% of the value a decade ago in 2014. Defense spending has surged in the continent after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with both countries substantially increasing military expenditure, and others in the region also racking up their defenses with war returning to Europe after decades of peace.\n\nOf the total spent in Europe in 2023, $407 billion, or 69%, were incurred on defense expenditure in Central and Western Europe, with the United Kingdom being the largest spender in the subregion, followed by Germany. While, $181 billion were spent on military procurements in Eastern Europe, with Ukraine spending a whopping $64.8 billion on defense, which helped it climb from 11th spot in 2022 to become the eighth largest military spender in the world in 2023.\n\nAnother recent report by SIPRI highlighted a 94% increase in arms imported by European countries between 2019-2023 compared to 2014-18, with the United States being the origin of 55% of all of these imports in the last five years. The spike in defense spending over the last couple of years has created a boom in the aerospace and armaments manufacturing industry in the United States.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) registered revenues of $67.6 billion last year, which was 2.4% higher than in 2022. The company\u2019s net earnings also rose $5.7 billion compared to the previous year. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stock price has risen 18.3% since the Russia-Ukraine war. On the other hand, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) also posted a revenue of $68.9 billion, which was 3% higher year-on-year. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)\u2019s sales also expanded 7% than figures in 2022, to total $39.3 billion last year.\n\nSeveral European countries that are part of NATO have actively been pursuing the procurement of advanced military equipment to further enhance national security, and also meet the treaty\u2019s expectation of member states committing at least 2% of their GDP on defense. You can read more on this in NATO Spending by Country Per Capita: Top 15 Countries. Germany in December 2022 sealed a $8 billion agreement with the United States, under which it would procure 35 F-35 fifth-generation fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Moreover, in March this year, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) won a $1.2 billion deal to build Patriot air and missile defense systems for Berlin, which would significantly boost the country\u2019s air defense.\n\nStory continues\n\nLate last year in November, Hungary also received the delivery of two units of the NASAMS air defense system it had ordered from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace. The American defense giant is also reportedly in negotiations with Safran, a French aerospace company, over the latter potentially purchasing flight control units from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).\n\nMoreover, air defense capabilities of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania were bolstered last year with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) fielding Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) systems in these countries, under a $14.3 million fund provided by Washington. Seeing a sustained demand for its offerings, the company has projected a revenue of $41 billion in 2024 \u2013 4.3% higher than 2023. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has also teamed up with Danish company Terma on delivering electronic warfare training in Northern Europe.\n\nKathy Warden, CEO and Chairman of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shared the following remarks in the company's Q1 2024 Earnings Call:\n\n\"Growing global demand for our capabilities led to an exceptional 9% year-over-year increase in Q1 sales, driven by growth in all four of our sectors. The productivity and cost efficiency measures we\u2019ve been implementing are gaining traction, and our program performance in the quarter was strong resulting in segment operating margin dollars increasing by 10%. Operating profit expansion along with the lower share count helped to drive 15% EPS growth. Overall, our first quarter performance was in line with, or better than our expectations, and we are reaffirming our 2024 company level guidance. Global demand for our products continues to be robust, fueled by rising defense budgets and our market position. We\u2019re pleased that an agreement was reached on the U.S. fiscal year 2024 defense budget, which includes support for our key programs, and represents a 6% growth in investment accounts over 2023. In March, the administration released the 2025 defense budget, and future year\u2019s defense program, or FIDGET. And these also were consistent with our expectations. We continue to see robust support for our program portfolio in areas that include nuclear modernization, microelectronics, advanced weapons, and space.\"\n\nThat being said, despite the increase in demand for weapons in Europe, defense spending has not been even across the continent, with several countries being a weak link as Moscow continues to pile up the pressure. We now take a look at some of those countries, focusing on the 10 weakest militaries in Europe.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 10 Weakest Militaries in Africa. 10 Weakest Militaries in Europe\n\nDavid Acosta Allely / Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThree broad categories of weighted metrics have been considered to rank the weakest militaries in Europe. 50% weightage was assigned to the strength of ground troops, which consisted of analyzing their manpower, tank fleet, and armored fighting vehicles; 30% was allotted to aerial and naval capabilities, while the remaining 20% was represented by the size of their economy and defense spending in 2023. Weighted scores for each metric were then aggregated to get a final overall weighted ranking score. The 10 weakest militaries in Europe are listed in descending order of their overall scores. Please note that Iceland has been excluded from the list since it does not have a standing military.\n\nData related to military equipment has been sourced from the Global Firepower Index 2024, while International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) were consulted for fresh figures related to the sizes of countries\u2019 economies and their defense spending in 2023.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the weakest armed forces in Europe.\n\n10. Latvia\n\nGDP (2023): $46.67 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $1.04 billion\n\nManpower: 17,250\n\nTanks: 0\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 1,544\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 7\n\nNaval Assets: 18\n\nOverall Score: 7.80\n\nLatvia spent 2.27% of its GDP on defense last year, and is among only eleven NATO member countries to meet the organization\u2019s 2% spending goal. Despite that, it is a weak link when it comes to military strength. The country has no battle tanks, and has an extremely small fleet of military aircraft and naval assets. When it comes to manpower, Latvia has a little over 17,000 active personnel.\n\n9. Slovenia\n\nGDP (2023): $68.39 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $907.5 million\n\nManpower: 7,300\n\nTanks: 55\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 1,502\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 38\n\nNaval Assets: 2\n\nOverall Score: 6.95\n\nSlovenia has one of the weakest militaries in Europe, with a manpower of only 7,300 active troops, while its navy has only two vessels \u2013 one being a patrol ship, and the other a patrol boat. The country has a sizable number of armored fighting vehicles, but that alone is not sufficient to meet Slovenia\u2019s military requirements. It also has 55 battle tanks and 38 military aircraft.\n\n8. North Macedonia\n\nGDP (2023): $15.8 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $266.6 million\n\nManpower: 9,000\n\nTanks: 23\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 2,156\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 20\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 6.00\n\nNext on our list of the weakest militaries in Europe is North Macedonia, which joined NATO in March 2020. The country spent a meager $266 million on defense expenditure last year, which represented about 1.7% of its GDP. North Macedonia has only 9,000 troops, 20 military aircraft, and no naval assets, according to the Global Firepower Index. The only area of recognizable military strength for the country is its large fleet of armored fighting vehicles.\n\n7. Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nGDP (2023): $26.94 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $216.7 million\n\nManpower: 12,770\n\nTanks: 91\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 450\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 24\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 5.85\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s armed forces are among the weakest in the world, especially when it comes to naval strength and active manpower. The country\u2019s fleet of battle tanks and military aircraft also remain small. There is some hope, however, that stable economic growth over the last few years, coupled with military assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and the United States may help the country shrug off its reputation of being a weak link militarily in Europe.\n\n6. Albania\n\nGDP (2023): $23.03 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $397.6 million\n\nManpower: 6,600\n\nTanks: 40\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 976\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 19\n\nNaval Assets: 19\n\nOverall Score: 5.60\n\nAlbania is in sixth spot in our list, with an extremely small military force of 6,600 active personnel. Moreover, all 19 of the country\u2019s military aircraft comprise attack helicopters, whereas Albania\u2019s naval assets are mostly patrol crafts. Albania faces persistent threats of domination from powerful countries in its neighborhood due to its small size and a weak military.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Weakest Militaries in Europe.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Asia\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Weakest Militaries in Europe is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. SPR reported a first-quarter 2024 adjusted loss of $3.93 per share, which came in much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 44 cents per share. The loss also widened from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported loss of $1.69 per share.\r\n\r\nBarring one-time adjustments, Spirit AeroSystems recorded a GAAP loss of $5.31 per share compared with a loss of $2.68 in the prior-year period.\n\nHighlights of the Release\n\nTotal revenues of $1.70 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 billion by 1.7%. However, the top line rose 19% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher production activities of the company\u2019s commercial programs as well as higher Defense and Space revenues.\n\nSpirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nSpirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. Quote\n\nSpirit AeroSystems\u2019 backlog at the end of the first quarter totaled $49 billion, up from the prior quarter\u2019s $37 billion.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nCommercial Segment: Revenues in the segment increased 18.1% year over year to $1.36 billion. The upside was driven by higher production across most of its programs.\r\n\r\nThe segment\u2019s operating loss was $484.9 million compared with the operating loss of $45.5 million in the year-ago period. The deterioration can be attributed to higher changes in estimates as well as the results of the changes implemented in the product verification process in March 2024.\r\n\r\nDefense & Space: The segment recorded revenues of $250.8 million, up 33.1% year over year, driven by increased activity of development and classified programs as well as the Sikorsky CH-53K and FLRAA programs.\r\n\r\nThe unit\u2019s operating income increased 67.7% to $32.2 million from $19.2 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by higher activities of classified programs.\r\n\r\nAftermarket: This segment\u2019s top line improved 1.5% year over year to $95.9 million, driven by higher spare part sales.\r\n\r\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit decreased 10.4% year over year to $17.2 million owing to lower maintenance, repair and overhaul activity.\n\nOperational Highlights\n\nTotal operating costs and expenses rose 46.1% year over year to $2.23 billion due to the higher cost of sales as well as selling, general and administrative expenses.\r\n\r\nSPR\u2019s operating loss in the first quarter of 2024 totaled $527.6 million compared with the operating loss of $95.1 million in the prior-year quarter. This deterioration was mainly due to unfavorable changes in estimates.\n\nFinancial Position\n\nAs of Mar 28, 2024, Spirit AeroSystems had $352 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $823.5 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe long-term debt as of Mar 28, 2024 totaled $3.99 billion compared with $4.02 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nCash outflow from operating activities amounted to $415.6 million during the first quarter of 2024 compared with cash outflow of $46.2 million recorded a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank\n\nSpirit AeroSystems currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRecent Defense Releases\n\nRTX Corporation\u2019s RTX first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 by 8.9%.

        "title": "If EPS Growth Is Important To You, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Presents An Opportunity",
        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nHow Quickly Is Lockheed Martin Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Lockheed Martin has grown EPS by 4.0% per year. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Lockheed Martin achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 5.2% to US$70b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Lockheed Martin's future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Lockheed Martin Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Lockheed Martin has a market capitalisation of US$112b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Holding US$64m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Lockheed Martin Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Lockheed Martin is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Lockheed Martin , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "10 Weakest Militaries in Africa",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 10 weakest militaries in Africa. You can skip our detailed analysis on defense spending patters in the continent and head over directly to the 5 Weakest Militaries in Africa.\n\nGlobal military spending increased 6.8% from 2022 \u2013 the steepest rise since 2009 \u2013 to reach a record-high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, according to latest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). This is the ninth successive year of growth in defense expenditure, with spending increasing across all regions of the world.\n\nThe United States continued to remain the largest military spender in the world, having spent a whopping $916 billion on defense in 2023, representing 37% of the world\u2019s total defense expenditure. China, Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia retained their positions in the top five, while Ukraine climbed from 11th spot in 2022 to become the eighth largest spender on defense, having spent $64.8 billion in 2023. Combined, the top ten countries accounted for 74% of the world\u2019s total defense expenditure during the year.\n\nIn Africa, the military spending totaled $51.6 billion in 2023, which was 22% higher than in 2022, and represented 2.1% of the global defense expenditure. Of this, $28.5 billion was spent in North Africa, with Algeria and Morocco together accounting for 82% of the military spending in the region. This spike was driven by Algiers\u2019 defense bills soaring 76% compared to 2022 to reach $18.3 billion, made possible by an increase in demand for Algerian gas exports amid sanctions against Russia. On the other hand, $23.1 billion was incurred on defense by states in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 20% of the amount attributed to Nigeria. As is evident from these numbers, while defense spending continues to rise each year, the increase is not even. Neither across continents, nor within.\n\nArms Procurement in Africa\n\nRussia is Africa\u2019s largest arms trade partner, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the country\u2019s exports to the continent increasing 23% between 2016 and 2020, compared to 2011 and 2015. This is seen by analysts as a strategic move by Moscow to facilitate trade and soft power in Africa, which would enable Russia to build a presence at NATO\u2019s southern flank. That being said, sanctions against Moscow in recent years have created an opening for Chinese armament manufacturers as well, with the Asian giant exporting over $2 billion worth of military supplies to Sub-Saharan Africa between 2010 and 2021. Arms sales of the United States to the subregion during this period were estimated to be $473 million, according to the Atlantic Council.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe situation is strikingly different in North Africa, where American defense companies play a much more active role, driven by the decades-long arms race between Algeria and Morocco, coupled with President Sisi's quest for Egypt to become a major regional power. Washington in April last year, approved the potential sale of HIMARS and related equipment to Rabat under a $524 million deal, with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) being among the major contractors of the deal. The Pentagon also approved selling Joint Stand Off Weapons to Morocco for a cost of $250 million, with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) being the primary contractor of the project.\n\nOn the other hand, Cairo has also been looking to upgrade its defense systems with advanced American air radars. In January 2022, the US approved the sale of three L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) SPS-48 land-based radars for $355 million to Egypt, which would offer the African nation jamming capabilities and help it detect even extremely small targets. A year prior to this in February 2021, it was reported that Egypt also received the Rolling Airframe Missiles manufactured by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) under a $197 million agreement.\n\nMoreover, elsewhere in the African continent, the United States has actively begun donating military equipment to several countries in the region to aid them in combating terrorism and crime. In 2014, the United States gave away two Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft to Mauritania to help the country in its fight against maritime time and terrorist groups. Both the aircraft were manufactured by Cessna, owned by Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), and were valued at $21 million each at the time.\n\nMore recently in 2021, the American government donated a Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) C-130 aircraft to Niger to use in operations related to humanitarian assistance and mobility of UN peacekeeping missions. The C-130 is one of the top-selling tactical aircraft in the world, and has been continuously manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) since its first flight in 1954.\n\nLast year, the United States announced an $80 million grant to donate four Bell 412EP helicopters built by Bell Helicopters, a subsidiary of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), to the Zambian Air Force. Under the grant, the US was also to provide three years of service and training for the helicopter. The Zambian government thanked Washington for the donation, and stated that the helicopters would assist the country in enhancing regional security, and in supporting UN peacekeeping missions in the continent.\n\nAlso see 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa. 10 Weakest Militaries in Africa\n\nMethodology\n\nSeveral weighted metrics have been considered to rank the weakest militaries in Africa. These include capabilities of ground forces (40%) determined by manpower, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles; naval and aerial strength (30%), and economic potential and defense spending (30%). Weighted scores for each metric were aggregated to get an overall weighted score. The 10 weakest militaries in Africa are listed in this article in descending order of their weighted scores.\n\nMilitary-related data has been sourced from our recent article, 15 Weakest Militaries in the World, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was consulted for figures related to GDP in 2023.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the weakest militaries in Africa.\n\n10. Senegal\n\nGDP (2023): $31.14 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $345 million\n\nManpower: 17,000\n\nTanks: 0\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 1,104\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 27\n\nNaval Assets: 4\n\nOverall Score: 12\n\nSenegal has one of the weakest militaries in Africa, with only 17,000 active military personnel. The country\u2019s armed forces have no battle tanks, and only four naval assets. Its fleet of 27 military aircraft comprises four special mission aircraft and 13 combat helicopters, among others, with Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)\u2019s Bell 206 being one of the main choppers operated by the country. The only area of strength for Senegal\u2019s military is its large fleet of armored fighting vehicles. That being said, the size of the country\u2019s economy was measured at over $31 billion in 2023, with a GDP growth of 5.3% during the year. If this positive economic trend continues, Senegal can certainly look to increase defense spending to upgrade its military.\n\n9. Burkina Faso\n\nGDP (2023): $20.78 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $434 million\n\nManpower: 12,000\n\nTanks: 0\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 1,112\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 21\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 10.9\n\nBurkina Faso\u2019s military is in the news currently for the alleged massacre of over 200 civilians in two villages in February this year, as part of an ongoing campaign against civilians suspected of abetting Islamist militant groups. The country has been under military rule since 2022, and has one of the weakest armed forces in the world with no battle tanks and naval assets, and a manpower of a mere 12,000 troops. Despite that, the military holds firm control over national politics.\n\n8. Mauritania\n\nGDP (2023): $10.36 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $194 million\n\nManpower: 31,500\n\nTanks: 0\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 1,000\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 23\n\nNaval Assets: 5\n\nOverall Score: 10.6\n\nMauritania is next on our list of the weakest militaries in Africa, with manpower being its only recognizable area of strength. Much of the country\u2019s military equipment is old and outdated, and of French and Soviet origin. The country has no battle tanks, and possesses only five naval assets. Mauritania has 23 military aircraft, of which four are Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano light attack aircraft. The Air Force also has two Cessna 208 special mission aircraft it received from the United States in 2014.\n\n7. Gabon\n\nGDP (2023): $19.32 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $280 million\n\nManpower: 6,500\n\nTanks: 0\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 848\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 23\n\nNaval Assets: 10\n\nOverall Score: 10.2\n\nA military coup in Gabon last year ended the 56-year rule of the Bongo family over the former French colony, in a fresh blow to Paris\u2019 interests in the region. The country relies heavily on French military assistance, which has since then been put to a halt following the collapse of Bongo\u2019s government. This series of events is likely to further weaken Gabon\u2019s military, which is already one of the weakest militaries in Africa, with an active manpower of only 6,500 troops. The country has no tanks, and a mere ten naval assets. Its 23 military aircraft include 6 Mirage F1 combat jets, 1 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) C-130H, and 2 C-295 transport aircraft, among other aircraft.\n\n6. Madagascar\n\nGDP (2023): $15.76 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $110 million\n\nManpower: 13,000\n\nTanks: 386\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 430\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 4\n\nNaval Assets: 8\n\nOverall Score: 9.4\n\nMadagascar is in sixth spot in our list of the weakest militaries in Africa. The country spent only $110 million on defense expenditure in 2023, and has a manpower of 13,000 active troops. One area of comparative strength for the military on paper appears to be a sizable fleet of battle tanks, but in reality, most of the equipment is long outdated. Working conditions for soldiers in Madagascar\u2019s military also remain poor, with personnel reporting demotivation due to lower wages.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Weakest Militaries in Africa.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Countries that will have the Most Powerful Militaries by 2030 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Weakest Militaries in Africa is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What Boeing's delayed rocket launch means for the company, according to Intuitive Machines CEO",
        "content": "Boeing (BA) delayed the launch of its Starliner space capsule Monday after identifying a faulty oxygen relief valve just hours before liftoff.\n\nEarly Tuesday, NASA said the launch, which was expected to carry two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), would be rescheduled to \u201cno earlier than Friday, May 10.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delay allows teams to complete data analysis on a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank of the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage and determine whether it is necessary to replace the valve,\u201d NASA said in a statement.\n\nThe launch of the CST-100 Starliner on board the United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, was supposed to mark Boeing\u2019s first crewed flight and a big step forward for a firm plagued by design flaws and a botched flight attempt.\n\nBut mission teams scrubbed the launch two hours before liftoff. NASA astronauts Barry \u201cButch\u201d Wilmore and Sunita Williams were set to spend a week on the International Space Station while the Starliner remained docked.\n\n\u201cIt has been a real challenge for them to get their spacecraft ready to go and safe for our astronauts,\u201d said Intuitive Machines (LUNR) founder and CEO Steve Altemus, speaking at the Milken Institute\u2019s Global Conference. \u201cWhile they've worked through some very difficult technical challenges, what's the future of that program? I'm not quite sure how it will persist over time and what kind of investment it'll take.\u201d NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore exit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a mission dress rehearsal on Friday, April 26, 2024. (Frank Micheaux/NASA via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAerospace has 'fundamentally changed'\n\nThe delay marked the latest setback for a company already grappling with quality control and safety issues in its aviation business, including a slew of problems linked to its 737 Max models.\n\nBoeing began developing Starliner in 2014 after winning a $6.8 billion NASA contract along with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Since then, SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon capsule has flown nine crewed flights for NASA and four flights with private astronauts, while Boeing has failed to keep up.\n\nBoeing's first attempt to reach the ISS was unsuccessful after its onboard clock was set incorrectly, causing the computer to fire the capsule\u2019s engines prematurely. The program has incurred more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns.\n\nAltemus, whose company has partnered with Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) to develop a lunar terrain vehicle for NASA, said Boeing's challenges highlight a fundamental shift within the new space economy.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to a broader issue in the industry about what's the role of the traditional prime contractor or the strategic aerospace company,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the environment of NASA and the way they're doing nontraditional procurements to buy goods and services for the Artemis program has fundamentally changed the landscape and disrupted strategic aerospace.\u201d\n\nStory continues Photographers capture the Boeing Starliner capsule atop an Atlas V rocket as it is rolled out to the launch pad on May 4, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP Photo/Terry Renna) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe space economy is in the midst of a rapid evolution, driven by SpaceX. Borrowing from a playbook established by founder Elon Musk, firms are moving quicker, building bigger, and slashing costs in the process, bringing a tech startup-like mentality to space exploration.\n\nMuch of that growth has been limited to rockets and satellites, but NASA has added fuel by leaning on private companies to take on the risk of further space exploration to the moon and beyond.\n\nAltemus said that the push to move faster and be more flexible has put smaller companies like Intuitive in the driver\u2019s seat. NASA has already awarded the company more than $100 million to develop an end-to-end lunar delivery service in addition to developing the lunar terrain vehicle.\n\nIn February, Intuitive became the first commercial company to reach the surface of the moon, although its lunar vehicle Odysseus tipped on its side upon landing, altering the mission.\n\n\"The government is asking us as commercial companies to share the risk,\" Altemus said. \"Sometimes with the larger strategic aerospace companies, their boards and their shareholders are not comfortable with that risk posture, where a smaller, more nimble, agile company can maybe work around those financial risks and be successful.\"\n\n\"I think the companies that can figure this out, the ones who can manage with these non-traditional procurements, will be the tier one aerospace companies of the future,\" he added.\n\nCatch more of Yahoo Finance's coverage at the 2024 Milken Institute Global Conference.\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Sell in May Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Although geopolitical tensions are high and defense spending is generally on the rise globally, not all defense stocks companies will benefit. Some defense contractors may face challenges. Those include supply chain disruptions, labor shortages or reputational risks that could impact performance and prices.\n\nMoreover, the defense industry is heavily dependent on government contracts and budget allocations. And those can be highly unpredictable and subject to political shifts. Companies that rely heavily on a few key contracts or have a narrow product portfolio may be more vulnerable to changes in government priorities or spending cuts.\n\nMore specifically, some defense stocks have a mix of weakening fundamentals and overvalued natures. Let\u2019s explore some of those that investors should sell this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRTX Corporation (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is known for its aerospace and defense products. Quite recently, it faced a significant setback with a defect discovered in 1,200 of its jet engines. This issue requires grounding and inspection of the engines, which could impact the company\u2019s financial performance and reputation.\n\nImportantly, RTX did very well in its Q1 results. Also, the Raytheon defense division showed strong profit margin growth. However, the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney divisions experienced margin declines. This could be a concern, as these two divisions account for a significant portion of RTX\u2019s revenue.\n\nSome analysts\u2019 commentary leans into RTX being currently overvalued. It trades at high multiples compared to both its historical averages as well as the median for its peer universe. So although a solid stock, a pullback may be needed, and it could be primed for a retracement.\n\nThe Boeing Company (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft. stocks to buy and sell related to Boeing\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has also experienced challenges. The company\u2019s stock performance has been underwhelming compared to market expectations. Furthermore, BA has faced production issues and other operational difficulties.\n\nBad news has been abound for the stock, which is perhaps one of the most impactful media disasters of the last decade for a company. Also, last month, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) indicated that there could be more bad news forthcoming.\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Calhoun mentioned that 737 production will be \u201cslow and lumpy\u201d in Q2 as the company works through challenges over the next 60 days. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Brian West also indicated that Boeing is slowing near-term production of the 787 Dreamliner. The company is planning to return to five per month later in the year. So, these production issues could impact the company\u2019s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, Northcoast Research cut its rating for BA stock to sell from neutral. It cites channel checks that point to a lower build rate for the 787 Dreamliner than Boeing\u2019s claim of five per month. This discrepancy could indicate an underlying problem not yet shared with investors.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile traditionally a strong performer, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has recently been subject to concerns over its valuation and the sustainability of its growth.\n\nLMT stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in 2021 and 2023, despite outperforming in 2022. This inconsistent performance, especially during a period when many other stocks have provided better returns with less risk, may make LMT less attractive to some investors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, despite strong revenue growth, Lockheed Martin\u2019s consolidated operating margin declined by 170 basis points year-over-year (YOY) to 11.8% in Q1. Lower operating margins led to a decrease in earnings per share compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nLike RTX, I think that LMT is a great stock but its valuation is too rich due to its own success. Its high valuation makes it more vulnerable to market and systemic risks than others. Therefore, it should be worth waiting on the sidelines before considering adding LMT to one\u2019s portfolio. And similar to RTX, it also trades at high valuation multiples to its historical performance. This prompts caution.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Global military spending for 2023 touched record highs of $2.44 trillion. On a year-on-year basis, defense spending increased by 6.8%. That does not come as a surprise, as there are multiple points of geopolitical friction globally. It\u2019s also likely that defense spending will continue to increase at a healthy pace through the decade. From an investment perspective, it\u2019s a good opportunity to consider exposure to some of the best defense stock picks.\n\nIf we look at some top defense companies, the order backlog has been swelling. Further, companies are investing in next-generation defense technology. A swelling backlog implies clear revenue and cash flow visibility. Investment in R&D will ensure that growth remains healthy as new technology replaces the existing in the coming years.\n\nTherefore, the overall outlook for the defense sector is positive. Even with macroeconomic headwinds, I don\u2019t see a slowdown in defense spending. As a matter of fact, global defense spending increased even during the pandemic years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this overview, let\u2019s discuss three defense stock picks poised to surge higher on the back of potential growth acceleration.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is my top pick from the defense sector. After remaining sideways for the last 12 months, LMT stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17.9. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 2.73%. With business progress remaining positive, I am bullish on a strong breakout for LMT stock.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Lockheed reported a strong order backlog of $159 billion. That provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For the current year, Lockheed has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion. FCF will likely continue to swell in the coming years on the back of healthy order intake.\n\nAn important point to note is that Lockheed is investing in next-generation defense technology. That includes hypersonics and next-generation interceptors, among others. Investment in research and development will ensure that Lockheed is ahead of the curve. Further, with expanding sales to allies, the addressable market is significant.\n\nLeonardo DRS (DRS)\n\nAmong the emerging defense stocks,Leonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) is worth considering for multibagger returns. DRS stock has trended higher by 35% in the last 12 months. However, the growth stock remains attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26.8. With a swelling order backlog, I expect growth to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs an overview, Leonardo DRS is a provider of defense technologies. For the last financial year, the company clocked revenue and EBITDA of $3 billion and $378 million respectively. It\u2019s worth noting that as of Q1 2024, Leonardo reported an order backlog of $7.8 billion. On a year-on-year basis, the backlog swelled by 84%. If the order intake remains robust, there is a strong case for a healthy upside in EBITDA and cash flows.\n\nI must add here that Leonardo has been consistently investing in R&D. Last month, the company won the 2024 Herschel Award for the \u201cdevelopment of a groundbreaking cooled infrared sensor that unlocks the ability for advanced military and scientific capabilities.\u201d\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX) has witnessed a healthy rally of 20% for year-to-date. However, the stock remains attractively valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 19.3. Therefore, I expect further upside for this 2.49% dividend yield defense stock.\n\nFor Q1 2024, RTX reported healthy sales growth of 12% on a year-on-year basis to $19.3 billion. For the same period, the company reported a healthy order backlog of $202 billion. That included a $125 billion backlog from the commercial segment and $77 billion from defense. A robust backlog provides clear revenue visibility.\n\nAn important point to note is that the order intake for Q1 2024 was $25 billion. If that pace of intake sustains, organic sales growth will likely remain robust. I must add that RTX has guided for free cash flow of $5.7 billion for the year. That provides ample flexibility to invest in operational modernization and technological innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "*\n\nHouthi, Ukraine sea drone attacks reshape ocean warfare\n\n*\n\nU.S. Navy's sea drone program in D.C. funding quagmire\n\n*\n\nPentagon wants sea drones to counter China's naval power\n\n(Adds Switchblade in paragraph 22)\n\nBy Joe Brock and Mike Stone\n\nMay 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy's efforts to build a fleet of unmanned vessels are faltering because the Pentagon remains wedded to big shipbuilding projects, according to some officials and company executives, exposing a weakness as sea drones reshape naval warfare.\n\nThe lethal effectiveness of sea drones has been demonstrated in the Black Sea where Ukraine has deployed remote-controlled speed boats packed with explosives to sink Russian frigates and minesweepers since late 2022.\n\nYemeni-backed Houthi rebels have employed similar vessels against commercial shipping in the Red Sea in recent months, albeit without success.\n\nThese tactics have caught the attention of the Pentagon, which is incorporating lessons from Ukraine and the Red Sea into its plans to counter China's rising naval power in the Pacific, Pentagon Spokesman Eric Pahon told Reuters.\n\nIn a signal of the Pentagon's intent, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced an initiative in August - named Replicator - to deploy hundreds of small, relatively cheap air and sea drones within the next 18-24 months to match China's growing military threat.\n\nThis public show of commitment masks years of hesitation by the U.S. Navy to build a fleet of unmanned vessels despite repeated warnings this was the future of maritime warfare, according to interviews with a dozen people with direct knowledge of the U.S. sea drone plans, including Navy officers, Pentagon officials, and sea drone company executives.\n\nTwo Navy sources and three executives at sea drone manufacturers said the biggest impediment to progress has been a Department of Defense (DoD) budget process that prioritizes big ships and submarines built by legacy defense contractors.\n\n\"At some point, you hit the D.C. problem,\" said Philipp Stratmann, CEO at Ocean Power Technologies (OPT), a New Jersey-based firm that supplies the U.S. Navy with the WAM-V, an autonomous surface drone.\n\n\"You hit the fact that there is a military industrial complex that has the best lobbyists and knows exactly how the money flows and contracting works in the DOD.\"\n\nA Navy spokesperson said it \"acquires capabilities based on fleet demand signals\", referring to the messages headquarters receive from commanders at sea.\n\nThe Navy has a budget of $172 million this year for small and medium-sized underwater sea drones, falling to $101.8 million in 2025, the spokesperson said. That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nREPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon\n\nsaid the Switchblade\n\n-600, an aerial loitering munition made by AeroVironment Inc , was the first weapon publicly confirmed to be included in the Replicator initiative. The program's first tranche also includes undisclosed maritime surface products, other aerial drones and counter-drone systems (c-UAS), the Pentagon said.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget.\n\n\"We hear the demand signal \u2026 but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule.\n\nThe U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters.\n\nSwarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation.\n\n\"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\"\n\nThe Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters.\n\nMISSILE TEST\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy.\n\nThe use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors.\n\nSaildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti.\n\nThe drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine.\n\nThese programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.

        "title": "Curtiss-Wright (CW) Beats Q1 Earnings, Hikes '24 Sales View",
        "content": "Curtiss-Wright Corporation CW shares rose 4.4% to reach $268.17 on May 3 following the release of its first-quarter 2024 results. \r\n\r\nThe company reported first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.99, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 by 13.7%. The bottom line also improved 34.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $1.48.\n\nCurtiss-Wright Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCurtiss-Wright Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Curtiss-Wright Corporation Quote\n\nOperational Performance\n\nIn the quarter under review, the company\u2019s net sales of $713.2 million went up 13% year over year. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $665 million by 7.2%.\r\n\r\nThe company reported adjusted operating income of $100 million in the first quarter, up 23% year over year. The operating margin expanded 110 basis points (bps) to 14%.\r\n\r\nCurtiss-Wright\u2019s total backlog at the end of the first quarter was $3.1 billion, which increased by 7% from the 2023-end backlog figure. This improvement can be attributed to higher demand from both aerospace and defense, as well as commercial markets.\r\n\r\nNew orders of $901 million rose 26% year over year, driven by the strong demand for the company\u2019s defense electronics and naval defense products.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nAerospace & Industrial: Sales in this segment improved 8% year over year to $219.3 million. The upside was driven by higher commercial aerospace market sales, backed by increased OEM sales of actuation and sensor products and surface treatment services on narrowbody and widebody platforms. Also, higher revenues from the aerospace defense market driven by increased actuation development on various fighter jet programs benefited the segment\u2019s sales growth.\r\n\r\nThe operating income improved 3% to $27.5 million. However, the operating margin contracted 60 bps to 12.5%.\r\n\r\nDefense Electronics: Sales in this segment increased 31% year over year to $211.7 million. This rise was driven by increased sales of CW\u2019s embedded computing equipment on various fighter jets, unmanned aerial vehicles and helicopter programs. Also, robust demand and higher sales of tactical battlefield communications equipment, along with increased OEM sales of avionics and electronics on various platforms, have contributed to this segment\u2019s sales growth.\r\n\r\nThe operating income increased 106% to $48.1 million. The operating margin expanded 830 bps to 22.7%.\r\n\r\nNaval & Power: Sales in this segment increased 6% year over year to $282.1 million, driven by higher sales contributions from the arresting systems equipment and higher revenues from the Columbia-class submarine. Moreover, increased commercial nuclear aftermarket sales supporting the maintenance of operating reactors in the United States and Canada are likely to have aided this segment\u2019s sales growth.\r\n\r\nThe segment's operating income decreased 7% to $35.2 million.

        "title": "Want Decades of Passive Income? 3 Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever.",
        "content": "Technology gets a lot of attention on Wall Street, but the world still runs on industries that physically make and move the goods we use daily. Some industrial companies have been doing this for decades and are poised to continue for decades.\n\nTheir dependable and steadily growing nature has amassed terrific dividend track records. Their solid fundamentals and competitive advantages allow them to share profits with shareholders and continue running excellent businesses.\n\nHere are three industrial stocks you can confidently buy and receive dividends from for decades.\n\n1. Caterpillar\n\nMachinery company Caterpillar(NYSE: CAT) might be next to the word industrial in the dictionary. It's an industrial in every sense of the word. Caterpillar makes a variety of large, earth-moving machinery for construction, mining, energy, and transportation. Think bulldozers, dump trucks, and more. The company sells its famous yellow machinery and generates additional revenue from service and maintenance contracts.\n\nCaterpillar's end markets are susceptible to the economy. Companies don't spend much money during recessions; they usually go into survival mode. Caterpillar's business will see ups and downs as a result. You can see how Caterpillar's dividend payout ratio surges higher during down years: CAT Cash Dividend Payout Ratio Chart\n\nCaterpillar has repeatedly proven it can navigate these rough waters. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years, which means it survived not only COVID-19 but also the financial crisis in 2008-2009. Today, the payout ratio is at its lowest point in a decade, which has Caterpillar prepared for the next downturn. You can buy and hold Caterpillar with confidence.\n\n2. Enbridge\n\nEnergy is the foundation of the world's economy, and Enbridge(NYSE: ENB) plays a significant role in North America. The energy company operates a network of pipelines and storage for oil and gas that spans North America from its headquarters in northern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Enbridge also has additional businesses in renewable energy generation and a gas utility segment.\n\nPipelines are Enbridge's primary business. These lines transfer oil, gas, and other materials throughout North America. While many energy companies are sensitive to commodity prices, Enbridge acts more like a toll booth; it depends on the volume flowing through its pipes. This makes Enbridge a more consistent business. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 28 consecutive years.\n\nEnbridge usually invests heavily in upgrading and maintaining its pipelines and utility businesses, so its free cash flow can be inconsistent, even if revenue streams are steady. Investors should look to the company's distributable cash flow (DCF) per share, which management uses to communicate how well the business is doing. Enbridge's DCF per share will be around $5.60 this year, and the company will pay around $3.66 per share. That's a payout ratio of 65%, making this stock's 7.4% yield a dividend you can count on.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Lockheed Martin\n\nThe United States is a world power that routinely deals with geopolitics. There's a reason why America spends more on its military than any other nation. Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) has been a major benefactor, poised to continue well into the future. Lockheed Martin designs and builds various weapons for America and its allies, ranging from fighter jets to helicopters, from missiles to satellites.\n\nToday, Lockheed Martin is most famous for its F-35 program, worth an estimated $1.7 trillion over its lifetime. It's usually bad to depend on one customer, but Lockheed Martin is an exception. It's nice when the customer you do most of your business with can literally print money to pay its bills. Politicians can occasionally scrutinize the National Defense budget, but America has spent increasingly more on its military over time.\n\nThis steady relationship has resulted in consistent dividend growth for shareholders. Lockheed Martin has paid and raised its dividend for 22 consecutive years. The dividend payout ratio is very manageable at just 49% of cash flow, and investors can lock in a 2.7% yield at the current share price. Investors can enjoy Lockheed Martin's dividends for as long as America needs its military.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Caterpillar wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "How Lockheed Martin Crushed Its Q1 Earnings Report",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) reported big earnings beats on both the top and bottom lines in its earnings report last week -- not that you would guess it from the stock price. The company beat sales predictions by 7.5% and earnings estimates by 10%, yet Lockheed stock ended the week below where it began.\n\nIs that fair?\n\nLockheed's Q1 earnings\n\nFor Q1 2024, Lockheed earned $6.39 on sales of $17.2 billion. Sales increased nearly 14% year over year, but earnings declined a bit -- down about 3% year over year. Free cash flow came in even lower than reported earnings. That's the opposite of what you'd expect to happen, so to an extent it actually was fair for investors to not bid up Lockheed stock despite the company beating expectations.\n\nWhy didn't Lockheed do even better in Q1? And why are investors upset with it despite the beat?\n\nStrange as it is to say since we're in the middle of a global bull market for weapons systems, in general, and for missiles, in particular, but Lockheed's sole underperforming business in Q1 was its missiles and fire control division. Out of Lockheed's four main divisions, each of which enjoyed growing sales in the quarter, the missiles business was the only one to show declining profits -- down 18%, despite sales climbing 25%.\n\nThe reason? Lockheed is working hard to ramp up production of pretty much every kind of missile it makes: Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM), and PAC-3 Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors, too. Presumably, it's the very same production expansion that's both enabling higher revenue growth and entailing costs that depress profits.\n\nAs for the other divisions, aeronautics sales grew 9%, space 10%, and rotary and mission systems 16%. Profits grew in each of these three units, with the biggest improvement seen in space (profits up 16%) and rotary -- profits up 25%. Aeronautics was the outlier, showing good sales growth but little improvement in profits, belying hopes that the F-35 fighter jet program would get steadily more profitable as it scales up in size.\n\nA short side trip to space\n\nI want to say a few words on Lockheed's space business -- space being the industry I focus on. Lockheed is the world's biggest pure-play defense company, so it's no surprise that its \"space\" business is primarily military in nature. The company cited higher Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) production, as well as money from its just-won $17.7 billion Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) project as contributing to revenue growth, as well as $115 million from \"national security\" satellites.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed also mentioned that it booked $30 million in profit from its 50-50 ownership (alongside Boeing) of United Launch Alliance. After launching just three rockets in all of 2023, ULA launched once in Q1 2024 and again at the start of Q2 2024. Management credited this \"higher launch volume\" for contributing a bit more profit to its bottom line.\n\nMore important to investors is that, because we know that (1) ULA launched only one single rocket in the quarter, (2) Lockheed got half the profit from that launch, and (3) this profit was $30 million, we can presume that this launch earned a total profit of $60 million for ULA.\n\nULA is a private space company, so it's difficult to gauge its profitability. But thanks to Lockheed's earnings report, we can now put a tentative value on each launch the company conducts -- $60 million -- and apply that to the rates the government pays the company for future launches to at least guess at a profit margin. And of course, we can compare that amount to the profit margin of Lockheed's publicly traded space rivals to determine whether ULA is winning or losing the space race.\n\nNow that Lockheed has let this secret slip, let's make sure to remember it.\n\nIs Lockheed Martin stock a buy?\n\nAs for the rest of Lockheed Martin, based on last week's data, we know the stock sells for about 17 times trailing earnings and 1.7 times trailing sales. According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Lockheed Martin averaged only about a 1.2x price-to-sales ratio over the first 20 years of this 21st Century -- so a 1.7x sales ratio seems on the expensive side, historically. Regarding earnings, however, Lockheed stock usually trades closer to a 22 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) than its current 17 P/E, implying that from a profits perspective, Lockheed stock is historically cheap.\n\nAs a conservative investor, I'm inclined to avoid Lockheed because of its high price-to-sales ratio (P/S). That being said, if Lockheed can keep its profit margins as high as they currently are, I might be persuaded its stock is actually a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "With the S&P 500 dipping precipitously lower over the last few days, there have been some fears ignited that we may see a stock market crash. This could then benefit this list of space stocks to buy, as it could provide cheaper entry points.\n\nI chose these three space stocks to buy based on their long-term fundamentals. I believe that these firms could bounce back faster after a sell-off compared with more speculative options on the market.\n\nThe one drawback of these firms is that they are priced fairly, but a drop in their stock prices could help mitigate or eliminate the main objections to adding them to one\u2019s portfolio. In some cases, the space industry is a growth driver for the company, as opposed to being its sole source of future earnings or revenue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, here are three spaces stocks for investors to consider adding to their portfolios in the event of a stock market crash.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), a well-established defense and aerospace firm, extends its reach significantly within the space sector. It is a major provider of satellites and other space-related technologies.\n\nNotably, Lockheed has been selected by DARPA and NASA to develop a nuclear-powered spacecraft for future missions to Mars. It also continues to enhance its satellite capabilities. The company is innovating in areas like missile defense and space exploration. They are also furthering their commitment by launching new generations of more advanced satellites.\n\nLMT also benefits from the headwinds of rising geopolitical instabilities around the world. The company is famous for the F-16 line of fighter jets, and supplies arms to many NATO and neutral nations.\n\nThe firm pays a solid dividend yield of 2.72%. This which could be bolstered in the event of a sell-off across equities. In my view, this would establish it as one of those space stocks to buy. Also, consider that it has also historically outperformed the S&P 500 over the long-term as well.\n\nIridium Communications (IRDM) the Iridium Satellite Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) operates a global network of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites providing vital communication services.\n\nIRDM is a much less speculative pick compared to other companies in the space industry. LEOs are an established source of earnings for many companies.\n\nThe company reported a net income of $38 million for Q4 2023. This was a significant turnaround from a net loss in the same period of the previous year. For the full year, Iridium\u2019s net income totaled $15.4 million, compared to $8.7 million in 2022. Additionally, Iridium\u2019s subscriber base has seen substantial growth. Total billable subscribers increaed by 14% year-over-year to 2,279,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Iridium has extended the estimated useful life of its satellites by five years. This could have positive implications for its long-term asset utilization and cost management\u200b. This then makes it one of those space stocks to buy.\n\nAstra Space (ASTR) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American aerospace company Astra Space on screen in front of web page.. ASTR stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstra Space (NASDAQ:ASTR) is primarily focused on launch services for small satellites, its innovative approach in this niche area of space exploration makes it a noteworthy contender in the space industry.\n\nASTR is a penny stock with a tiny market cap of just 14.75 million. It\u2019s therefore very risky and speculative. Furthermore, Astra\u2019s revenue for the first nine months of 2023 was notably low at $963,000, a stark contrast to the costs incurred. The revenue primarily came from their Space Products segment, as the Launch Services did not generate revenue during this period.\n\nHowever, ASTR is actively realigning its resources, focusing more on the Astra Spacecraft Engines business, which has a better promise for revenue and earnings growth in the future.\n\nI think that given the risks involved for ASTR, the lower one\u2019s entry price is for the company, the better, offering potentially lower financial risks as well as prospects for capital appreciation. If ASTR\u2019s shares depreciate in the face of a broad market sell off, as most speculative stocks do, then it could be worth opening a small position in the company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 75%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Lockheed Martin's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 8 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership Recent sales by insiders\n\nA look at the shareholders of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Lockheed Martin.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nLockheed Martin already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Lockheed Martin's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Lockheed Martin. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 9.2% of the stock.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$63m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Lockheed Martin. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin's open systems architecture is advancing the future of AI-enabled autonomous flight with human oversight\n\nEDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., May 3, 2024  /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin Skunk Works\u00ae (NYSE: LMT) joined the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and other government and industry partners in hosting U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall to fly in the X-62A Variable In-flight Simulation Test Aircraft (VISTA), a one-of-a-kind aircraft modified to test artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy capabilities. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, onboard the X-62 VISTA, takes off from Edwards Air Force Base, California, May 2. (Air Force photo by Madeline Guadarrama)\n\nVISTA is an AI pathfinder that facilitates development and testing of cutting-edge AI techniques with new uncrewed vehicle designs. This work is essential to realizing distributed teaming. In less than a year, the teams installed initial live AI agents into the X-62A's systems, demonstrated the first AI versus human dogfight and completed over 100,000 lines of flight-critical software changes across 21 test flights.\n\n\"The need for innovation at speed and scale is greater than ever. The X-62A VISTA is a crucial platform in our efforts to develop, test and integrate AI, as well as to establish AI certification standards that will revolutionize the future of aerospace,\" said John Clark, vice president and general manager, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. \"Our proven hardware and software architecture enable safe and controlled environments for AI agents and advanced algorithms to rapidly prototype and develop.\"\n\nLockheed Martin's open systems architecture, which leverages Skunk Works' Model Following Algorithm (MFA) and System for Autonomous Control of the Simulation (SACS), enables highly complex tests. These important updates enhance VISTA's capabilities while maintaining its rapid-prototyping advantage, allowing for quick changes to software and the ability to conduct flight tests with great frequency, accelerating the pace of AI and autonomy development to meet urgent national defense priorities.\n\nThis architecture has proven to be reliable and robust enough to transition into third-party distributed hardware to replicate safe and controlled flight test objectives as demonstrated by VISTA. Lockheed Martin is at the forefront of fusing AI-enabled platform autonomy with human oversight to accelerate operational speed, maximize agility and cut sustainment costs.\n\nThe achievements of and technologies developed through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program will serve as a foundation for future advances in safer, more reliable, and more efficient aviation \u2013 both for military and commercial domains.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecretary Kendall's flight closely follows several major VISTA recognitions for work done as part of DARPA's ACE program, including being nominated as finalists for the 2023 Robert J. Collier Trophy and receiving the Society of Flight Test Engineers' James S. McDonnell Award and Aviation Week's 2024 Laureate Award for Defense.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin is a\u00a0global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery. Our all-domain mission solutions and 21st Century Security\u00ae vision accelerate the delivery of transformative technologies to ensure those we serve always stay ahead of ready.

        "title": "Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 20 states where the US military spends the most money. You can skip our detailed analysis on the breakdown of the Department of Defense (DoD)\u2019s spending by state and head over directly to the Top 5 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money.\n\nFigures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) last month revealed that global military spending reached an all-time high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, increasing 6.8% in real terms compared to 2022. This is the steepest year-on-year rise in defense expenditure since 2009. The report also highlighted that world military expenditure has now been increasing for the last consecutive nine years.\n\nDefense spending in the United States grew 2.3% to total $916 billion in 2023, which amounted to 37.5% of the global military expenditure, and represented 68% of all NATO military spending. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s defense bills also witnessed a 24% increase in 2023 amid the war in Ukraine. Israel\u2019s military expenditure rose 24% as well compared to 2022, driven by its large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza. India and Saudi Arabia also continued to spend heavily on defense during the year.\n\nThe surge in spending has a created a boom in the global defense industry, especially for aerospace and armaments manufacturers in the United States \u2013 a country that accounts for nearly two-fifths of all global military spending, and is home to several top defense contractors countries across the world looks toward to procure their military supplies from.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $67.6 billion in revenues in 2023, reporting an increase of 2.4% in comparison to 2022. The aerospace company\u2019s net earnings were also $1.2 billion higher compared to last year. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers soared as well, with sales reaching a whopping $68.9 billion in 2023, having grown 3% year-on-year. On the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) posted its highest revenue in history, totaling $42.3 billion last year \u2013 which was 7.3% higher than in 2022.\n\nAs a result, the United States continues to retain its military superiority over its rivals, and given the advanced research and development ongoing in the country\u2019s defense industry, this trend is likely to stay for the foreseeable future. The country is already looking ahead to the future, and working on building weapons tailored to address the rapidly evolving dynamics of modern warfare.\n\nAn example of that is the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Program launched by the United States Air Force (USAF) in 2014 to develop the sixth-generation fighter jet to replace Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-22 Raptor. The USAF requested $1.7 billion in its FY24 budget for the project which is likely to cost $16 billion between 2023 and 2028. Five companies \u2013 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) \u2013 are working on the NGAD Program, with each being awarded contracts worth $975 million in 2022 for a period of ten years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe enormous sums of money that go into the American defense industry for the procurement of new military equipment by the US government and foreign buyers, and the research and development to develop improved weaponry, heavily influences the US economy in many ways. However, the spending is not evenly distributed across all states. Understandably so, states that are home to major defense companies and host a larger number of military installations receive a greater share of this money.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) in September 2023 released a report on its contract obligations and spending across various states of the United States in 2022. Of the $558.7 billion spent that year, 70% went into contracts for products and services, while 28% were used to pay salaries of DoD\u2019s personnel. 2% of the total amount was awarded as grants. Let\u2019s now take a look at top states where the US military spends the most money. Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money\n\nFrontpage/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe top 20 states where the US military spends the most money are ranked in ascending order of the DoD spending by state in billions of dollars. 2022 is the latest year for which data is available, and was released by the Department of Defense in September 2023. In cases where the estimated, rounded figure of defense spending was similar for two or more states, we outranked one over the other on the basis of defense spending per resident, with the state having the greater value ranking higher in the list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 biggest aircraft carriers in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the naval industry and head over directly to the 5 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World, which includes a $13.3 billion warship!\n\nConflicts in different parts of the world have created a surge in the demand for aircraft carriers. The global industry for these giant war machines is projected to grow 2% between 2023 and 2028, with Asia-Pacific being the fastest growing market for aircraft carriers. These are among the most vital strategic military assets deployed by countries, that allow planes to land on and take off from the sea, that can prove critical during any armed conflict.\n\nThe history of aircraft carriers date back to 1910 when an American pilot, Eugene Ely, flew an aircraft from the deck of a cruiser in Virginia, and then in 1911 made a landing on a battleship in San Francisco Bay. These battleships attained great prominence with the British Navy\u2019s HMS Argus, developed during World War I, and later the USS Langley becoming the first carrier to join the fleet of the US Navy in 1922. However, it was not until the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 that marked the arrival of aircraft carriers in military conflicts. Since then, several naval powers have focused on developing aircraft carriers, which are now considered as the most potent platform for naval warfare.\n\nToday\u2019s aircraft carriers are not only larger in size, but also come equipped with angled, armored fighting decks, latest electromagnetic and gear technology, steam-powered catapults, and landing signal systems to address complexities faced by older versions due to heavy weights and high landing speeds of aircraft. Moreover, there are also different variants of aircraft carriers in the market, such as nuclear-powered carriers, helicopter carriers, multipurpose carriers, and amphibious assault ships.\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is among the major players in the industry, and has provided the US Navy with several notable aircraft carriers over the years, including the next-generation Gerald R. Ford class of aircraft carriers, which would equip the American Navy to meet the operational needs of naval combat in the 21st century. These nuclear-powered carriers are being developed to replace the Nimitz class, and would be an improved version of the latter with features allowing greater aircraft deployments, fewer sailors, higher electrical power for ship systems, and a reduction in operating costs per ship by $4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) has been a significant contributor to the strength of the US Navy. Besides building critical warships, the company also provides service facilities for these aircraft carriers while they remain in operation. 2023 was a record-breaking year for Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), with the company generating $11.5 billion in revenues \u2013 its highest in history, and 7.3% higher compared to 2022.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has also played its role in enhancing the naval strength of the United States by taking an active part in sea-based tests involving aircraft carriers. According to reports, the CVN-79 Gerald R. Ford class carrier, which is scheduled to enter service in July 2025, will be capable of deploying Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-35 fighter jets by its next maintenance period.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s expertise in building warships for the US military, especially submarines, has also been widely acclaimed by defense experts for contributing towards America\u2019s naval strength. The company has been lending support for the aircraft carrier programs as well. In April 2023, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was awarded a $847 million contract to repair, maintain, and modernize carriers operated by the US Navy. 15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 15 biggest aircraft carriers in the world are ranked in ascending order of their displacement in tonnes. Data has been sourced from Insider Monkey and Yahoo Finance\u2019s article on the 12 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers. In cases where two or more carriers had the same level of displacement, we outranked one over the other based on the technological capabilities of the warships.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 16 Strongest Navies in the World in 2024.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the biggest aircraft carriers in the world by displacement.\n\n15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World:\n\n15. Atlantico\n\nCountry: Brazil\n\nDisplacement: 21,500 tonnes\n\nAtlantico is the only aircraft carrier in South America. The warship was originally built as HMS Ocean and was in use by the Royal Navy in the United Kingdom, before being acquired by Brazil recently in 2018. The country plans on using the aircraft carrier to operate military drones. Atlantico has a displacement of 21,500 tonnes.\n\n14. Juan Carlos I\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nDisplacement: 26,000 tonnes\n\nJuan Carlos I is the only aircraft carrier operated by the Spanish Navy, and is named after the country\u2019s former king.

Liaoning\n\nCountry: China\n\nDisplacement: 60,000 tonnes\n\nChinese aircraft carrier Liaoning is in the sixth spot in the list, with a displacement of 60,000 tonnes.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nLockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.19 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.27 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $16.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.8%. The $69.46 billion and $72.16 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What is an Annuity for Retirement? 15 Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss what is an annuity for retirement and 15 dividend stocks to buy instead. You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject, and go directly to read What is an Annuity for Retirement? 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead.\n\nFor many Americans approaching retirement age, one of the most significant and potentially anxiety-inducing questions they face is: what is an annuity for retirement? An annuity is an insurance product that provides regular payments and is often included in retirement plans. They are mainly issued by insurance companies, where individuals typically invest a lump sum of money in exchange for a guaranteed income stream for the duration of their life, just like a pension or Social Security benefits. Annuities play an important role in financial planning, considering many Americans are not satisfied with the state of their retirement resources. In fact, a survey conducted by BlackRock revealed that 60% of employees expressed their concern about the possibility of outliving their retirement savings.\n\nDue to high-interest rates and fluctuating market conditions, more and more people are investing in annuities for a reliable source of income during retirement and to mitigate the risk of outliving one\u2019s savings. According to an estimate by an insurance industry group, LIMRA, sales of annuities reached their all-time record high of $385 billion in 2023, showing a remarkable increase of 23% compared to the preceding year. The report further mentioned that the sales set a new record in the fourth quarter of 2023, totaling approximately $115.3 billion. This shows that fixed annuities are a bedrock of retirement planning for millions of Americans, accounting for a significant portion of the nation\u2019s retirement savings. According to a report by Bloomberg, these fixed annuities represent over $3 trillion of the country\u2019s retirement funds.\n\nWhile annuities have remained the top priority of retiree investors, one should keep track of how fast the insurance industry is evolving, with private insurance companies taking over the sector gradually. For this reason, analysts advise investing in stocks and bonds, especially in periods of high-interest rates. Aaron Brown,\u00a0 a former head of financial market research at AQR Capital Management, wrote an article for Bloomberg in 2023 advocating stocks and bonds in retirement planning. He said that diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds have historically delivered a yield of around 4% over the long term, keeping pace with inflation. These portfolios typically have low or no fees and offer high liquidity and flexibility. Over time, they tend to increase in value, even after accounting for inflation, allowing beneficiaries to pass on the legacy to their heirs. Here is what he wrote further:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cInflation-adjusted life annuities have to offer higher rates than 4% for most investors to consider paying the often-high fees, while accepting the loss of liquidity and flexibility (as well as the complexities) of many contracts, and the loss of assets that can be passed along to their heirs.\u201d\n\nWithin investing, dividend growth stocks are known for their reliability, particularly among retirees, as these companies consistently provide investors with steady streams of income. Retirees worried about what is an annuity for retirement should consider investing in dividend growth stocks. We have previously covered strong dividend payers for investors nearing their retirement age in Early Retirement Portfolio: 16 Stocks to Live Off Dividends Revisited. In another article on the subject, we reported how dividend growers have delivered strong returns over the years while providing a hedge against market downturns. The report mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 69.34% of the time during down months and around 43.6% of the time during up months.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend growers to consider for retirement as these companies hold decades-long dividend growth streaks and have strong balance sheets.

        "title": "14 Strongest Military Forces in the Middle East",
        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 14 Strongest Military Forces In The Middle East. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the use of drones in modern-day warfare in the Middle East, you can go directly to the top 5 Strongest Military Forces In The Middle East.\n\nThe Middle East, a region encompassing the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait), the Levant (modern Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and Jordan), Turkey, Egypt, Iran, and Iraq, is for the most part, a troubled region with a long-standing history of political, civil, and geopolitical unrest and conflicts.\n\nWhether it be the invasion of Lebanon by Israel in 1982 or the invasion of Iraq by NATO, comprising some of strongest militaries in the world, wars, and conflicts have destabilized many countries in the region and given birth to politically-led militia groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas in the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe existence and influence of militant groups and armed forces in Middle East countries, particularly in Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and Syria are a serious threat to the sovereignty of the countries in the region. At the same time, the Middle East is also home to some of the most powerful militaries in the world, which makes many of these conflicts more ravaging than most. (See also: 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024 and 25 Countries with the Strongest Armies in the World)\n\nOn the 1st of April 2024, an Israeli airstrike targeted an Iranian diplomatic base in Damascus, the capital of Syria. The airstrike killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, the General of the Quds Force. In retaliation, Iran attacked Israel twelve days later, on the 13th of April, launching around 170 drones, 120 surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles in a span of five hours. While the Israeli missile defense system reportedly intercepted the attack with \"99% effectiveness\" with the help of the US and other allies, Iran\u2019s low-cost high-precision suicide drones made headlines.\n\nThe 11-foot-long drone used by Iran, named Shahed-136, has a lightweight frame and carries over a hundred built-in explosives. It reaches the target using a satellite system, crashes and explodes upon contact. First introduced at an exhibition in Iran in 2014, the Shahed-136 was initially referred to as \u201ca poor man\u2019s cruise missile\u201d because of how cheap and simple it was. But both these factors mean that the Shahed-136, a low-cost munition, can be produced in high quantities and can be quite effective if used strategically.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to an Iranian analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin, the size, range, warhead weight, and engine are factors that set the Shahed-136 drone apart. In fact, owing to these factors, we are now seeing this new generation of suicide drones transform the face and economies of warfare. One unit of the Shahed-136 only costs around $50,000, and Russia has also reportedly been using this drone against Ukraine since October 2022.\n\nAside from Russia and Iran, because of how cheap of a bargain suicide drones are for the military economies, many countries, especially on the Middle East map, are already manufacturing and using them. The Syrian government forces had been using FPV (first-person-view) suicide drones to target military bases of opposition and also some civilian areas along the front lines. The White Helmets, previously known as the Syrian Civil Defense system, said that there were 13 suicide drone attacks from the first of January 2024 to 22 February.\n\nModern-day warfare and the increasing use of suicide drones in the Middle East and Europe are making loitering munition a centerpiece of global conflicts and allowing many players to enter and expand the market. Some existing key players in the drone and loitering munition market include AeroVironment Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and RTX Corp (NYSE:RTX).\n\nAeroVironment Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV), one of the leading global defense contractors based in the United States, introduced its loitering munition drone in 2011. It was called the Switchblade and was later rebranded as the Switchblade 300. On 24 March 2023, AeroVironment Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) was awarded a $64.6 million firm-fixed-price contract by the U.S. Army Tactical Aviation and Ground Munitions (TAGM) for the Switchblade 300 loitering missile systems. In total, the company has received a total funding of around $231.3 million for the Switchblade loitering systems under the original US Army contract.\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), meanwhile, is a leading American company in aerospace, arms, and defense technology. Lockheed Martin has been making unarmed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for over a decade now. However, after the trend of increased use of loitering munition in combats, the company decided to make an efficient Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) released MORFIUS, which is a reusable, multi-engagement, loitering inceptor that uses microwave energy to zap down a swarm of drones.\n\nOn the other hand, RTX Corp (NYSE:RTX), previously known as Raytheon Technologies Corporation, introduced its low-cost C-UAS Coyote Block 2 at the World Defense Show 2024 in Saudi Arabia. Coyote Block 2 is capable of taking down a range of UAS, including small and large drones as well as those at higher altitudes. Moreover, according to RTX Corp (NYSE:RTX), Coyote Block 2 can take down single as well as swarm of drones with improved accuracy. 14 Strongest Military Forces in the Middle East\n\n15 Strongest Military Forces In The Middle East\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our ranking of Middle Eastern countries by strongest military forces, we have considered several weighted metrics. These include manpower (10%), tanks (10%), aircraft fleet strength (5%), submarines (5%), military satellites in orbit (5%), overseas military bases (5%), nuclear weapons (10%), GDP (25%), defense spending (20%), cybersecurity capabilities (2.5%), and technological capabilities (2.5%).\n\nTo obtain these metrics, we used the same methodology as used in our recent articles. Namely, 15 Countries with the Most Battle Tanks in the World, 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World, 13 Countries With The Most Overseas Military Bases, 25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024, and 20 Countries With Highest Military Spending In The World. For the number of satellites in orbit, we consulted the UCS satellite database.\n\nIt must be noted that the GDP and defense spending figures are for 2023, but in some cases, we faced the issue of data unavailability, and we resorted to the most recent available data. In particular, we used 2022 GDP figures for Lebanon, 2014 figures for UAE and Yemen\u2019s defense spending, and 2022 data for Qatar\u2019s defense spending. We did not include Syria and Palestine in our calculations due to the complete unavailability of data. Lastly, the Global Innovation Index 2023 was used to determine the technological capabilities of countries, while the NCSI Rankings were used to determine the cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nWe obtained data for each metric, normalized it, ranked countries for each metric and then calculated a weighted average for each country's rankings on these metrics according to the assigned metrics weights. This was done for all countries considered in our research. Finally, we sorted and arranged our data for the list of strongest military forces in the Middle East in descending order of their overall weighted rankings.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Lockheed Martin's New $17.7 Billion Missile Contract",
        "content": "It's been a good three years since there was anything to say about the U.S. Missile Defense Agency's \"Next Generation Interceptor\" project -- a plan to build and buy probably thousands of interceptor missiles to put a missile shield over the U.S. Three years of quiet... shattered by an explosion of good news for Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) last week.\n\nOn Monday, Lockheed announced that MDA has awarded it a prime contract to build \"the most modern, reliable, and technically advanced interceptor in the history of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\" In a separate statement, MDA added that both Lockheed and an unnamed rival (which was Northrop Grumman) submitted preliminary designs on competing interceptor missiles -- itself a $1.6 billion award split between the two teams -- but Lockheed came out on top.\n\nBoeing and Raytheon had previously also competed for the contract. Boeing, having built the original GMD system, was a favorite to win the upgrade work, but Boeing dropped out of the NGI competition in 2019, taking Raytheon with it.\n\nThat left Lockheed with only one foe to vanquish, and it's accomplished that. Now what investors want to know is: What comes next for Lockheed Martin?\n\nCould $17 billion become $67 billion?\n\nIt's an important question for this leading defense stock. While neither Lockheed nor MDA mentioned a price tag for NGI in their press releases, media reports indicate that Lockheed will collect $17.7 billion over the contract's lifetime. And that could be just the start.\n\nAs my colleague Lou Whiteman pointed out in 2021, the U.S. spent a total of $67 building the original GMD system. With inflation, you've got to expect that the new NGI project will eventually bring at least that much revenue to Lockheed's door -- and probably more. Sure, Lockheed won't get to keep all the loot. It will share the revenue among its subcontractors, which include rocket specialist Aerojet Rocketdyne, now owned by L3 Harris Technologies. But as prime contractor on the project, you have to assume that Lockheed will keep the lion's share of the wealth for itself; $17.7 billion at least. And probably closer to $67 billion for missile defense.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIt's important for investors to understand that this money will not come all at once, nor immediately.\n\nLockheed may have won the contract for NGI, and will be paid as it works to fulfill the contract, but it still must pass multiple further stages before it can collect the bulk of the money -- including critical design review, flight testing of the interceptor missiles, and integrating NGI into the existing GMD system.\n\nStory continues\n\nInitial operational capability is still more than four years away, with MDA hoping to field the defensive weapons by the fourth quarter of 2028. And Lockheed will (probably, eventually) pass all the technical hurdles needed to reach that point. The company has a long history of successful work in missile defense, including building the interceptor missiles both for PATRIOT and for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense systems. But even so, delays can crop up over the course of a multiyear timeline, and investors should anticipate this going in.\n\nWhat it means for Lockheed Martin\n\nCaveats notwithstanding, this is clearly a big win for Lockheed, and maybe even bigger than many investors realize.\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, the division that will build NGI, is the company's smallest revenue contributor at \"only\" $11.9 billion last year. Dollar for revenue dollar, however, Missiles is also Lockheed's single most profitable division, generating an operating profit margin just shy of 13% last year. (For comparison, Lockheed's other three divisions -- aeronautics, rotary, and space -- all earn closer to 10% margins.) In other words, each dollar of revenue run through the missiles division is worth about 30% more to Lockheed's bottom line than a similar dollar run through any of the company's other three major divisions.\n\nAnd now Lockheed Martin looks likely to run $17.7 billion (or $67 billion, or more) through this profits powerhouse of a missiles division.\n\nSo yes, it may take a few more years before Lockheed benefits fully from this contract. With a big pot-of-gold windfall at the end of the effort, however, I suspect investors will be happy to wait for as long as it takes to bring NGI to fruition.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Finding opportunities for a steady and high return is crucial before the next market boom. Three exceptional businesses provide attractive opportunities in various industries.\n\nLeading the aerospace and military industries, the first one gains from significant revenue growth fueled by important government contracts. The corporation has secured its place as a top performer in the industry by receiving more money for essential initiatives with the passage of the FY2024 defense budget. Similarly, the second one takes advantage of the expanding market for smokeless oral goods, which is expanding significantly in both the Japanese and American markets. The company\u2019s dominance in this market indicates consumers gravitate toward healthier options.\n\nIn the meantime, the third one demonstrates resilience and growth in hybrid solutions while showcasing its strength in IT infrastructure. The firm is positioned as a dependable investment option due to its capacity to adjust to changing market needs. Furthermore, the third company\u2019s robust free cash flow allows it to make calculated investments, improving its long-term growth prospects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach firm\u2019s strategic efforts and market positioning highlight this potential, making them appealing investment options for astute investors.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE:LMT) net sales increased significantly to $17.2 billion from $15.1 billion in the same period the previous year. This significant rise shows the company\u2019s capacity to produce large amounts of income over an extended period. With a healthy backlog of $159 billion, the firm demonstrated a solid fit between the goals and priorities of its customers and its cutting-edge technological solutions. A sizable backlog suggests a robust pipeline of potential future revenue-generating projects.\n\nMoreover, adopting the\u00a0FY2024 defense budget favors Lockheed Martin since it provides funds for several important initiatives the firm depends on, including multi-year munitions acquisition, hypersonics and secret operations. The financial additions for projects like the C-130 and F-35 aircraft further strengthened Lockheed Martin\u2019s growth prospects, including supporting important initiatives such as F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M, and others.\n\nLastly, Lockheed Martin\u2019s global market reach is demonstrated by agreements to provide\u00a0F-35 aircraft to the Czech Republic, Turkey, and Singapore, among other countries. Hence, these agreements show that Lockheed Martin\u2019s goods and services are in high demand abroad, broadening its sources of income outside of its home country.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nZYN nicotine pouches, an oral smoke-free product from Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), have grown remarkably. One vital trend is the significant development in ZYN nicotine pouch shipping volume. The number of can shipments increased by 79.7% year-over-year (YoY) to reach 131.6 million in the U.S. This significant increase demonstrates the high customer demand for ZYN products and their rising status in the oral smoke-free product market.\n\nAdditionally, ZYN has consecutive gains in market share within the oral nicotine pouch category in the United States. The company\u2019s share in the category rose to\u00a0over 74% for the fourth consecutive quarter, a sequential rise of 1.3 percentage points. The increase in market share and the dominance of Philip Morris in the area of oral smoke-free products are demonstrated by the statistics.\n\nFinally, Japan is a crucial market for Philip Morris\u2019 IQOS products, as the company has seen a significant rise in market share in that nation. Hence, IQOS increased its market share significantly in Japan, rising by more than three percentage points to\u00a0above 29%.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt constant currency, the IBM (NYSE:IBM) infrastructure segment\u2019s revenue increased by 0.2%, with hybrid infrastructure driving the majority of the rise at 6%. Revenue from IBM Z, the company\u2019s flagship hardware product, increased by 5%, demonstrating the ongoing demand for IBM\u2019s mainframe solutions.\n\nAdditionally, distributed infrastructure fared well, growing at a pace of 7% at constant currency. IBM\u2019s infrastructure division exhibits growth and durability, especially in hybrid solutions. Thus, IBM Z\u2019s robust performance highlights its continued significance in the AI age, particularly for real-time AI-inferencing workloads.\n\nMoreover, in Q1 2024, IBM generated $1.9 billion in free cash flow, a notable $600 million increase annually. During the previous 12 months, IBM generated $11.8 billion in free cash flow, putting the business in a strong position for further investment and strategic objectives. Hence,\u00a0its constant generation of large free cash flows demonstrates IBM\u2019s potential for reinvestment and financial stability.\n\nIn summary, IBM\u2019s financial stability is preserved by\u00a0pursuing\u00a0strategic acquisitions, including the upcoming\u00a0acquisition of HashiCorp, thanks to its robust cash flow.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in PM.

        "content": "The U.S. Air Force has chosen two companies that it will continue to fund as part of its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, and the decision leaves out some major defense contractors.\n\nThe Air Force this week said Anduril and General Atomics will continue on with the program to supply detailed designs, manufacture, and testing of production test aircraft.\n\nAnduril CEO Brian Schimpf praised the Air Force for embracing a fast-moving, forward-looking approach to fielding autonomous systems at speed and scale. He said the decision marks the expansion of the defense industrial base and said Anduril is proud to \u201cpave the way for other non-traditional defense companies to compete and deliver on large scale programs.\u201d\n\nMost Read on IEN:\n\nFormula E Race Car Goes from 0-60 MPH in 1.82 Seconds Apple Questioned Over Knowledge of 'Blood Minerals' The Mars Sample Return Mission Has a Shaky Future  Third NASA Engineer Joins Cannabis Automation Firm Sorting Robotics\n\nWith Anduril and General Atomics moving onto the next phase of the program, that means Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Boeing will be on the sidelines. But the Air Force said those companies along with other contractors in its industry partner vendor pool will still be competing for future production contracts.\n\nBoeing said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the decision.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed that we won\u2019t be moving forward in this phase of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Collaborative Combat Aircraft program, we are undeterred in our commitment to providing next-generation autonomous combat aircraft for U.S. and global military customers. Work continues on our robust and growing autonomous family, including the MQ-25 Stingray and future derivatives, the MQ-28 Ghost Bat, and a number of proprietary programs we can\u2019t disclose,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe CCA program is focusing on pairing unmanned, autonomous drones with later-generation fighter jets flown by human pilots. The drones will work in tandem with the manned aircraft and they\u2019ll be able to carry customizable configurations of weapons, sensors and other features to best assist on any given mission.\n\nAccording to Air & Space Forces, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said the service wants at least 1,000 and as many as 2,000 CCAs in the next 10 years. He estimated the drones would cost about $30 million each.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "L3Harris Technologies, Inc. LHX reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of $3.06 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89 by 5.9%. The bottom line also increased 7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure of $2.86.\r\n\r\nExcluding one-time items, the company reported GAAP earnings of $1.48 per share, down from $1.76 generated in the prior-year period.\n\nL3Harris Technologies Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nL3Harris Technologies Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | L3Harris Technologies Inc Quote\n\nTotal Revenues\n\nL3Harris\u2019 first-quarter revenues totaled $5.21 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.11 billion by 2%. The top line figure also rose 16.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $4.47 billion.\r\n\r\nThe year-over-year top-line improvement can be attributed to the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and organic growth from Space and classified programs within the Space & Airborne Systems segment. Growth from tactical, broadband communication and vision products within the Communication Systems segment also contributed to overall revenue growth.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nIntegrated Mission Systems: The segment recorded net revenues of $1.67 billion, down 1.8% year over year. This was due to lower Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft procurement activity.\r\n\r\nThis segment recorded an operating income of $190 million compared to the operating income of $185 million in the first quarter of 2023. The segment\u2019s operating margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 11.4%, driven by improved program performance.\r\n\r\nSpace and Airborne Systems: Net revenues from the segment were $1.75 billion, up 5.8% year over year. This upside was largely driven by growth from Space Systems and classified program growth in Intel and Cyber.\r\n\r\nThe operating income improved to $216 million from $187 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin expanded 100 bps to 12.3%, driven by improved operational and program performance, particularly in the Space Systems unit.\r\n\r\nCommunication Systems: Net revenues from this segment increased 11.3% to $1.29 billion. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes in Tactical Communications, Integrated Vision Systems and Broadband Communications.\r\n\r\nThe operating income improved to $310 million from $266 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin improved 110 bps to 24%, driven by higher volume and improved operational performance in Integrated Vision Systems.\r\n\r\nAerojet Rocketdyne: This segment reported revenues of $542 million and an operating income of $72 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial Position\n\nAs of Mar 29, 2024, L3Harris had $477 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $560 million as of Dec 29, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe long-term debt as of Mar 29, 2024 was $11.14 billion compared with $11.16 million as of Dec 29, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe net cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $104 million during the first quarter of 2024 against net cash flow from operating activities worth $350 million generated in the prior year.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2024, L3Harris\u2019s free cash outflow came in at $156 million against free cash flow worth $315 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nL3Harris updated its 2024 guidance. It now expects to generate revenues in the range of $20.80-$21.30 billion, narrower than its earlier guidance range of $20.70-$21.30 billion.\u00a0 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $21.22 billion, higher than the midpoint of the company\u2019s guided range.\r\n\r\nLHX increased its 2024 adjusted earnings to the range of $12.70-$13.05 per share from the prior guidance range of $12.40-$12.80.

        "title": "Shareholders Will Probably Hold Off On Increasing Lockheed Martin Corporation's (NYSE:LMT) CEO Compensation For The Time Being",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nLockheed Martin's Annual General Meeting to take place on 2nd of May Salary of US$1.75m is part of CEO Jim Taiclet's total remuneration The overall pay is 51% above the industry average Lockheed Martin's EPS grew by 4.0% over the past three years  while total shareholder return over the past three years was 33%\n\nCEO Jim Taiclet has done a decent job of delivering relatively good performance at Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) recently. This is something shareholders will keep in mind as they cast their votes on company resolutions such as executive remuneration in the upcoming AGM on 2nd of May. However, some shareholders may still be hesitant of being overly generous with CEO compensation.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nHow Does Total Compensation For Jim Taiclet Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?\n\nOur data indicates that Lockheed Martin Corporation has a market capitalization of US$112b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$23m for the year to December 2023. We note that's a decrease of 8.0% compared to last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.8m.\n\nFor comparison, other companies in the American Aerospace & Defense industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$15m. Hence, we can conclude that Jim Taiclet is remunerated higher than the industry median. Furthermore, Jim Taiclet directly owns US$23m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.\n\nComponent 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$1.8m US$1.8m 8% Other US$21m US$23m 92% Total Compensation US$23m US$25m 100%\n\nSpeaking on an industry level, nearly 23% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 77% is other remuneration. Lockheed Martin sets aside a smaller share of compensation for salary, in comparison to the overall industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance. ceo-compensation\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation's Growth\n\nOver the past three years, Lockheed Martin Corporation has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 4.0% per year. Its revenue is up 5.2% over the last year.\n\nWe'd prefer higher revenue growth, but it is good to see modest EPS growth. It's clear the performance has been quite decent, but it it falls short of outstanding,based on this information. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nHas Lockheed Martin Corporation Been A Good Investment?\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 33% over three years. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median.\n\nTo Conclude...\n\nGiven that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.\n\nWhile it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. That's why we did some digging and identified 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that you should be aware of before investing.\n\nArguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels.

        "title": "The Top 3 Space Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "In February 2024, investors were reminded why the space economy matters, and why it\u2019s a good time to consider the top space stocks. The United States returned to the moon with the privately built Nova C Odysseus lander. And the lander was launched from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nAlthough the mission\u00a0wasn\u2019t perfect, it does provide a glimpse of what\u2019s possible in space exploration. The next race to send humans to the moon is on. And the idea of sending a manned mission to Mars no longer seems like science fiction, although it\u2019s still years and maybe decades away.\n\nAnd if exploration is too aspirational for you, consider that the space industry also has national security and commercial applications. This is a billion-dollar industry today that will only expand in the coming years. The purest plays carry significant risk, but if you\u2019re looking for the top space stocks, consider these three.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking for top space stocks, risk won\u2019t be hard to find. Security and stability are a different matter. While not one of the Dow 30, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is about as blue blood of a stock as you can get. The company has a $110 billion market cap, it trades for a reasonable 17.5x forward earnings and pays a dividend with a 2.75% yield that has been growing for 21 straight years.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll be paying to own the stock. Each share runs about $463 as of this writing. But LMT stock will be one of the names in any space or defense ETF you\u2019ll buy. So it makes sense to consider the stock as an individual holding.\n\nAlthough Lockheed Martin may be better known as a defense contractor, space is one of the company\u2019s four core businesses. Its spacecraft\u00a0have already logged over one million hours of operation.\n\nIntuitive Machines (LUNR) Intuitive Machines (LUNR) black and white logo displayed on smartphone screen with desktop screen behind it showing company website and image of moon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nIntuitive Machines (NASDAQ:LUNR) was an integral part of the February moon landing. It was the company\u2019s Nova C Odysseus lunar module that landed on the moon\u2019s surface. But, as followers of the event learned, the module tipped over upon landing.\n\nThe journey of Odysseus was reflected in the LUNR stock price which had already doubled in 2024 prior to the launch. After initially jumping to over $11 a share, the stock has been cut by around 50% and is trading at $5.41 as of this writing.\n\nAs you consider whether LUNR stock is one of the top space stocks, the story isn\u2019t that the lunar module tipped over. It\u2019s that the company\u2019s proprietary liquid methane and liquid oxygen propulsion system achieved the first-ever deep space ignition. Plus, Intuitive Machines is already working with NASA as part of future missions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd the company\u2019s Lunar Access Services are only one part of the company\u2019s revenue stream, which hit a record high of $30.56 million in the fourth quarter 2023.\n\nRedwire (RDW) a private plane inside a hangar is prepared for a flight. represent aerospace stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInterestingly, Redwire (NASDAQ:RDW) made the list of top space stocks to watch toward the end of March. The stock has dropped 14.5% since then. But that\u2019s due to the broader market sell-off. As a micro-cap company with a market cap of just over $200 million, it was going to get dragged down in the 2024 flight to safety.\n\nBut the company provides essential building blocks of space technology infrastructure. And it has revenue streams that encompass national security, commercial and civil applications. Though not yet profitable, it has an impressive current and backlog of revenue. In fact, 80% of the company\u2019s revenue is generated through fixed, multi-year contracts.\n\nPlus, analysts continue to love the stock. As I mentioned in my prior article, it\u2019s unusual to see five analysts issue a rating on small-cap stock that isn\u2019t even profitable. And when all five give RDW stock a strong buy rating, investors should take notice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The bottom line increased 15% from $5.50 recorded in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe year-over-year improvement can be attributed to an increase in operating income, as well as an increase in the non-operating FAS pension benefit.\n\nTotal Sales\n\nNOC\u2019s total sales of $10.13 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.78 billion by 3.6%. The top line also increased 8.9% from $9.30 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. This improvement can be attributed to strong sales growth from each of its four segments.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Northrop Grumman Corporation Quote\n\nBacklog Count\n\nThe company\u2019s total backlog was $78.90 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024, compared with $84.23 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSegmental Details\n\nAeronautics Systems: This segment\u2019s sales of $2.97 billion rose 18% year over year due to higher volumes from restricted programs, as well as Triton, E-2, Global Hawk and F-35 programs.\n\nThe unit\u2019s operating income totaled $297 million compared with $237 million in the first quarter of 2023. Its operating margin improved 60 basis points (bps) to 12.5%.\n\nMission Systems: Sales in this segment increased 4% to $2.67 billion.

        "content": "With the recent passage of a $95 billion military aid bill to help Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and expectations of increased global defense spending driven by geopolitical tensions, it is a suitable time to look into some defense stocks.\n\nThe White House and Congress are currently working on the fiscal year 2025 defense budget, which some estimates suggest could reach $900 billion. In ongoing discussions, the Pentagon appears focused on developing missiles like the PrSM to replace ATACM and LRASM for naval targeting, both produced by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). However, budget constraints may lead to reduced F-35 orders despite foreign acquisitions, affecting the defense stock.\n\nIn recent years, substantial defense spending increases overseas in Europe have led to surges in European defense stocks. But more recently, performance has lagged despite market gains, as analysts question whether defense stocks have become overvalued. This follows challenges at larger U.S. firms, such as Boeing (NYSE:BA), facing aircraft construction quality issues unrelated to its defense divisions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven fluid spending and tensions, defense stocks that are not necessarily top of mind for investors may have advantages if their outlays address diverse emerging challenges.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) could be an example of one of the defense stocks that may benefit from increased spending. However, it may not be the first obvious choice for investors seeking direct exposure to the sector. As a provider of engineering, analytics consulting, and digital solutions for mission operations, BAH\u2019s services include cybersecurity, a crucial area for government clients as civilian and military networks are further hardened.\n\nWith the White House advocating for a 10% boost in cybersecurity outlays for the upcoming fiscal year, opportunities may arise for defense stocks operating in this domain. In April, Booz Allen partnered with Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) to provide immediate cybersecurity threat response to organizations facing DDoS and ransomware attacks, building a stronger case for the stock. Analyst coverage on BAH also remains consistently positive, with recommendations centered around maintaining or building a position targeting a 12-month price of $156.61 per share.\n\nHuntington Ingalls (HII) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe leading U.S. military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) represents a prominent investment opportunity in defense stocks. As the foremost builder of America\u2019s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, it is a mainstay for those seeking direct exposure to the defense sector. Aircraft carriers are critical for power projection into strategically important regions like the Red Sea and supporting allies like Taiwan. This means they remain a priority amid debates around other defense programs. HII also manufactures the new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines slated to replace the Ohio-class vessels over the next ten years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock trades at a relatively modest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.1x, below the broader S&P 500 index\u2019s current P/E ratio of 27.2x. This represents a more affordable valuation for those interested in adding defense stocks to their portfolio. Beating estimates would solidify the defense stock position as a shipbuilding leader and mark its 5th consecutive EPS beat. In addition, the company offers a dividend yield of 1.89%, paid out in March, and has a 12-year increase record.\n\nHowmet Aerospace (HWM) 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGiven the low-profile nature of its operations, aviation supply company Howmet Aerospace (NYSE:HWM) may not be at the top of many investors\u2019 minds looking for defense stocks. The company manufactures high-precision components for applications such as jet engines and forged aircraft wheels. It also offers metal management consulting services and expertise to defense sector clients. Increased orders for commercial aircraft and greater military aircraft utilization requiring more frequent parts replacements could benefit the business.\n\nAnalyst coverage remains optimistic for the company\u2019s potential to leverage its core offering to improve pricing during the current upcycle following the spin-off from Arconic (NYSE:ARNC). The company has achieved EPS growth of 24% per year over the last five years, offering stability through the alignment of the average annual increase in the share price. Shareholders have received a total return of 70% over last year alone, with a consensus price target of $73 per share, representing a double-digit upside from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Ukraine, Israel bill to bolster Lockheed, RTX profits",
        "content": "By Mike Stone\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp and RTX Corp, fresh off a surge of orders in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine and the war in Gaza, stand to profit from $95 billion of mostly new weapons funding as the increasingly drawn out conflicts renew demand for pricey equipment.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law that provides billions of dollars of new U.S. aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, including $61 billion for Ukraine and $26 billion for Israel.\n\n\"There are now factories breaking ground around the country,\" because of the new funding and several recent \"supplemental\" funding rounds, said the Pentagon's acquisitions chief Bill LaPlante on Wednesday.\n\nCombat in Ukraine and Israel have consumed high volumes of munitions, including Patriot air defense interceptors, used to shoot down Russian missiles, and vast quantities of 155 millimeter artillery rounds.\n\nThe new funds will pay for new shipments and be used to replenish U.S. stock piles. European allies have also been lining up to buy U.S. weaponry due to the war in Ukraine and a desire to strengthen NATO.\n\nThe United States needs to buy and restock \"Tomahawk, AMRAAM, Coyote, SM-6,\" RTX's CFO Neil Mitchill told Reuters in an interview, listing a long-range cruise missile, an air-to-air missile, a small drone and a ground based missile that can be used for air defense. In most cases, the U.S. has either sent the munitions to Ukraine or used them to defend Red Sea shipping lanes.\n\nLockheed's CEO Jim Taiclet told investors on Tuesday that he expects that the fiscal 2025 \"presidential budget requests and additive supplemental funding will provide a strong underpinning for future growth over the next several years for our company.\"\n\nHowever, given uncertainty about when the funding will flow to defense firms, neither Lockheed nor RTX, formerly named Raytheon Technologies, raised their sales forecasts for 2024.\n\n\"I don't expect the flash to sales to be quicker,\" RTX's Mitchill said, adding he thought contracting might \"a little bit faster\" this time. Defense contracting is a slow and legally complex process.\n\n\"The bottom line is that, you know, we've got a lot of orders. There's $77 billion of defense in our backlog. So it'll take some time to, to meet those deliveries,\" Mitchill said.\n\nRTX makes the Patriot, which stands for Phased Array Tracking Radar for Intercept on Target, surface-to-air missile defense system.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed makes the newest version of the interceptors that arm the Patriot, known as PAC-3 MSE, which cost about $4 million each, according to Army budget documents.\n\nIn January European nations banded together to buy up to 1,000 Patriot interceptors. European production for that order, a Patriot interceptor variant called Guidance Enhanced Missiles, or GEM-T, would likely be completed by COMLOG, a joint venture between RTX and MBDA, where current production capacity is limited.\n\nBut Patriot is only one of the systems where investment is needed to expand production capacity before greater revenues will flow.\n\nIn the $95 billion supplemental there is more than $17 billion earmarked for investment to expand production capacity for the U.S. defense industrial base including 155 millimeter shell production and $3.3 billion for shipyards.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Stone; editing by Chris Sanders and Sonali Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Washington is spending another $61 billion to help Ukraine. But most of the money will flow through the US economy first.\n\nThe new law will allow the Pentagon to send existing weapons \u2014 everything from bullets to missiles to tank parts \u2014 to Kyiv and then simultaneously backfill that inventory with new manufacturing efforts for US armories.\n\nThere are 117 production lines in about 71 US cities that are set to produce those weapons systems, according to research from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI).\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed the bill Wednesday morning as part of a larger package that will provide additional aid to Israel and the Indo-Pacific as well as possibly ban TikTok in the US next year.\n\n\"We're sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles, then we'll replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America,\" the president explained just after signing the bill.\n\n\"We are helping Ukraine while at the same time investing in our own industrial base,\" he added, saying the money will be felt across 40 states.\n\nAEI fellow Marc Thiessen and his colleagues cite a somewhat lower tally \u2014 31 states \u2014 but agree with Biden that the effect will be substantial.\n\n\"Our military aid to Ukraine is revitalizing manufacturing communities across the United States,\" Thiessen wrote in a recent Washington Post essay.\n\nAEI identified a host of areas \u2014 from Ohio to New Hampshire to Missouri to California \u2014 that are set to benefit most directly. Many of these states are notably represented by lawmakers who voted no on the bill this week.\n\nIn deep-red Missouri, as one example in the AEI data, Boeing (BA) and RTX (formerly Raytheon) Corporation (RTX) build things like glide-bombs and tracking radar.\n\nLikewise in Alabama, where companies like BAE Systems (BAESY), General Dynamics (GD), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) operate to produce things like fighting vehicles, howitzer parts, and Javelin surface-to-air missiles. Activists wave Ukrainian flags outside the US Capitol on April 23. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) (MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images)\n\nRTX also operates in Alabama and recently broke ground on an expansion of its missile facility there.\n\nLockheed Martin and General Dynamics also reported quarterly earnings this week and used their releases to tout their relationship with the Pentagon and how defense contracts help their bottom lines.\n\nThe US has now sent well over $100 billion to Ukraine in a series of aid efforts that have followed a similar pattern, with a spur first to US manufacturing. Observers have also noted that the money allows the Pentagon to upgrade and modernize the US arsenal in a way that otherwise might not have been possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nMark Cancian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies recently wrote about how a cut-off in aid would have other effects, from underfunding existing US forces to undermining humanitarian relief efforts.\n\nThe aid measure passed this week also includes over $26 billion for Israel. Some of that money is denoted as military and weapons assistance and likely to follow a similar pattern of benefiting US weapons makers (and their employees) first.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

As a result, we delivered robust revenue growth across the company, and we maintained a robust backlog of $159 billion, reflecting alignment between our advanced technology solutions and our customers' key missions and priorities. These first quarter results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve the full year financial expectations we shared in the most recent earnings call. Moreover, the approved FY2024 defense budget reflected many positives for Lockheed Martin, consistent with national defense strategy priorities too.\n\nHighlights include robust funding for munitions multi-year procurement, continued investment in hypersonics and classified activities, and ongoing support for programs such as Black Hawk, CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, the fleet ballistic missile, C-130, and F-35. There were also additions to the original budget submission, including F-35 aircraft, C-130, and combat rescue helicopters. The initial budget request for FY2025, while still very early in the process, continues support of many of these same major programs, including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M and others. In addition to emphasis on advanced munitions programs such as JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, Daimler, and PAC-3, as well as hypersonic conventional prompt strike and the long range hypersonic weapon.\n\nIn addition to that, next-generation interceptor is getting support, which I'll address more in a moment. In this week, funding of $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific security supplementals passed the House and is currently under consideration in the Senate. We expect FY2025 Presidential Budget request and additive supplemental funding will provide a strong underpinning for future growth over the next several years for our company, giving us further confidence in our long range plan. While demand for these key programs remains elevated, it is also essential that our program performance in terms of quality, safety, cost and schedule gets and stays at the highest level. On our most significant programs, I, Jay, and my senior executive team are personally and directly involved.\n\nOn F-35, we remain focused on program execution in terms of concurrent development, production and sustainment, and we are bringing all relevant resources across our company and collaborating closely with our customers and suppliers to fully implement the TR-3 capabilities that everybody is looking forward to getting. These capabilities based on the new core processor, data storage unit, and pilot display will ensure that the F-35 is not only the most capable and effective fighter aircraft in the world, but it will also further advance its abilities to act as the air domain quarterback of joint all domain operations for the U.S. and its allies. We're encouraged by the solid progress made over the last few months towards resuming deliveries, including improvement in aircraft mission system capabilities and system stability as we advance from prior software versions towards a combat training capable configuration.\n\nFlight testing of this configuration is now underway and we're on a path we expect to be on with regard to maturing the system with approximately 95% of TR-3 capabilities in this flight test program. The test results to-date support our expected timeline of delivering the first TR-3 combat training capable aircraft in the third quarter and then transition to a fully combat capable aircraft in 2025. As planned, there will be continual software updates to support further capability insertions over the Block 4 program and beyond. While there were no final deliveries of F-35 jets in the first quarter, we're maintaining our production rate and continue to expect an aircraft delivery range for 2024 between 75 and 110, which requires timely receipt of the necessary hardware from TR-3 suppliers along the way.\n\nThe F-35's advanced combat and interoperability capabilities continue to create strong demand for the aircraft internationally too. In the quarter, the Czech Republic became the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team with a signed letter of offer and acceptance, making it official its intent to procure 24 F-35s. In addition, the U.S. State Department approved a potential foreign military sale to Greece for up to 40 F-35s. And Singapore announced its intent to purchase eight F-35As to complement the 12 F-35Bs to which it has already previously committed. Also in the lower air domain, while we're disappointed in the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program or FARA, Sikorsky remains committed to delivering innovative and reliable aviation capabilities to our domestic and global customers.\n\nWith a strong foundation of more than $20 billion in backlog, bolstered by expected and funded growth in the heavy lift CH-53K helicopter program, Sikorsky\u2019s multi-year outlook is stable. We're also encouraged by the army's renewed commitment to Black Hawk production and modernization, as well as our ability to address mission gaps with capability upgrades that leverage Lockheed Martin's broad portfolio of solutions in the lower air domain, things such as autonomy, AI, et cetera. Turning now to missile defense missions, which given recent world events are becoming more critical than ever. We continue to lead the industry. Last week, the missile defense agency or MDA selected Lockheed Martin to deliver the new homeland missile defense capability for the United States, which is called the next-generation interceptor or NGI.\n\nAs the MDA's NGI prime contractor, Lockheed Martin will provide the most modern, reliable and technically advanced interceptor in the history of this system. This program was a 1LMX that's our digital transformation worn digital program meaning we embrace model-based engineering, digital tools, processes and technologies from the very, very start of this program. Now, as it continues on its path to the critical design review, integration with broader weapons system and flight tests, I'm proud of the Lockheed Martin team that enabled all of this. We were MDA's early down select before it was even on their schedule because we're so far in front to get this essential homeland defense capability off to a fast start. Earlier this quarter, the Long Range Discrimination Radar or LRDR, completed final acceptance and was officially handed over to the Missile Defense Agency in preparation for an operational capability baseline decision.\n\nAnd what that means is final transition to active service for that radar to help defend the country. The LRDR is a cutting edge national asset providing the benefits of both low and high frequency radars to search, track, and discriminate incoming missiles with an open system approach, enabling the customer to add incremental capabilities such as hypersonic defense. This is located up in Alaska, in the prime location, where we can sense early what any attack might look like and respond to it. What that really does, though, is create an elevated deterrence to any kind of attack like that. So it's really great to have LRDR about ready to go online. Now, both NGI and LRDR will be critical elements within the overall homeland defense mission, and they're going to be integrated into the broader defense architecture with a battle management system that we call command control, battle management and communications, or as the military calls it, C2BMC.\n\nSo that's the system that's going to be used to integrate the radars, the missiles, and allow us to defend the country. In April, Lockheed Martin was selected for a potential 10-year, $4 billion follow-on C2BMC next-generation contract with the MDA, demonstrating again our leadership position and battle management systems for homeland defense. Under this contract, we'll continue to modernize and expand the system's capabilities to enhance global integration, improve space domain awareness, and optimize sensor connectivity and data fusion to levels never done before. All of which will create the most complete picture of these incoming threats as I just spoke about a minute ago. Separately, we also continue to advance our 21st Century security solution through collaboration with strategic commercial partners across the tech, telecom, microprocessor, and other industries to support the national defense. A military aircraft in flight, showing the strength of the company's combat & air mobility capability.\n\nCiting just one example, we announced Lockheed Martin will work with Intel to support the simulated transition for Advanced Microelectronics Packaging or STAMP program for the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. This CHIPS Act related collaboration will provide a revolutionary leap in defense systems capabilities using high performance U.S. built semiconductors. Over the next 18 months, we'll integrate our latest sensor open system architecture technology with Intel semiconductors with the intent to ultimately implement, test and complete production through the U.S. Navy's Lockheed Martin MH-60 Romeo helicopter program. I'll now turn it over to Jay for more highlights and some additional commentary on our financial results.\n\nJay?\n\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim. I'll cover the consolidated results and touch on some additional highlights before handing it off to Maria, who will discuss the quarterly financials by business area, and then I'll come back to discuss the outlook and close out the remarks. Starting with chart four, we had a strong start to the year. First quarter sales of $17.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. While the results benefited from an extra calendar week compared to 2023, normalized year-over-year sales growth was a solid 5%. We saw strong labor and material throughput indicative of an improving supply chain. We'll continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to enhance quality and performance proactively and, as needed, expand the breadth and depth of our engagement at supplier locations.\n\nSegment operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 4% year-over-year with margins of 10.1%, and included the anticipated $100 million reach-forward loss associated with the classified missile program at MFC. Excluding this charge, Lockheed Martin segment margins were 10.7%, primarily reflecting year-over-year lower profit adjustments. GAAP earnings per share of $6.39 were down 3% as year-over-year benefits from higher profit and lower share count were more than offset by higher interest expense, lower pension income, and mark-to-market gains. Book-to-bill in the first quarter was just below one. Notably, space booked several large national security orders in the quarter, including SDA tracking layer and other significant classified awards, contributing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.8 and record backlog of $33 billion at space.\n\nWe generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter after investing $360 million in research and development and $380 million in capital expenditures. Share repurchases were $1 billion and we returned $780 million through our dividend. Shifting over to additional highlights in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress we are making on the F-16 program. The first three F-16 Block 70 jets varied from Greenville, South Carolina to Bahrain in March. To-date, Lockheed Martin has produced five F-16 Block 70 jets for Bahrain with additional 11 in various stages of production and testing. We also presented the first two F-16 Block 70 aircraft to Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, underscoring the deepening partnership between the two countries.\n\nIn addition, the State Department notified Congress of authorization of the sale of 40 F-16s and related upgrades and support to Turkey. The latest deal builds on our long relationship and history with the Turkish Air Force. We are confident the F-16 Block 70 and Viper upgrade package provide advanced 21st Century security capabilities with affordable operating and lifecycle costs for Turkey. We also continue to upgrade our weapon systems for longer range standoff capability. In February in the U.S., the extended range ER variant of GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system achieved success in its first operational test. The U.S. army fired two unitary warhead ER GMLRS variants with a HIMARS launcher, demonstrating precision and advancing this capability closer to production.\n\nThe U.S. army almost awarded Lockheed Martin the fourth production contract for early operating capability precision strike missiles known as PrSM. This award will allow for a significant increase in production quantities to meet army demand for long range surface missiles. And the hypersonics, following the recent end-to-end flight test, we completed the test program of the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon or ARRW with full confidence in its revolutionary capabilities. We have demonstrated successful all up round end-to-end performance on multiple occasions. ARRW provides the U.S. with the earliest air launch fully qualified production ready supersonic solution -- hypersonic solution, I'm sorry. And Lockheed Martin is prepared to quickly deliver additional tactical, operational and leave behind hypersonic strike assets that can be rapidly deployed to the U.S. military.\n\nWe also continue to advance hypersonic strike capability in the land and sea domains through the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon and Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Both solutions have a full year milestones ahead as we progress towards operational capability. Shifting the integrated air and missile defense arena the AEGIS Weapon System successfully executed one of the most complicated ballistic missile defense tests in the first quarter. When the system tracked and intercepted a medium range ballistic missile amidst multiple decoys. The test employed the latest updates to the system and demonstrates the reliability of AEGIS to operate in a dynamic threat environment and we're constantly evolving the AEGIS system. This quarter, we made further progress on our efforts to integrate with PAC-3 to enable an affordable, combat proven IAMD capability for maritime engagements and expand the mission capability of our systems.\n\nI'll pause here and let me turn it over to Maria to cover the business areas.\n\nMaria Ricciardone: Okay. Thanks, Jay. Today, I will discuss first quarter year-over-year results for the business areas. Starting with aeronautics on chart five. First quarter sales at Aero were over $6.8 billion up 9% year-over-year, and that's 1% normalized for the extra week in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and Skunk Works and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit is comparable year-over-year with higher volume being offset by lower margin development contract mix and lower net profit adjustments, mainly on the F-35. Aeronautics backlog remains at a healthy $57 billion, which includes 373 F-35s and 80 C-130Js, and 132 F-16s, supporting growth into 2025 and beyond.\n\nTurning to Missiles and Fire Control on Chart 6, sales increased 25% from the prior year, 16% normalized for the extra week driven by production ramps on tactical and strike missile programs, primarily GMLRS, HIMARS and JASSM, LRASM. Integrated air and missile defense also saw higher volume on PAC-3 and THAAD. As expected, segment operating profit decreased 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the $100 million loss on the classified program Jay mentioned previously. Normalizing for the loss, MFC's margins would have been 13.7%. Now, I'd like to provide a quick update on our annual production capacity plans for key programs. PAC-3 is currently at 500 missiles, growing to 550 in 2025, and 650 by 2027. GMLRS currently is at 10,000 missiles, growing to 14,000 by 2025.\n\nJASSM, LRASM currently at about 650 missiles, growing to 1,100 by 2026, and HIMARS currently at 72 launchers, growing to 96 next year. Shifting to rotary emission systems on Chart 7. Sales increased 16% in the quarter, 8% normalized for the extra week, driven by higher volume across the entire portfolio, including radar and laser programs within integrated warfare systems and sensors, various programs within C6ISR and the CH-53K and Seahawk programs within Sikorsky. Operating profit increased 23% due to higher volume and favorable contract mix, partially offset by lower profit adjustments. Finally, with space on Chart 8, sales increased 10% year-over-year, 2% normalized for the extra week to approximately $3.3 billion. The growth was driven by higher volume on the fleet ballistic missile program and ramp ups on hypersonic and next-generation interceptor programs within strategic and missile defense, as well as higher volume on space development agency transport and tracking layer programs within national security space.\n\nOperating profit increased 16% compared to Q1 2023, driven by higher volume and ULA equity earnings, partially offset by lower net profit adjustments, primarily on the Next-Gen OPIR program. Now, I'll turn it back to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.\n\nJay Malave: Thanks, Maria. Let's turn to the outlook on Chart 9. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin\u2019s 2024 financial outlook remain unchanged from what we said in January. With the strong first quarter results positioning us well to achieve the consolidated full year outlook, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, including over $3 billion of independent research and development and capital investments. While the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, support our returns to shareholders, targeting a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth over the longer-term. All right. To close out and summarize on Chart 10, we're off to a solid start in 2024 and remain laser-focused on execution to our customer and programmatic commitments while building momentum towards delivering our full year guidance.\n\nThrough our 1LMX transformation, we are reengineering our internal processes by providing the automations and capabilities needed to drive efficiency, increase velocity and enhance key captures and programs. 1LMX will enable us to combine the depth and breadth of our portfolio with the expertise and dedication of our people to drive 21st Century Security solutions for our customers and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nSee also\n\n12 Best Places to Retire in Puerto Rico and\n\n10 Extreme Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investor Alert: Prepare for the Market Crash With These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "As an investor with significant positions in equities, I am an optimist. However, it\u2019s important to be realistic at the same time. This helps in readjusting the portfolio depending on macroeconomic, geopolitical, and other headwinds. In my view, potential delay in rate cuts is likely to make the market nervous as it might imply a hard landing for the economy. I would therefore look at stocks to buy for a market crash.\n\nI must however add that I see the first-rate cut coming before the Presidential elections. Therefore, there are two strategies that I would consider for the coming quarters. First, buy low-beta blue-chip stocks that would protect the portfolio from capital erosion if there is a 10% to 15% correction in the index.\n\nFurther, look at buying quality growth stocks if the broad markets indeed decline in the coming months. I expect a strong recovery in the markets towards the end of the year. For now, let\u2019s discuss three stocks to buy for a market crash.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nGold has declined from highs with tensions deescalating in the Middle East. I however remain bullish on the precious metal with expansionary policies due later this year. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a blue-chip gold miner that\u2019s worth considering at current levels of $37.5.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that NEM stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.7. With an investment grade balance sheet and quality assets, the gold miner is trading at a valuation gap. Further, the low-beta stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.56%.\n\nAs an overview, Newmont has 128 million ounces of gold reserves. Further, the company has 155 million ounces of gold resources. With quality tier one assets, the company has clear production visibility beyond the current decade.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Newmont reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion last year. With higher realized gold price, it\u2019s likely that EBITDA and cash flows will swell. This will provide flexibility for dividends and aggressive exploration investments.\n\nMerck (MRK) A photo of a Merck & Co Inc (MRK) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMerck (NYSE:MRK) is another quality blue-chip stock with a low-beta and trades at an attractive valuation. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.8, the downside for MRK stock seems capped. Further, the upside potential is significant considering the company\u2019s growth outlook.\n\nThe first point to note is that Merck has a deep pipeline. Currently, 10 programs are under review, 30 in phase three, and 80 in phase two. As new molecular entities are commercialized in the next few years, it will ensure steady growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Merck reported 1% growth in revenue on a year-on-year basis to $60.1 billion. For the current year, growth is likely to accelerate in the range of 4% to 7%. This will be associated with upside in earnings and cash flows. Further, the company expects healthy growth to sustain on the back of the oncology, cardiometabolic, and immunology pipeline.\n\nIn general, pharmaceutical stocks have been depressed after the pandemic. It\u2019s a good opportunity to consider exposure to quality names like Merck.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense spending for 2023 surged by 6.8% on a year-on-year basis to $2.44 trillion. With rising geopolitical tensions, it\u2019s likely that spending will continue to increase at a healthy rate. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is an attractive option among defense stocks.\n\nLMT stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17.7 and offers a dividend yield of 2.72%. Further, the low-beta stock has been sideways for the last 12 months. With positive industry tailwinds, I expect a breakout on the upside.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that be it inflation or recession, global defense spending is immune to these factors. Lockheed Martin is therefore well positioned to grow with a healthy order backlog of $160.6 billion. For the current year, the company has also guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion. This provides flexibility for dividends and investments in next-generation defense technologies. If there is a market crash, make sure you have this stock in your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Conflict Capitalists: 7 Stocks Set to Profit From Worldwide Instability",
        "content": "With geopolitical flashpoints poised to worsen, investors ought to target stocks to buy for global conflict. I don\u2019t look at this theme as advantaging tragedies. Rather, it\u2019s a matter of sensibly adjusting one\u2019s portfolio to reflect rapidly shifting realities.\n\nYes, the headlines have been focused on the Middle East. The tit-for-tat missile attacks that Iran and Israel have launched against each other have rattled nerves. While the current media response from both sides suggest a collective effort to cool tensions, a miscalculation could easily spiral circumstances out of control.\n\nHowever, the big issue in my opinion is the U.S. House of Representatives passing $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. That sends a clear message to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin that the U.S. and western forces will continue to support the embattled nation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHaving no off-ramp (because the government didn\u2019t take it earlier in the conflict), the Russians will continue their belligerence. With that in mind, investors need to get serious about these stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a powerhouse in the aerospace and defense sector. Responsible for developing and manufacturing a variety of weapons systems, it will almost surely play a pivotal role in the preparation for future conflicts. Of course, the defense space presents controversies regarding stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nHowever, in the words of Billy Joel, \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire.\u201d Certain nations unfortunately continue to abide by imperialistic directives. At some point, a major conflict is inevitable. The fundamental justification for supporting U.S. allies and interests abroad is the ability to prosecute violations of the international order from a position of strength.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s easier to put out a house fire than a forest fire. But the prospect of a major conflagration materializing has heightened. Therefore, the need to prepare should bode well for Lockheed Martin.\n\nTo be fair, analysts only rate shares a consensus hold, driven by muted sales growth forecasts. However, it\u2019s my opinion that this dynamic could change in a hurry. Therefore, LMT is one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Mr. Joel is adamant that his generation didn\u2019t start any fires, the reality is that the geopolitical snowballing effect means that we must deal with the consequences today. Defense contractor AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is what happens when strategic efforts of containment and/or de-escalation fails and the bullets start flying. At that point, you need a response and that\u2019s where AeroVironment comes in.\n\nStory continues\n\nI don\u2019t want to use the term to avoid getting pinged by the politically correct algorithms. AeroVironment makes \u201cself-harm\u201d drones if you get my drift. Notably, the company states that its drones were instrumental in changing the Ukraine war\u2019s landscape. With these weapons systems, military operations were able to hit high-value targets while protecting themselves via distance.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate that revenue will hit $708.15 million, up 31% from last year\u2019s print of $540.54 million. That\u2019s a major reason why shares have done so well. Moving forward, experts see a reduced sales growth rate of 13.4% for fiscal 2025.\n\nHowever, I believe with AeroVironment proving itself in combat, demand will be higher than anticipated. That\u2019s why AVAV is one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNot every idea for stocks to buy for global conflict has to involve defense contractors. Given the turmoil that geopolitical flashpoints can cause, the fear trade should cynically blossom. If so, you\u2019ll want to keep close tabs on Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). An exploration, production and mine development specialist, Barrick could benefit from multiple catalysts.\n\nThe first catalyst is an obvious one \u2013 inflation. That\u2019s not just from the geopolitical realm. Rather, the U.S. economy continues to impress analysts with stronger-than-expected jobs reports. While that\u2019s a positive development, it also means that more dollars are chasing after fewer goods. That will likely make the dollar relatively devalued, which may mean higher prices for gold.\n\nSecond, the yellow metal has historically played the role of safe-haven asset. With multiple flashpoints materializing throughout the world, a miscalculation could send matters spiraling out of control. I hate to say it but in many ways, that\u2019s gold positive.\n\nCovering experts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $21.30 average price target. Based on current conditions, it\u2019s an attractive and relevant idea.\n\nSibanye Stillwater (SBSW) Person holding smartphone with logo of South African mining company Sibanye Stillwater Limited on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to gold plays, better options exist than Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW). Sure, the sector suffered from significant challenges related to earlier fears of interest rate hikes. But with inflation proving to be stickier than anticipated, precious metals may enjoy a long relevancy lifespan. However, SBSW stock is attractive not just because of the gold situation but because of the underlying palladium business.\n\nAs an industrial metal, palladium finds significant use in the automotive sector. It\u2019s a critical commodity for the development of catalytic converters. Remember those stories about thieves cutting up exhaust systems? Palladium \u2013 or more specifically its high market value \u2013 is the reason why.\n\nWhat\u2019s really intriguing here on a cynical basis is that electric vehicle sales are suffering. Further, hybrid vehicle demand is skyrocketing, which means palladium demand should rise as well. There\u2019s just one problem: Russia is the world\u2019s biggest producer of palladium.\n\nOf course, the west refuses to do business with the Russians. That means we have to turn to South Africa (where Sibanye is based) for increased palladium production. Do the math. SBSW is one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA technology player, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) specializes in cybersecurity. Per its public profile, the company primarily offers firewall appliances and software. In addition, it provides a security management solution for the global control of network security as a virtual or physical appliance. With cyber threats sprouting in both scope and scale, it\u2019s never been more vital for enterprises to protect themselves.\n\nFundamentally, PANW is easily one of the stocks to buy for global conflict. Unlike prior geopolitical flashpoints, the fighting doesn\u2019t just occur in the physical paradigm. Rather, combatants and their advocates engage in an informational war. A clear example of this is Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. The Federal Bureau of Investigation seeks to arrest multiple Russian agents for conspiracy charges.\n\nFurther, data from Statista reveals that Russia is the major source of phishing attacks around the globe. With that, analysts unsurprisingly see 15.9% growth in the top line to $7.99 billion for fiscal 2024. Next year, this figure could rise to $9.13 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStructured as a real estate investment trust or REIT, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) mixes an old-school business model with modern security services. Per its corporate profile, Iron Mountain is a global leader in information management services. Originally, it started as a platform for protecting its clients\u2019 documents and assets. Later on, it began providing digital storage and security solutions.\n\nIn any scenario, it\u2019s vital for enterprises \u2013 especially government agencies \u2013 to keep important documents and records away from the source infrastructure. You just never know what might happen, from accidents to environmental calamities. Further, the geopolitical backdrop suggests that adversarial nations and entities can attempt to compromise American businesses and infrastructure. Therefore, document and asset storage and protection has never been more important.\n\nNotably, this dynamic has not been ignored on Wall Street. Instead, experts anticipate that current fiscal year revenue could hit $6.09 billion. If so, we\u2019re talking about an 11.1% growth rate from last year\u2019s print of $5.48 billion. Lastly, IRM carries a unanimous strong buy rating. So, it\u2019s a great candidate for stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFocused on the consulting services sector, Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) provides management and technology consulting, analytics, engineering, digital solutions, mission operations, and cyber services to governments, corporations, and not-for-profit organizations. Primarily, BAH is a candidate for stocks to buy for global conflict due to its relevance in the information war space.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, Booz Allen addresses the Department of Defense\u2019s most vital challenges. In particular, the technology consultation firm provides command, control and communications and battle management. In addition, the firm helps in the field of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, along with electronic warfare. That\u2019s going to be especially crucial given the cunning nature of modern-day threats.\n\nRecently, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that China is developing the \u201cability to physically wreak havoc on our critical infrastructure at a time of its choosing.\u201d Therefore, it\u2019s essential to have a response ready.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) came out with quarterly earnings of $6.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.80 per share. This compares to earnings of $6.43 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this aerospace and defense company would post earnings of $7.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.90, delivering a surprise of 8.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nLockheed , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, posted revenues of $17.2 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.21%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.13 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nLockheed shares have added about 1.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Lockheed?\n\nWhile Lockheed has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lockheed: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $6.45 on $16.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $26.13 on $69.43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense is currently in the bottom 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 6.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nRocket Lab USA, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $95.83 million, up 74.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $6.33 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.80 by 9.1%. The bottom line, however, declined 1.6% from the year-ago quarter's recorded figure of $6.43.\n\nThe company reported GAAP earnings of $6.39 per share compared with $6.61 in the prior-year period.\n\nOperational Highlights\n\nNet sales were $17.20 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion by 6.2%. The top line also increased 13.7% from $15.13 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe year-over-year top-line improvement can be attributed to sales growth from all of the four segments of Lockheed.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lockheed Martin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lockheed Martin Corporation Quote\n\nBacklog\n\nLMT\u2019s backlog as of Mar 31, 2024, was $159.37 billion compared with $160.57 billion at the end of fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nOur model projected a backlog worth $161.58 billion for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Aeronautics segment accounted for $57.04 billion of this amount, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $38.03 billion. The Space, and the Missiles and Fire Control segments contributed $33.01 billion and $31.30 billion, respectively.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nAeronautics: Sales improved 9% year over year to $6.85 billion, driven by higher sales from F-35, F-16 and classified programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit improved 0.5% year over year to $679 million. The operating margin, however, contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 9.9%.\n\nMissiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales improved a solid 25.3% year over year to $3 billion. This was on account of higher sales from tactical and strike missile programs as well as integrated air and missile defense programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit decreased 17.5% year over year to $311 million. The operating margin of 10.4% deteriorated 540 bps from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nSpace: Sales increased 10.5% year over year to $3.27 billion due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, as well as national security space programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit improved 16.1% to $325 million. The operating margin expanded 40 bps to 9.9% in the quarter under review.\n\nRotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly revenues improved 16.5% to $4.09 billion on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by higher net sales from integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs, along with various C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) programs. Higher net sales from Sikorsky helicopter programs also aided this segment\u2019s top line.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 22.9% to $430 million in the reported quarter. The operating margin expanded 50 bps to 10.5% in the same time frame.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nLockheed\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.79 billion at the end of first-quarter 2024 compared with $1.44 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nCash from operating activities amounted to $1.64 billion as of Mar 31, 2024, compared with $1,56 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nLong-term debt as of Mar 31, 2024, totaled $19.25 billion, up from $17.29 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nLockheed has reiterated its financial guidance for 2024. The company still expects revenues in the range of $68.50-$70.00 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $69.43 billion, which lies higher than the mid-point of the company\u2019s guided range.\n\nLMT continues to expect to generate earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $25.65-$26.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s full-year EPS is pinned at $26.13, higher than the mid-point of the company\u2019s guidance.\n\nLockheed still expects to generate free cash flow in the range of $6.00-$6.30 billion during 2024.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nLMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "By Shivansh Tiwary and Mike Stone\n\nApril 23 (Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Lockheed Martin on Tuesday reported a near 14% rise in first-quarter sales, as simmering geopolitical tensions prompt some countries to boost their defense spending, driving demand for new weapons.\n\nSales in its missiles and fire control unit jumped 25.3% to nearly $3 billion, boosted by strong demand for high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS) and guided multiple launch rocket system (GMLRS), key weapons used by Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.\n\nSales in its aeronautics business, the company's biggest unit that makes the F-35 fighter jets, rose 9.2% to $6.85 billion.\n\n\"These first quarter results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve the full year financial expectations we set in January,\" Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said in a statement.\n\nThe missile maker reaffirmed its full-year outlook, projecting net sales of $68.5 billion to $70 billion and profit between $25.65 and $26.35 per share.\n\nQuarterly net sales rose to $17.2 billion from $15.13 billion reported last year.\n\nLockheed's earnings are seen as a bellwether for the arms sector. Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics are due to report quarterly results later this week.\n\nHowever, net income for the quarter ended March 31 fell to $1.55 billion, or $6.39 per share, compared with $1.69 billion, or $6.61 per share, from a year earlier, due to higher costs stemming from labor and supply chain challenges.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said Lockheed won a $17 billion contract to develop the next generation of interceptors to defend the United States against an intercontinental ballistic missile attack.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected. It is the company's practice not to incorporate adjustments into its financial outlook for proposed or potential acquisitions, divestitures, ventures, pension risk transfer transactions, financing transactions, changes in law, or new accounting standards until such items have been consummated, enacted or adopted. For additional factors that may impact the company's actual results, refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section in this news release.\n\n(in\u00a0millions, except per share data) 2024 Outlook1 Net sales $68,500 - $70,000 Business segment operating profit2 $7,175- $7,375 Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment3 ~$1,685 Diluted earnings per share4 $25.65 - $26.35 Cash from operations $7,750 - $8,050 Capital expenditures ~$1,750 Free cash flow2 $6,000 - $6,300 1 The company's current 2024 financial outlook does not include any future gains or losses related to changes in valuations of the company's\r\nnet assets and liabilities for deferred compensation plans or early-stage company investments. The company's financial outlook reflects no\r\nsignificant reduction in customer budgets or changes in priorities, continued support and funding of the company's programs, and a statutory \r\ntax rate of 21%. In addition, the outlook includes known impacts from inflationary pressures and labor and supply chain challenges at the time \r\nof this news release and experienced to date. 2 Business segment operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. See the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of \r\nthis news release for more information. 3 The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment is presented as a single amount and includes total expected U.S. Government cost accounting\r\nstandards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $1.7 billion. Total expected financial accounting standards (FAS) pension income is not\r\nsignificant. For additional detail regarding the pension amounts reported in operating and non-operating results, refer to the supplemental table\r\nincluded at the end of this news release. 4 Although the company typically does not update its outlook for proposed changes in law, the above includes the effect of Notice 2023-63\r\nconfirming that certain expenditures incurred in the performance of cost-type contracts are not subject to capitalization. The company believes \r\nincorporating the clarification from the Notice more accurately reflects its expectations because the Notice describes the tax treatment of \r\ncertain expenditures in accordance with the company's analysis of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nCash Flows and Capital Deployment Activities\n\nCash from operations in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.6 billion and capital expenditures were $378\u00a0million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.3 billion. The operating and free cash flows for the first quarter of 2024 were comparable to the same period in 2023.\n\nThe company's cash activities in the quarter ended March\u00a031, 2024, included the following:\n\npaying cash dividends of $780 million; paying $1.0 billion to repurchase 2.3 million shares; and receiving net proceeds of $2 billion from a debt issuance of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Notes due 2029, $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.80% Notes due 2034 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Notes due 2064.\n\nSegment Results\n\nThe company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. The following table presents summary operating results of the company's business segments and reconciles these amounts to the company's consolidated financial results.\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended March 31,\n\n2024 March 26,\n\n2023 Net sales Aeronautics $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,845 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,269 Missiles and Fire Control 2,993 2,388 Rotary and Mission Systems 4,088 3,510 Space  3,269 2,959 Total net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17,195 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,126 Operating profit Aeronautics $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 679 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 675 Missiles and Fire Control 311 377 Rotary and Mission Systems  430 350 Space  325 280 Total business segment operating\n\nprofit 1,745 1,682 Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment  406 415 Intangible asset amortization\n\nexpense (61) (62) Other, net (61) 2 Total unallocated items 284 355 Total consolidated operating profit $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,029 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,037\n\nNet sales and operating profit of the company's business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes the company's share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of the company's business segments.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, intangible asset amortization expense, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item \"Unallocated items\" between operating profit from the company's business segments and its consolidated operating profit.\n\nChanges in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume, contract mix, and/or performance (referred to as profit adjustments). Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. Contract mix refers to changes in the ratio of contract type or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production and/or sustainment).\u00a0In addition, comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the company's contracts. Increases in profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes.\n\nThe company's consolidated net favorable profit booking rate adjustments represented approximately 11% and 25% of total segment operating profit in the quarters ended March\u00a031, 2024 and March\u00a026, 2023. The decrease in the net favorable profit booking rate adjustments was driven by a $100 million reach-forward loss recognized on a classified program at MFC after updating the company's assessment of the likelihood that the options may be exercised and concluded that an option would be exercised based on progress made on the program and discussions with the customer. In addition to this reach-forward loss, net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were lower by $120 million, see the discussion below.\n\nAeronautics\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended March 31,\n\n2024 March 26,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,845 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,269 Operating profit 679 675 Operating margin 9.9\u00a0% 10.8\u00a0%\n\nAeronautics' net sales in the first quarter of 2024 increased $576 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $305 million on the F-35 program due to higher volume on production, development and sustainment contracts; $155 million on classified programs driven by higher volume; and $60 million on the F-16 program due to the ramp up on production.\n\nAeronautics' operating profit in the first quarter of 2024 was comparable to the same period in 2023. Operating profit increased $50 million on the F-16 program as operating profit for the first quarter of 2023 reflects the impact of unfavorable profit adjustments on a production contract and sustainment contracts as a result of schedule delays related to software and technical specification risks that did not recur in the first quarter of 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower operating profit of $30 million on the F-35 program primarily due to lower net profit adjustments on production contracts as a result of higher than anticipated material costs, partially offset by higher volume described above. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $40 million lower in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nMissiles and Fire Control\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended March 31,\n\n2024 March 26,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,993 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,388 Operating profit 311 377 Operating margin 10.4\u00a0% 15.8\u00a0%\n\nMFC's net sales in the first quarter of 2024 increased $605 million, or 25% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $460 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to production ramp up on Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) programs; and $100 million for integrated air and missile defense programs primarily due to higher volume on PAC-3 and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD).\n\nMFC's operating profit in the first quarter of 2024 decreased $66 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit for tactical and strike missile programs due to a $100 million reach-forward loss recognized for an option on a classified program and an unfavorable profit adjustment on HELLFIRE as a result of additional costs expected to\u00a0be incurred associated with a contract claim, partially offset by the production ramp up described above. Total net profit booking rate adjustments, inclusive of the $100 million loss described above, were $120 million lower in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nRotary and Mission Systems\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended March 31,\n\n2024 March 26,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,088 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,510 Operating profit 430 350 Operating margin 10.5\u00a0% 10.0\u00a0%\n\nRMS' net sales in the first quarter of 2024 increased $578 million, or 16% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $295 million on integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to new program ramp up within the laser systems portfolio and higher volume on the Aegis and radar programs; $150 million for various C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) programs due to higher volume; and $100 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher volume on Seahawk and CH-53K programs.\n\nRMS' operating profit in the first quarter of 2024 increased $80 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of $40 million on IWSS programs due to higher volume described above and a favorable profit rate adjustment as a result of the delivery of a ground-based radar which retired the technical risk; and $25 million on Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher volume described above and higher margins due to contract mix, partially offset by unfavorable profit adjustments on Seahawk programs. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $30 million lower in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nSpace\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended March 31,\n\n2024 March 26,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,269 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,959 Operating profit 325 280 Operating margin 9.9\u00a0% 9.5\u00a0%\n\nSpace's net sales in the first quarter of 2024 increased $310 million, or 10%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $140 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume on Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) and ramp up in the hypersonic and Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) development programs; and higher net sales of $115 million for national security space programs due to higher volume on Transport Layer and GPS III programs and ramp up on the Tracking Layer program.\n\nSpace's operating profit in the first quarter of 2024 increased $45 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to $30 million of higher equity earnings from the company's investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA) due to higher launch volume, and higher operating profit of $20 million on strategic and missile defense programs due to the higher volume described above. These increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of $25 million for national security space programs due to the impact of lower net favorable profit adjustments on Next Gen OPIR as a result of the timing of the award and incentive fee assessments. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $30 million lower in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal equity earnings/(losses) (primarily ULA) represented approximately $15 million or 5% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $(15) million or (5)% for the same period in 2023.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe company's effective income tax rate was 15.8% and 15.3% for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and March 26, 2023. The rates for all periods benefited from research and development tax credits, tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, dividends paid to the company's defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and employee equity awards.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis news release contains the following non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures (as defined by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation G). While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating the financial performance of the company, this information should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's definitions for non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies or analysts.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit\n\nBusiness segment operating profit represents operating profit from the company's business segments before unallocated income and expense. This measure is used by the company's senior management in evaluating the performance of its business segments and is a performance goal in the company's annual incentive plan. Business segment operating margin is calculated by dividing business segment operating profit by sales. The table below reconciles the non-GAAP measure business segment operating profit with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, consolidated operating profit.\n\n(in millions) 2024 Outlook Business segment operating profit (non-GAAP) $7,175 - $7,375 FAS/CAS operating adjustment1 ~1,625 Intangible asset amortization expense ~(245) Other, net ~(400) Consolidated operating profit (GAAP) ~$8,155 - $8,355 1 Reflects the amount by which expected total CAS pension cost of $1.7 billion, exceeds the expected FAS pension service cost and excludes\r\nexpected non-service FAS pension income. Refer to the supplemental table \"Selected Financial Data\" included in this news release for a \r\ndetail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.\n\nFree cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is cash from operations less capital expenditures. The company's capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). The company uses free cash flow to evaluate its business performance and overall liquidity and it is a performance goal in the company's annual and long-term incentive plans. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions or other investments. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and pension contributions.\n\nAdjusted earnings before income taxes; adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS\n\nEarnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were impacted by certain non-operational items for all periods. Management believes the presentation of these measures adjusted for the impacts of these non-operational items is useful to investors in understanding the company's underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period. The tax effects related to each adjustment that impacted earnings before income taxes are based on a blended tax rate that combines the federal statutory rate of 21% plus an estimated state tax rate.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation will webcast live the earnings results conference call (listen-only mode) on Tuesday, April 23, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. ET on the Lockheed Martin Investor Relations website at www.lockheedmartin.com/investor.

cyber or other security threats or other disruptions faced by the company or its suppliers; the company's ability to implement and continue, and the timing and impact of, capitalization changes such as share repurchases, dividend payments and financing transactions; the accuracy of the company's estimates and projections; changes in pension plan assumptions and actual returns on pension assets; cash funding requirements and pension risk transfers and associated settlement charges; realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures, investments, joint ventures, teaming arrangements or internal reorganizations, and market volatility affecting the fair value of investments that are marked to market; the company's efforts to increase the efficiency of its operations and improve the affordability of its products and services, including through digital transformation and cost reduction initiatives;

        "content": "Ducommun Incorporated\n\nSANTA ANA, Calif., April 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ducommun Incorporated\u00a0(NYSE: DCO) (\u201cDucommun\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a global supplier of innovative electronic and structural solutions for the aerospace & defense industry, today announced that it has been recognized as part of an elite group of top performing suppliers by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (NYSE:LMT) for 2023 as a recipient of the Elite Supplier Award.\n\nThe recognition is based on Ducommun having achieved outstanding performance levels in quality and delivery throughout 2023 and with the 2023 Gulfstream Supplier of the Year honor, which was also awarded to DCO in April, is the second significant customer recognition for delivering exceptional performance and value in all areas.

        "content": "In recent years, investors have looked to the sky with hopes of exponential returns. Outer space has yet to be thoroughly explored or even understood, and that unknown quantity is what is so appealing to investors. Whether it is dreaming about space tourism or using the skies for free, high-speed internet, companies are racing to stake their claim in the heavens above.\n\nDoes that mean space stocks are a good investment? Potentially. Two of the three stocks on this list are blue-chip defense and aerospace titans while the other is an upstart communications company. All three of them have caught the eye of Wall Street analysts as strong buy space stocks for April. Here is why the sky is the limit when it comes to investing in Wall Street\u2019s favorite space stocks.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an American aerospace and defense company that was founded in 1995 following the merger of the Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta. With geopolitical tensions rising around the world, LMT stock has seen a slew of analyst upgrades including seven strong buy ratings in April. Lockheed Martin is currently trading nearly 10% below the average price target of $484.55.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpace is one of the four pillars that Lockheed Martin is built on. Lockheed Martin has partnered with both governments and commercial companies to build vehicles for space exploration. This includes Nasa\u2019s Orion Spacecraft which is designed to bring humans to Mars and beyond. Lockheed Martin spacecraft have already traveled to different planets eight times, with over one million hours of spacecraft operations.\n\nLMT\u2019s stock might look expensive, but it\u2019s not relative to the strength of the business. Shares are trading at just 1.7x sales and 17.8x forward earnings. Revenue growth can be slow with defense companies, although steady enough for LMT to pay out a 2.8% dividend yield.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is the eighth-largest aerospace company in the world by market cap. It is another favorite of analysts on Wall Street who have given NOC ten buy ratings for April, four of which are strong buys for this space stock. The price currently sits below the average price target of $489.74 and about 25% below the street-high price target of $615.00.\n\nThis aerospace company is best known for military vehicles like the B2 Stealth Bomber and the F-35 and F-5 fighter jets. As for space, Northrop Grumman created the award-winning James Webb space telescope and also helped to build the International Space Station and the ships involved in the Apollo moon landings.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust as with Lockheed Martin, this stock trades at very low price multiples. Shares are trading at 1.7x sales and 18.7x forward earnings. Revenue growth also matches Lockheed Martin\u2019s at a 5.0% CAGR over the past five years. The growth isn\u2019t exciting, but it is enough for Northrop to pay out a 1.64% dividend yield to shareholders.\n\nAST Spacemobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST Spacemobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) is a Texas-based satellite service provider that was founded in 2017. You wouldn\u2019t know it by the stock\u2019s recent performance, but Wall Street analysts have high hopes for ASTS. The current price of $2.13 is well below the average analyst target of $12.68. Even more encouraging is the five buy ratings the stock received in March.\n\nThis company is a direct competitor to firms like SpaceX brand Starlink. It aims to provide a satellite constellation network based in space to provide high-speed 5G service worldwide.\n\nWhile these deals are promising, you do have to realize that AST Spacemobile is a pre-revenue company. There isn\u2019t much to value the stock by other than the future potential of its business. Shares trade at 17.6x sales and obviously, there isn\u2019t a price-to-earnings ratio without earnings. Still, at just $2.13 per share, AST Spacemobile has the potential to provide otherworldly returns in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)",
        "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Lockheed Martin is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.26 = US$9.1b \u00f7 (US$52b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nTherefore, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 26%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.7% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Lockheed Martin compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Lockheed Martin .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Lockheed Martin Tell Us?\n\nThings have been pretty stable at Lockheed Martin, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So it may not be a multi-bagger in the making, but given the decent 26% return on capital, it'd be difficult to find fault with the business's current operations. This probably explains why Lockheed Martin is paying out 49% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, Lockheed Martin isn't compounding its earnings but is generating decent returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 61% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more thing to note, we've identified  2 warning signs  with Lockheed Martin and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

This system is designed to simplify mission operations through adaptable beamforming tiles, which are essential for effective ground communication.\r\n\r\nBlueHalo secured a contract worth $1.4 billion for the SCAR program in 2022 from the Space Rapid Capabilities Office, an arm of the USSF. BlueHalo has already demonstrated target tracking and signal processing using Multi-band Software Defined Antenna tiles deployed in its BADGER product.\r\n\r\nMercury is currently leveraging its Quartz RFSoC and Navigator Design Suite to deliver hardware for the BADGER system, building on an initial contract from 2023.

The consensus mark for loss is pegged at 66 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 166%.\r\n\r\nMercury has secured a $31 million contract from L3Harris Technologies to supply data recorders for the U.S. Space Development Agency's satellite constellation project. L3Harris Technologies was chosen earlier this year to create 18 satellites for the Tranche 2 Tracking Layer program, which aims to offer global missile warning and tracking capabilities. This initiative is part of the broader Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture that involves deploying military satellites in Low Earth Orbit for various missions.\r\n\r\nMRCY has collaborated with Lockheed Martin to boost defense technology production in Switzerland. This project is a direct result of the offset program between Lockheed Martin and the Swiss government as part of Switzerland\u2019s acquisition of the F-35 Lightning II. It will be facilitated by transferring armasuisses' two crucial security-related technologies, such as software-defined radio technologies and cryptology, to the Swiss industry.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have plunged 22.6% year to date against the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 7.8% due to stiff competition in the market from Kratos Defense & Security Solutions KTOS and Lockheed Martin.

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy as High Inflation Persists",
        "content": "Inflation in the United States has been stubborn and a matter of concern for policymakers. For March, the consumer price increase rose by 3.5% on a year-on-year basis, which was more than expected. That dashed hopes of an interest rate cut relatively soon. If GDP growth disappoints, concerns related to a potential hard landing will increase. From an investment perspective, the scenario calls for exposure to blue-chip stocks for inflation and possible market volatility.\n\nAn important point to note is that rate cuts can potentially boost GDP growth. At the same time, easy money policies are positive for the markets. Therefore, if rate cuts continue to be delayed, there will likely be a correction. That strengthens the case for investing in low-beta blue-chip stocks.\n\nI must, however, add that I believe the first-rate cut will likely be before the presidential election. Therefore, any correction of 5% or 10% would be a good opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. For now, let\u2019s discuss three blue-chip stocks for inflation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe defense sector is immune to factors of inflation or recession. As a matter of fact, global defense spending increased even during the pandemic year. With heightened geopolitical tensions, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a good stock to consider.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that LMT stock has remained sideways for the last 12 months. The stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17.5 and offers a dividend yield of 2.76%. Considering the valuations, I expect a strong breakout on the upside.\n\nLockheed ended Q4 2023 with a strong order backlog of $160.6 billion. The company\u2019s order backlog has continued to swell and points to accelerated revenue growth in the coming quarters.\n\nThe company has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion for the year. There is clear visibility for dividends, share repurchase and investment in R&D. I must add that with a portfolio of advanced defense technology solutions, Lockheed is ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation-driven growth.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe biopharmaceutical sector is also immune to factors of recession or high inflation. However, the sector has been depressed after the pandemic. I see that as a good buying opportunity in some quality biopharmaceutical stocks.\n\nAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.3. Further, the stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.12% and I am bullish on healthy total returns in the next 24 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecific to the business, AstraZeneca has a strong pipeline of clinical candidates. Currently, 178 projects are in the pipeline, with 17 new molecular entities in the late stage. That provides revenue growth visibility, with several late-stage candidates having blockbuster potential.\n\nBesides the product pipeline, AstraZeneca has a diversified geographic presence. That is another catalyst for growth. As an example, the company\u2019s emerging market growth was 20%. However, excluding China, growth in EMs was 35% on a year-on-year basis.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocks\n\nSource: Alexander Limbach / Shutterstock\n\nEven with the possibility of delay in rate cuts, gold continues to trade near $2,400 an ounce. There are multiple reasons for the bullish trend in gold. First, rate cuts are coming, even if it\u2019s towards the end of the year. Further, geopolitical tensions are positive for precious metals. It\u2019s worth noting that central banks continue to buy gold to diversify their reserves.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s a good time to remain invested in gold miners. Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is among the attractive names to consider and looks undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.9. GOLD stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.40%, and I expect healthy dividend growth.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Barrick reported Q1 2024 production that was lower than Q4 2023. However, this was due to \u201cplanned maintenance at Nevada Gold Mines and mine sequencing at various sites.\u201d As production inches higher in the coming quarters, I expect GOLD stock to rally.\n\nFurther, higher realized gold prices will imply healthy cash flows. Last year, Barrick reported operating cash flow of $3.7 billion. The current year OCF will likely be more than $4.5 billion. That will provide ample headroom for dividend growth and aggressive exploration investments.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The 2024 U.S. presidential election season is heating up, and the primary season is wrapping up. Yet, no matter whether you are a Democrat, Republican, Independent or none of the above, election-year stocks could be a great opportunity for your portfolio.\n\nEven before ballots are cast on Nov. 5, 2024, many stocks with election-related catalysts will likely make big moves in anticipation of the results. As you would expect, some stocks stand to gain if it appears likely that presumptive Republican party candidate Donald Trump will win a second, non-consecutive term as President.\n\nThere are stocks poised to gain if it becomes apparent that the presumptive Democratic party nominee, Joe Biden, will win re-election. Alongside these more result-dependent election-year plays, there are also stocks that, irrespective of who wins in November, stand to gain over the next four years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLook at these three election-year stocks and see why each may be a buy ahead of November.\n\nGeo Group (GEO) Operated by the for-profit prison company The GEO Group. GEO stock.\n\nSource: JosephRouse / Shutterstock\n\nGeo Group (NYSE:GEO) lost big when the Democrats won back the White House in the 2020 Presidential elections. Shortly after his inauguration, President Biden issued an executive order that phased out the use of private prison operators like Geo to manage Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities.\n\nWhile not affecting all of Geo\u2019s business, this EO was perceived to threaten this debt-laden company\u2019s prospects. As a result, GEO stock dipped to multi-decade lows. However, since 2021, Geo shares have bounced back in a big way, especially this year.\n\nThe company has won new contracts with other federal agencies. Geo has also been successfully refinancing its outstanding debt. Yet what\u2019s been really pushing GEO higher has been Trump\u2019s poll numbers, which suggest he could win back the White House. GEO could keep rising if this trend continues, as a Republican administration would likely revoke the EO above.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the bipartisan election-year stocks, look no further than Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). After the election, the occupant of the White House could change, but what will not change is the continued increase in geopolitical strife.\n\nThis includes growing tensions between the U.S. and China and the Russia-Ukraine and Mideast conflicts. With defense spending by the U.S. and its Western allies set to keep rising, leading defense contractor Lockheed Martin is likely to continue delivering fiscal results that exceed expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Besides this geopolitical catalyst, which could drive earnings growth and share price appreciation for years, LMT stock is also appealing for its dividend growth track record. Shares currently yield 2.77%, yet LMT\u2019s payouts have increased by an average of 7.93% annually over the past five years.\n\nSturm Ruger (RGR) An LCP Custom handgun manufactured by Sturm Ruger (RGR).\n\nSource: Susan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com\n\nSturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) is one of the election-year stocks to buy if you\u2019re betting on a \u201cblue wave\u201d this November. Firearm sales exploded during the pandemic era, but demand began to decline starting in 2022. Since then, the slowdown has persisted.\n\nThis has, in turn, resulted in declining sales and profitability for Sturm Ruger. That\u2019s why RGR stock, which in 2021 briefly hit prices north of $80 per share, has tumbled to around $45 per share today. However, if Biden wins re-election, especially if the Democratic Party wins back the House of Representatives, giving it full control of Congress, we could see a further push for gun control legislation.\n\nMuch like during the Obama years, renewed fears of a \u201cgun grab\u201d may emerge. If polls start swinging back in favor of the Democrats, RGR and other firearm stocks could begin to rally again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in GEO.

        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Lockheed Martin (LMT) will announce quarterly earnings of $5.80 per share in its forthcoming report, representing a decline of 9.8% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $16.07 billion, increasing 6.3% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone a downward revision of 0.3% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Lockheed metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net sales- Aeronautics' of $6.58 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +4.9% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net sales- Rotary and Mission Systems' to reach $3.69 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +5.2% year over year.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Net sales- Missiles and Fire Control' to come in at $2.60 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +8.7% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Net sales- Space' will reach $3.06 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Operating Profit- Aeronautics' will reach $643.71 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $675 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Operating Profit- Space' reaching $276.47 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $280 million.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Operating Profit- Rotary and Mission Systems' will likely reach $404.37 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $350 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Operating Profit- Missiles and Fire Control' at $292.25 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $377 million.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Lockheed here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Lockheed have returned +3.6% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change.

It is also responsible for the required laboratories, machine and metal shops, tooling, tool cribs, aircraft parts, aircraft ancillary equipment and support equipment.\r\n\r\nWork related to this deal will be performed at Patuxent River, MD.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Boeing?\n\nOf late, military aircraft have been gaining prominence and significant traction globally due to the advancements of new tactical, logistical and other important features along with the ongoing conflicts.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Boeing\u2019s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet, the backbone of the U.S. Navy, is a highly capable and affordable tactical aircraft. The EA-18G Growler, a variant of the F/A-18F, provides critical electronic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data to other joint force aircraft. In 2023, Boeing successfully delivered 22 F/A-18 models, from which one can gauge the solid demand that these jets enjoy in the combat aircraft market.\r\n\r\nThe latest contract win is another testament to that. Such contract wins tend to boost the company\u2019s operating results from the Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment, which witnessed an 8% yearly improvement in 2023.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nPer a report from Mordor Intelligence, the global military aviation market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.23% in the 2024-2030 period.\r\n\r\nSuch projections indicate immense opportunities for Boeing to reap the benefits of military aviation market expansion. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the P-8, F-15, C-17 Globemaster III and T-7A Red Hawk, apart from F/A-18 and EA-18G. In 2023, Boeing delivered 9 F-15s, 3 T-7A Red Hawk and 11 P-8 models. The BDS unit had a backlog of $59.01 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nA few other defense players that can gain from the growing military aviation market are Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Airbus Group EADSY.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman has built some of the world\u2019s most advanced combat aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. The Aeronautics segment witnessed a higher volume of restricted programs as well as the Triton and E-2 programs in 2023. It ended 2023 with a solid backlog of $19.58 billion.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed is one of the pioneers in the combat aircraft space, with its product portfolio constituting some of the most advanced military aircraft like the F-35, C-130J Super Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor and a few more. The F-35 Lightning II, an international multi-role stealth fighter, comprised 64% of the Aeronautics segment\u2019s total sales. The unit witnessed a 2% increase in 2023 sales due to the ramp-up of the F-16 and other classified programs.\r\n\r\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.7% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nAirbus Group\u2019s military aircraft consists of the A400M, the C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. Along with this, Airbus provides world-class customer support. As of Mar 31, 2024, Airbus delivered 1,783 aircraft globally.\r\n\r\nEADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate is 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 9.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past month, shares of BA have lost 6% compared with the industry\u2019s 7.9% decline.

        "title": "Boeing Heads To Space: Could NASA Deal, Starliner Help Fend Off Airplane Segment Weakness?",
        "content": "Boeing Heads To Space: Could NASA Deal, Starliner Help Fend Off Airplane Segment Weakness?\n\nAirplane maker Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has had a rough 2024 with several setbacks related to safety issues highlighted by its airplanes flown by airline companies.\n\nWhile the company could have a long road ahead of fixing problems and regaining customer trust for its airplanes, Boeing could have an exciting catalyst for an underfollowed company segment.\n\nWhat Happened: Boeing is best known for its airplane division, which has faced several publicly known issues of planes having problems while in the air or shortly after takeoff.\n\nAside from its commercial airplane division, Boeing also operates a Defense, Space & Security segment. This segment includes items made for defense agencies worldwide and also a growing space segment that could have one of the biggest milestones in company history coming up.\n\nOn Tuesday, NASA joined Boeing at its Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility as it moved its Starliner spacecraft from the Kennedy Space Center to a launch site at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station; both are in Florida.\n\nThe space agency was on hand as Boeing's space division connected the Starliner spacecraft to the top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. United Launch Alliance is a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT).\n\nTuesday's event comes ahead of a crew flight test mission done by NASA and Boeing. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will board the Starliner and launch to the International Space Station.\n\nThe liftoff event is scheduled to take place after May 6 at 10:34 p.m. ET or later. Wilmore and Williams will spend a week at the International Space Station before returning with a parachute and airbag-assisted landing planned.\n\nIf the mission is successful, NASA will begin the final step in certifying Boeing's Starliner for crewed missions to the space station.\n\n\"Big day for NASA. Big day for Boeing as we get over to the rocket and mate these things together,\" Wilmore said, as shared by Florida Today. \"Go Starliner.\"\n\nThis marks the third launch for Starliner under the NASA crewed mission deal, with the previous two launches being uncrewed.\n\nStarliner will have the ability to carry up to seven crew members or a mix of crew members and cargo according to Boeing. The company has said that the Starliner spacecraft will be reusable and able to fly up to 10 missions.\n\nRelated Link: Delta Flight Returns To Atlanta After Takeoff: Boeing 757 \u2018Yawing Aggressively\u2019\n\nWhy It's Important: Customer trust has fallen for planes made by Boeing, which could spell trouble for the company moving forward. A new focus on its space program could provide optimism for shareholders and a potential fresh look at the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe commercial airplane segment represented $33.9 billion of the company's $77.8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2023, its largest of three reported segments. The company's Defense, Space & Security segment had revenue of $25.0 billion in 2023 and was its second largest segment.\n\nThe Starliner partnership for crewed missions with NASA is part of a 2014 commercial crew program award in 2014. Boeing's initial contract was good for $4.82 billion, with SpaceX also getting $3.14 billion under the same NASA partnership to take crews to the International Space Station.\n\nSpaceX has taken astronauts to and from the ISS. This would mark the first successful time for Boeing under the partnership.\n\nRevenue was up 8% year-over-year for the Defense, Space & Security segment in 2023, which was the lowest of three segments with Commercial Airplanes up 30% year-over-year and Global Services up 9% year-over-year.\n\nBoeing reports first quarter financial results on April 24. While investors and analysts will be glued to the report to get a sense of the timeline and financial impact of airplane problems, commentary on the space segment and potential future contracts with NASA could be a catalyst not priced into the stock.\n\nBA Price Action: Boeing shares are trading Wednesday down 1.20% at $168.50 versus a 52-week trading range of $167.53 to $267.54. Boeing shares are down 35% year-to-date in 2024 and remain down 17% over the last year.\n\nRead Next: Elon Musk Wants Space Stations On Mars & The Moon: Rival General Motors Could Build Lunar Vehicle That Carries The Astronauts\n\nPhoto: Artist concept shows Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner docking to the International Space Station.

        "title": "Will Solid Segmental Performance Aid Lockheed (LMT) Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT is slated to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 23, before the opening bell.\n\nThe company delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.27% in the last four quarters. Lower equity earnings and higher interest expenses, amid solid sales volume from LMT\u2019s major segments, are likely to have hurt the company\u2019s first-quarter performance.\n\nLet's see how things might have shaped up prior to the announcement.\n\nAeronautics to Post Solid Sales\n\nThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets, and contributes almost 40% to the company\u2019s top line, is likely to deliver impressive first-quarter results.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation Quote\n\nHigher production volumes for the F-16 and classified programs are expected to have benefited this segment\u2019s performance. Solid deliveries of F-35 jets, backed by strong international demand for this program, are likely to have also boosted this segment\u2019s top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aeronautics unit\u2019s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $6,557.2 million, indicating a 4.6% improvement from the prior-year period\u2019s reported figure.\n\nImpressive Projections From Other Segments\n\nThe remaining three segments are also projected to have performed favorably in the first quarter.\n\nAn increase in the production of Next Gen Interceptor, with this program making progress from its successful completion of preliminary design review toward the critical design review milestone, must have boosted LMT\u2019s Space segment\u2019s top line in the first quarter. Higher sales volume from the Fleet Ballistic Missile program might have also contributed favorably to this segment\u2019s revenue growth.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s revenues is pinned at $3,053.7 million, indicating a 3.2% improvement from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nLockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies. A higher sales volume from tactical and strike missile programs is likely to have benefited this unit\u2019s sales performance.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC\u2019s first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $2,593.5 million, indicating an 8.6% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nHigher sales volume from the Sikorsky unit, driven by solid deliveries of Blackhawk helicopters in the international market, might have favorably contributed to the Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment\u2019s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the RMS segment\u2019s first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $3,697.1 million, indicating a 5.3% improvement from the top line registered in the prior-year quarter.\n\nSolid Delivery Projections\n\nFor manufacturing companies like Lockheed, successful delivery of its manufactured goods indicates solid revenue generation. To this end, we notice that our model estimates LMT to have delivered 19 jets in the first quarter. The figure is in line with the company\u2019s first-quarter 2023 delivery numbers.\n\nQ1 Expectations\n\nThe anticipated sales growth in each of LMT\u2019s major segments is likely to have boosted its revenues in the first quarter. Also, solid delivery expectations might have had a favorable impact on the company\u2019s overall sales performance.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $16.05 billion, indicating a 6.1% increase from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nSuch a solid top-line performance is likely to have aided LMT\u2019s first-quarter bottom line. However, lower equity earnings and higher net interest expense might have hurt LMT\u2019s earnings.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the defense giant\u2019s first-quarter earnings is pinned at $5.78 per share, implying a deterioration of 10.1% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lockheed this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is the case here as you will see below.\r\n\r\nLMT has an Earnings ESP of +1.74% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nBelow are three other defense stocks that also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.\r\n\r\nHuntington Ingalls Industries Inc HII is slated to release first-quarter results on May 2. HII has an Earnings ESP of +1.39% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nHuntington Ingalls delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 20.64%. The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.49 per share, while that for sales is pinned at $2.80 billion.\n\nL3Harris Technologies LHX is scheduled to release first-quarter results on Apr 25. LHX has an Earnings ESP of +1.98% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nL3Harris delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 1.53%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX\u2019s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.88 per share, while that for sales is pinned at $5.09 billion.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC is slated to report first-quarter results on Apr 25. NOC has an Earnings ESP of +1.65% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nNOC delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.64%.

        "title": "Earnings Preview: Boeing (BA) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Boeing (BA) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis airplane builder is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $17.98 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 102.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boeing?\n\nFor Boeing, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -18.01%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boeing will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Boeing would post a loss of $0.72 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.47, delivering a surprise of +34.72%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nBoeing doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT), another stock in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $5.80 for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -9.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $16.05 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Lockheed has been revised 0.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.05%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "RTX Is Heading to a Healthy Correction After Outperforming the Competition",
        "content": "Shares of RTX Corp. (NYSE:RTX) have outperformed year to date, but it may be time for a healthy, short-timed correction or a lengthier stagnation until competitors catch up. The defense sector is likely to outperform the broader market due to global tailwinds, but RTX has turned slightly too expensive relative to its competitors after some of the company's 2023 fears started to fade too early, while some key growth blockings remain unresolved.\n\nStock performance\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 11 Warning Signs with RTX.\n\nThe stock has been outperforming the broader defense sector and its direct competitors, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), L3Harris (NYSE:LHX) and Northtrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), by a wide margin. Multiple new price targets have been announced over the last couple of months that contributed in boosting the stock price, despite no real change or improvement in both fundamentals and key challenges the company faced in 2023 when it actually underperformed.\n\nBarclays increased its target price for RTX from $75 to $90 on Jan. 30. Bank of America recategorized the stock from underperform to neutral and its target from $78 to $100 on Jan. 25. UBS Group upped its new target price to $96 from the previous $93 target on Jan. 24. On March 19, it was TD Cowen's turn to raise its outlook for the aerospace and defense company from $106 to $115 with an outperform rating. Lastly, based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has a neutral consensus rating with an average target price of $95.76. Interestingly, the stock is currently trading around $101, which means four of these five new targets are still below the current trading price. RTX Is Heading to a Healthy Correction After Outperforming the Competition\n\nAs you can see in the above chart, the three competitors are essentially flat year to date, while RTX is up by approximately 18.60% after three months of trading. In this discussion, I will explain the reason for the outperformance and why it is paradoxically not the best defense stock to buy right now. Indeed, RTX ended 2023 down 16.60%, underperforming the S&P 500 by more than 40%.\n\nTherefore, I believe the stock's outperformance this year is merely due to a catch-up effect after a year to forget for shareholders, fading fears without actually being resolved and target price hikes powering the stock momentum.\n\nBusiness overview and challenges\n\nRTX is composed of four different businesses: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense.\n\nCollins Aerospace focuses on the manufacturing of aerospace products for commercial, regional, corporate and military aircraft and is also a major supplier for international space programs. Pratt & Whitney designs and builds aircraft engines and gas turbines, while Raytheon Intelligence & Space specializes in communication, sensor systems, cyber and software solutions to governmental and commercial customers. Raytheon Missiles & Defense focuses on missiles and generally everything in relation to detecting and engaging threats.\n\nStory continues RTX Is Heading to a Healthy Correction After Outperforming the Competition\n\nRTX's Pratt & Whitney business discovered a risk of contamination in its powder coating, which is a material used to produce engine turbine discs. This contamination could cause several billion dollars in losses, severely impacting corporate earnings and free cash flow. Given the company has been an important dividend payer to shareholders for decades, any reduction of the dividend payments due to a decline in earnings could quickly initiate a panic spiral among investors - especially when you have alternatives in competitors like Lockheed Martin, L3Harris and Northtrop Grumman that all pay dividends and have similar business cases. Another key concern I have for the company, but applicable to the sector overall, is supply chain and shipping disruptions, as well as rising basic materials prices and labor costs. These disruptions and cost increases have impacted many business across the United States, and the defense sector is not immune.\n\nFinancials and valuation\n\nZooming in on the financials, particularly cash flow, RTX is expected to report disappointing free cash flow growth of 4.50% this year due to the issues I described. This is in stark contrast with 2023, when the company generated cash flow growth of 12%. The markets are forward looking: this year's disappointing figure was probably priced in last year when the stock declined 16.60%. The recent stock rally was powered by markets tabling a whopping 23% free cash flow growth. A lot has to go right for the company to reach that level of growth; high expectations mean the bar is really high and it is not my personal preference when initiating a buying position. Indeed, the company's free cash flow declined 2.60% in 2022 before recovering with 12% growth in 2023. It is expected to have mid-single-digit growth this year.\n\nThe high expectations for next year combined with the current high valuation makes an increase in my position undesirable, so I would prefer to wait for a better entry point. RTX Is Heading to a Healthy Correction After Outperforming the Competition\n\nIndeed, as you can see in the above chart, the stock is currently trading at 18.30 times last 12-month Ebitda as of April 8 (with valuation continuing to spike) while during the pre-Covid (2019) and post-Covid (2021-2023) periods, it was trading around 15. With an enterpise value-to-Ebitda multiple of 15, we would have a current stock price of around $85. A slight premium up to $90 would be acceptable given the sector tailwinds and possible good news on RTX's Pratt & Whitney business.\n\nWhen considering competitors' valuations, we realize that RTX's current valuation may be unjustified. Lockheed Martin is trading at 12.30 times while L3Harris Technologies is at 15.30. Northtrop Grumman is currently trading at 20 times, but this is an anomaly due to a 50% decline in Ebitda last year as the stock was trading in a tight range between 2020 and 2023. The valuation of RTX, therefore, does seem slightly stretched in relation to the sector and the market may have gotten ahead of itself with the high growth tabled for 2025.\n\nFactors that could invalidate my thesis\n\nBecause of its expensive valuation, its powder coating contamination that could delay operations and the political obstruction, namely in the U.S. Congress, I would not initiate a buying position at this stage. However, if you already own the stock as I do - I currently own it with an average purchase price of $87 with four positions ranging from $85 to $90, which is roughly where I currently value it for, in line with competitors - it makes sense to continue holding it if your time horizon is over at least two to three years.\n\nOn top of price, what I want to see before buying again is improving prospects on the existing operational issue at its core segment, Pratt & Whitney, a more detailed plan from management on supply chains and cost management and at least preliminary signs of a consensus between both parties in the U.S. Congress on bills in relation to Ukraine and Israel military or financial support. Given the intense geopolitical situation with the wars in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine, market tailwinds could support the stock price and buy the management team some time to solve the powder coating problem. Furthermore, interest rate cuts by the Fed this year and/or next year could support the current stark valuation, but this scenario remains hypothetical as the U.S. economy continues running strong and inflation shows some signs of rebound since the start of the year.\n\nLast but not least, the strongest argument that convinced me to buy and hold for the long term is the existing management remuneration plan. As Charlie Munger famously declared, \"Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome.\" Below you can see an extract of the incentives plan from the RTX 2024 Annual Proxy Statement. RTX Is Heading to a Healthy Correction After Outperforming the Competition\n\nChristopher Calio is the President and CEO and Gregory H. Hayes is the executive chairman. Respectively 94% and 88% of their pay is based on annual incentives and long-term incentives. These incentives are based on objective criteria such as financial growth, employee retention and energy emissions of the company. These incentives align the management's interests to the shareholders' as the fixed base salary range for the top two individuals is in a very low 6% to 12% range.\n\nBottom line\n\nDepending on your time horizon, I would hold the stock for the longer term, because it is a well-established company with market tailwinds and an incentive plan based on the company's sustainable growth, which puts management's incentives in line with the shareholders'. However, I do feel that the stock got a bit ahead of itself in the first quarter and is trading at a premium to its current fair value, which I would currently estimate to be around $85 to $90 based on multiples historically applied to the stock and the sector. I would, therefore, wait for a correction to initiate a new position.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Steady Income, Steady Growth: 7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Blue-chip dividend stocks have always been relevant. While they\u2019re not the most exciting investments, they provide a steady hand during market uncertainty. This attribute has just become even more critical.\n\nWith an already tense situation in the geopolitical realm boiling over, investors will likely seek reassurances. It doesn\u2019t get much better than established stalwarts that pay consistent and/or reliable passive income. On this note, below are top blue-chip dividend stocks to consider.\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn aerospace and defense contractor, RTX (NYSE:RTX) \u2013 formerly known as Raytheon \u2013 offers several solutions in the military hardware space. It\u2019s a controversial idea in that sense because RTX may rise higher due to tensions in the Middle East. Nevertheless, an attack on a sovereign nation can\u2019t be ignored, which invariably enhances the relevance of RTX stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo be fair, analysts are not exactly bullish on the idea, rating shares a hold with a $96.46 price target. Still, given the recent paradigm shift, this dynamic will likely change. On top of that, the company offers a forward yield of 2.36%. That matches the industrial sector\u2019s average yield. Notably, the payout ratio sits at 38.34%, implying strong confidence in terms of yield sustainability.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for earnings per share of $5.39. That\u2019s a decent improvement over last year\u2019s print of $5.06. As for the top line, they\u2019re targeting $78.73 billion, up 5.9% year-over-year. Again, with circumstances changing for the worse in the geopolitical space, RTX ranks among the blue-chip dividend stocks to consider.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top-tier defense contractor, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) also isn\u2019t quite getting the love from analysts. Presently, LMT comes in as a hold consensus with an average price target of $478.07. The high-side target lands at $540. Still, with the dramatic shift in the landscape in the Middle East, Lockheed will probably garner more positive attention.\n\nIn terms of passive income, the defense and aerospace specialist offers a forward yield of 2.8%. What investors will really appreciate is the track record. Over the past 21 years, it has consistently raised its payout. Further, the payout ratio is reasonable at 45.67%, thus providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.\n\nWhile Lockheed isn\u2019t exactly lighting up the board financially, it\u2019s a consistent performer. In fiscal 2023, the company\u2019s positive earnings surprise came out to 5.33%. For the current fiscal year, covering experts are seeking EPS of $26.04, which is lower than last year\u2019s $27.85.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the top line, though, they\u2019re targeting $69.49 billion, up 2.8% above last year\u2019s $67.57 billion. Again, given the paradigm shift, these estimates could easily rise, making LMT one of the blue-chip dividend stocks to watch.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s pivot away from the controversial defense industry and focus on another relevant space: utilities or specifically regulated electric. With NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), investors receive a broad canvas. First, they stand to benefit from the core business of generating and distributing electric power to retail and wholesale customers. Second, NextEra consistently champions renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nWith any tension in the Middle East comes concerns about the stability of global oil supply chains. So, if the Russian invasion of Ukraine hasn\u2019t taught us anything yet, then certainly Iran\u2019s strike against Israel will. If we continue to depend on fossil fuels, we are vulnerable to volatile, unpredictable geopolitical flashpoints.\n\nRight now, NextEra offers a forward yield of 3.27%, which is a bit lower than the sector average yield of 3.75%. However, the company commands 30 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nTo be upfront, the risk factor is that for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate a 1.3% decline in revenue. However, with the shifting sands, I suspect that analysts will boost their assessments. Thus, NEE is one of the blue-chip dividend stocks to buy.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, I though that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and its ilk sold themselves prior to the Middle East flashpoint. One upside catalyst that has nothing to do with warfare is the impressive U.S. jobs market. With the economy continuing to generate more nonfarm payrolls, the conclusion is rather straightforward: more dollars are chasing after fewer goods. That\u2019s inflationary and that\u2019s cynically good for oil.\n\nHowever, with tensions boiling over in many parts of the world, XOM sells itself as one of the best blue-chip dividend stocks to buy. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $125.31. I\u2019m almost certain this print will rise much higher in the coming months. As for the passive income, Exxon carries a forward yield of 3.16%. While that\u2019s lower than the energy sector\u2019s 4.24% average yield, the oil giant also has increased its payout across 41 years.\n\nIn full disclosure, covering experts right now anticipate declines in fiscal 2024\u2019s earnings and growth projections. However, with the geopolitical shift, the most optimistic forecast of $11.08 EPS on sales of $384.24 billion is probably reasonable.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a stalwart in the grocery supermarket business, Kroger (NYSE:KR) makes a great case for blue-chip dividend stocks. No, it\u2019s not the most exciting place to be as an investor, let\u2019s not kid ourselves. However, it\u2019s likely that should tensions erupt into a protracted conflict in the Middle East, oil supplies will get disrupted. If that happens, it\u2019s not just companies like Exxon Mobil that will benefit from higher profitability potential.\n\nRather, I\u2019m looking at Kroger as a downwind beneficiary. Why? Because if oil prices skyrocket, that means practically everything else will rise in price. After all, your morning cereal probably didn\u2019t arrive at your local Kroger store on a solar-powered truck. And because KR stock represents an indelible investment, people have no choice but to pay up.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. For the current fiscal year, analysts project EPS to reach $4.42 on sales of $148.73 billion. Both stats are down against last year\u2019s results. However, the high-side estimate of $4.49 EPS on revenue of $152.74 billion is likely in the cards.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nEven though the state of humanity is rather depressing at the moment, this framework may surprisingly help fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). We can talk all day about being financially prudent. However, we all need a culinary pick-me-up. The Golden Arches provide just that. Also, it\u2019s a great source for coffee and breakfast on the go, particularly for workers who have to return to the office.\n\nAs a powerhouse on Wall Street, McDonald\u2019s is also a great place for passive income. Currently, the company provides a forward yield of 2.5%. That\u2019s a decent bit above the consumer discretionary industry\u2019s average yield of 1.89%. Better yet, the company enjoys a history of 48 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. If you\u2019re looking for reliable blue-chip dividend stocks, this is it.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS of $12.43. That\u2019s a decent bump up from last year\u2019s print of $11.94. Also, they\u2019re anticipating a top-line print of $26.88 billion or 5.4% above 2023\u2019s result of $25.49 billion. For fiscal 2025, sales are projected to hit $28.5 billion, with the high-side estimate landing at $29.33 billion.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical behemoth, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) presents a compelling case for blue-chip dividend stocks to buy. As I\u2019ve mentioned many times before, AbbVie bought out Allergan. With the acquisition, the pharma now controls the Botox anti-wrinkle treatment. Because social media focuses so much on the superficial and because none of us are getting any younger, ABBV stock could be a huge hit.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a cynical talking point but that\u2019s the world we live in I\u2019m afraid. As for the passive income, the company is the most generous one on this list. It offers a forward yield of 3.82%, well above the healthcare industry\u2019s average yield of 1.58%. Even better, the company features 52 years of consecutive dividend increases.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $181.47 average price target. For the current fiscal year, the experts project EPS of $11.20 on sales of $54.64 billion. To be fair, these are modest gains from last year\u2019s EPS of $11.11 on revenue of $54.32 billion.\n\nStill, if you\u2019re looking for a steady anchor to ride out the storm, AbbVie could be it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q1 Release",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Lockheed Martin (LMT) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $16.05 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.75% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?\n\nFor Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.74%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $7.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.90, delivering a surprise of +8.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nLockheed appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) to Deliver Next-Gen Missile Interceptor to US",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT recently secured a contract from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to develop the nation\u2019s Next Generation Interceptor (NGI). This award should bolster LMT\u2019s position in the rapidly expanding missile defense systems market.\r\n\r\nPer Reuters, this contract is valued at $17 billion.\n\nSignificance of NGI\n\nThe NGI is a modern, never-fail weapon system designed to protect the homeland against increasing and evolving ballistic missile threats. It is equipped with kill vehicle technology and combat-proven exo-atmospheric threat intercept experience.\r\n\r\nThe development of NGI will modernize the United States\u2019 Ground-Based Midcourse Defense program, thereby possessing the ability to defend the nation against an intercontinental ballistic missile attack.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed Martin?\n\nAmid the widespread increase in geopolitical tensions worldwide, nations have been strengthening their defense arsenal manifold in recent times. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation\u2019s defense strategy. The increased missile defense adoption by nations like the United States has been offering prominent missile makers like Lockheed Martin solid growth opportunities.\r\n\r\nNotably, Lockheed Martin\u2019s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor for the development, production and support of equipment for missile defense systems like command and control, battle management and communications (C2BMC) system, apart from NGI. C2BMC is an operationally-proven, layered missile defense system that allows commanders to make synchronized decisions about threats at any range, in any phase of flight, from any location in the world.\r\n\r\nWith such remarkable missile defense products in its portfolio, Lockheed continues to witness solid order flows from the Pentagon and U.S. allies, like the latest one, which should boost revenues for LMT\u2019s Space Systems unit that registered a solid 9% year-over-year growth in 2023.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nPer the latest report from the Research and Markets firm, the global missile and missile defense systems market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.82% over the 2024-2029 period.\r\n\r\nSuch projections exemplify immense opportunities for Lockheed to capitalize on the expanding market. Notably, the company also builds the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared system, which provides the U.S. Space Force with enhanced worldwide missile warning capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe burgeoning growth prospects of the aforementioned market are also likely to benefit other defense majors like Northrop Grumman NOC, RTX Corporation RTX and General Dynamics GD, which have a well-established position in the missile system market.\r\n\r\nNorthrop designs and produces missile products, including advanced high-speed propulsion systems, fuses, warheads and controls for air, sea and land-based systems. Currently, it is building an ultramodern 113,000-square-foot complex in West Virginia to manufacture more advanced defense and strike missiles. Upon completion in 2024, the missile integration facility will support the production of up to 300 strike missiles per year, with an expansion capacity to produce 600 per year.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term (three-to-five-years) earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nRTX is a leading designer, developer, integrator, producer and sustainer of integrated air and missile defense systems. Its product portfolio includes the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, the Guidance Enhanced Missile, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 and a few more.\r\n\r\nRTX\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 10.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 5.7% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems provides missile subsystems in support of U.S. tactical and strategic missiles, provisioning both legacy and next-generation missiles with critical aerostructures, control actuators, high-performance warheads and cutting-edge hypersonic rocket cases. It is the sole producer and system integrator of the 2.75-inch (70mm) Hydra-70 family of rockets.\r\n\r\nGD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past six months, shares of LMT have gained 2.7% against the industry\u2019s 2.1% decline.

        "title": "Investing in Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) five years ago would have delivered you a 64% gain",
        "content": "If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) share price is up 44% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 7.5% in the last year.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Lockheed Martin managed to grow its earnings per share at 10% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Lockheed Martin's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Lockheed Martin the TSR over the last 5 years was 64%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Lockheed Martin had a tough year, with a total loss of 4.9% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 23%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 10% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted  2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin is not the only stock insiders are buying.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) ended the recent trading session at $453.08, demonstrating a +0.6% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.65%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.79%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 3.35% in the past month.

The company plans to announce its earnings on April 23, 2024. On that day, Lockheed Martin is projected to report earnings of $5.78 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 10.11%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $16.05 billion, indicating a 6.12% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $26.13 per share and revenue of $69.42 billion, which would represent changes of -6.07% and +2.74%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Lockheed Martin. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988.

        "title": "Lockheed wins US missile defense contract worth $17 billion",
        "content": "By Mike Stone\n\n(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $17 billion contract to develop the next generation of interceptors that would guard the United States against an intercontinental ballistic missile attack, two industry sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe win represents a shot in the arm for Lockheed after the U.S. said it would start reducing F-35 orders and the Army said in February that it was abandoning development of a Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, a next-generation helicopter for which Lockheed had submitted a design.\n\nThe multi-year contract will be awarded as soon as Monday by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, which is developing the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) to modernize the current Ground-Based Midcourse Defense program, a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nBoth Lockheed and the Missile Defense Agency declined to comment. The sources did not indicate the length of the contract, but the first interceptor is expected to be operational in 2028.\n\nThe NGI is currently in its technology development phase and will transition to its product development phase in May, according to written testimony submitted by the head of the Missile Defense Agency, Lieutenant General Heath Collins, last week.\n\nCollins said the agency would select either Lockheed or Northrop Grumman for the program. The companies were awarded separate contracts in 2021 to develop designs for the missile.\n\nIn 2019, the Pentagon scrapped work on a Boeing Co contract for a \"kill vehicle,\" the tip of an interceptor that detaches in space and \"kills\" the incoming warhead, due to technical design problems after spending $1.2 billion on the project.\n\nThe United States then decided to restart the contract process to gather bids on designing the whole interceptor including the \"kill vehicle.\" Boeing was knocked out of the competition in 2021.\n\nThe next-generation interceptor program would be worth about $17.7 billion over its lifetime according to government estimates, as the contractor works to make the technology capable of defeating current ballistic missile threats and future technological advances from countries including North Korea and Iran.\n\nIn January, Lockheed forecast its 2024 profit below Wall Street expectations, as the defense contractor's largest aeronautics segment that makes the F-35 jets faces supply-chain snags.\n\nReuters has reported that Lockheed would cut 1% of its jobs over the course of 2024 in a bid to cut costs and streamline operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S. defense giants have benefited from robust demand for weapons due to heightened geopolitical tensions over the last two years. Sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments in 2023 rose 16% to a record $238 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington; Writing by Abhijith Ganapavaram; Editing by Chris Sanders and Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "As of late 2023, the US economy seemed poised for a controlled slowdown, with hopes of easing inflation and steadier growth. However, 2024 has brought surprising developments. The economy is booming, and job gains are substantial, but inflation remains persistently high. This divergence from expectations has raised concerns among policymakers, as the U.S. Federal Reserve aims to curb inflation without risking a recession. Uncertainty looms over the outlook for further rate cuts, with speculation emerging about the potential need for rate hikes to address inflationary pressures. This shift has injected a note of caution into economic forecasts for the near future. Knowing that an economic slowdown is imminent, you need to invest in some safety stocks that will boom no matter what. If you manage to snap up these stocks to buy on market dips, you will see your portfolio and be profitable.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.\n\nSource: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an American defense and aerospace company known for its aeronautical research and development.

        "title": "Boeing (BA) Wins $112M Deal to Aid F/A-18 &amp; EA-18G Aircraft",
        "content": "The Boeing Company BA recently clinched a contract for its F/A-18 and E/A-18G aircraft. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $111.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by May 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will be engaged in the production and delivery of avionics long lead time parts and spares related to the F/A-18E/F Block III and E/A-18G aircraft. These spares will support the advanced crew station suite, life of type buys for parts that have or will become obsolete, and special test equipment for aiding the aforementioned jets. \u00a0\r\n\r\nMajority of the work related to this deal will be performed at Berkley, MO, Haifa, Israel and Merrimack, NH. The contract will support the U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and the country of Kuwait.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Boeing?\n\nNations across the globe are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment worldwide. In this context, military aircraft that play a critical role in military missions have also been witnessing a significant rise in demand.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Boeing\u2019s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet, the backbone of the U.S. Navy, is a combat aircraft that delivers cutting-edge, next-generation multi-role strike fighter capability. The EA-18G Growler, a variant of the F/A-18F, provides tactical jamming and electronic protection to the U.S. military forces and allies around the world.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, Boeing successfully delivered 22 F/A-18 models. With this, one can gauge the solid demand that these jets enjoy in the military aircraft market. The latest contract is another testament to that. Such contract wins tend to boost the company\u2019s operating results from the Boeing Defense, Space & Security segment, which ended 2023 with a backlog of $59.01 billion.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nRising military conflicts, terrorism, border disputes, territory invasions and violations have forced nations to increase their defense spending toward procuring combat-proven aircraft to enhance their aerial security in recent times. Per a report from the Expert Market Research firm, the global military aircraft market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.10% in the 2024-2032 period.\r\n\r\nSuch projections indicate immense growth opportunities for prominent combat jet manufacturers like Boeing. The company\u2019s military jet portfolio includes the F-15, P-8, T-7A Red Hawk and C-17 Globemaster III, apart from the F/A-18 and E/A-18G aircraft. On Feb 29, 2024, Boeing secured a $3.4 billion contract from the U.S. Navy for 14 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force and three additional P-8s for the German Navy.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nA few other defense players that can gain from the expanding military aircraft market are Embraer ERJ, Lockheed Martin LMT and Airbus Group EADSY.\r\n\r\nEmbraer\u2019s Defense & Security is a prominent player within the aerospace and defense industry of Latin America. Its product portfolio includes the A-29 Super Tucano light attack and advanced trainer and the C-390 Millennium military multi-mission aircraft. In February 2024, Embraer signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Mahindra to provide the Indian Air Force with the C-390 Millennium.\r\n\r\nERJ boasts a long-term (three-to five-years) earnings growth rate of 17%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 19.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed is one of the pioneers in the combat aircraft space, with its product portfolio constituting some of the most advanced military aircraft like the F-35, C-130, F-16, F-22 and a few more. The Aeronautics segment ended 2023 with a backlog of $60.16 billion. The F-35 Lightning II, an international multi-role stealth fighter, comprised 64% of the segment\u2019s total sales.\r\n\r\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.7% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nAirbus Group\u2019s military aircraft consists of the A400M, the C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. As of Mar 31, 2024, Airbus had 1,445 military aircraft in operation globally.\r\n\r\nEADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate is 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 9.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past month, shares of BA have lost 4.9% compared with the industry\u2019s 5.7% decline.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Wins $4.1B Contract to Upgrade C2BMC System",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently secured a contract involving its command and control, battle management and communications (C2BMC) system. The award has been offered by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $4.1 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 30, 2029, with an option to get extended through Apr 30, 2034. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will develop, model, integrate, test, verify, evaluate, validate, document, deliver, field, train, operate, sustain, and support updates and new capabilities to the C2BMC system.\n\nWork related to this deal will be executed in LMT\u2019s Colorado Springs, CO facility and a new facility in Huntsville, AL.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nAs nations across the globe have been rapidly strengthening their defense arsenal, thanks to widespread unrest witnessed in different parts of the world, the need for improved situational awareness for warfighters has increased manifold. This must have been the primary factor behind the increasing demand for state-of-the-art command and control monitoring systems like Lockheed\u2019s C2BMC. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nNotably, LMT\u2019s C2BMC is an operationally-proven, layered missile defense system that allows commanders to make synchronized decisions about threats at any range, in any phase of flight, from any location in the world.\n\nThe fact that C2BMC has nodes in over 30 locations across more than 48,000 miles of network communication lines surely reflects the solid utility that this product offers to a nation\u2019s missile defense.\n\nConsidering the fact that the future of the evolving battlespace lies within the space domain, Lockheed is likely to outfit C2BMC-Next, the upgraded C2BMC under the latest contract, with technology that provides greater Space Domain Awareness. This should enable C2BMC-Next to offer faster, multi-domain coordinated responses to emerging threats.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead?\n\nThe need for more technologically advanced command and control (C2) monitoring systems has increased over the past few years, owing to notable improvements in communication technologies. Lately, geopolitical events like the Russian invasion in Ukraine and the ongoing unrest in the Middle East between Palestine\u2019s Hamas group and Israeli militants have prompted the need for high-speed, low-latency communication systems.\n\nTo this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm expects the global command and control systems market to witness a CAGR of 2.3% during 2024-2029. This should bode well for Lockheed, with the company focusing on offering full spectrum battle management services for years. These range from enabling the Ballistic Missile Defense System to operate as a global network through C2BMC to aiding the unknown in Space to become known through iSpace.\n\nAs part of the company\u2019s latest development in this domain, in May 2023, Lockheed successfully demonstrated digital C2 to synchronize joint all-domain fires during the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command\u2019s (INDOPACOM) Northern Edge exercise near Alaska. The results are expected to support and shape future joint all-domain command and control (JADC2) capabilities.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other defense majors that enjoy a solid footprint in the C2 systems market and are thus expected to gain from this market\u2019s expansion have been discussed below.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: The company is a critical partner in delivering advanced C4ISR capabilities, systems integration and open architectures across multiple domains. For 60 years, Northrop Grumman has been a leader in the design, development and delivery of end-to-end communications & advanced networking capabilities for U.S. and allied military forces operating across multiple battlespace domains.\n\nThe stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The consensus estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales is pegged at $41.09 billion, indicating an improvement of 4.6% from the previous year\u2019s reported top line.\n\nLeidos Holdings LDOS: It develops primary strategic C2 planning systems, including Aimpoint Construction System, processing the creation of aimpoints for strategic weapon applications and the Attack Structure Manager system. Within the Command, Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) operation, the company provides innovative technologies, unique methodologies, and world-class software and services for customers in the broader intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance community.\n\nThe stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LDOS\u2019 2024 sales is pegged at $15.97 billion, implying an improvement of 3.5% from the previous year\u2019s reported level.\n\nL3Harris Technologies LHX: The company offers a complete maritime domain awareness C2 system. Its Vigilis is an efficient C2 system that monitors the movement of vessels around identified risk areas and regions to improve security and safety. It protects against and alerts to collisions, hostile vessels, smuggling, piracy, illegal immigration, obstruction of sea lanes, and pollution.\n\nThe stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.5%. The consensus estimate for LHX\u2019s 2024 sales is pegged at $21.22 billion, indicating an improvement of 9.3% from the previous year\u2019s reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past six months, shares of LMT have risen 2.5% against the industry\u2019s 0.2% decline.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Lockheed Martin is US$646 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Lockheed Martin is estimated to be 30% undervalued based on current share price of US$455 The US$484 analyst price target for LMT is 25% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.24b US$6.20b US$6.44b US$7.07b US$7.12b US$7.20b US$7.30b US$7.43b US$7.57b US$7.72b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x12 Analyst x12 Analyst x8 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.10% Est @ 1.46% Est @ 1.71% Est @ 1.88% Est @ 2.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3%  US$5.9k US$5.5k US$5.4k US$5.5k US$5.2k US$5.0k US$4.7k US$4.5k US$4.3k US$4.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$50b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.3%\u2013 2.3%) = US$195b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$195b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$105b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$155b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$455, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.882. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "content": "Vltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its first-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be\u00a0downloaded here. The fund doesn\u2019t own any of the currently largest stocks in the portfolio, except for Berkshire. The stocks in the fund's portfolio trade at lower earnings multiples compared to the largest ones. The portfolio stocks have more growth potential, as evidenced by the fund's recent returns. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nVltava Fund featured stocks like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in the first quarter 2024 investor letter. Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a security and aerospace company. On April 5, 2024, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock closed at $455.38 per share. One-month return of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was 4.75%, and its shares lost 8.33% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has a market capitalization of $109.517 billion.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"We sold three positions: Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), LabCorp, and Celanese. Lockheed and LabCorp were two very profitable positions that also helped us when the market was in tough times. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, arms companies\u2019 shares surged upwards for obvious reasons. This was due to higher expectations for their long-term sales and profits. Lockheed\u2019s stock did not miss out on this trend. It climbed to a new record high during 2022, which was all the more pleasing because it happened in a year when stock markets were down significantly. Shares of both LabCorp and Lockheed thus reached levels that made them only modestly attractive going forward, and even their relative valuations were not appealing vis-\u00e0-vis other opportunities open to us. We gradually sold down both stocks, moved the money into other stocks, and eventually both LabCorp and Lockheed disappeared from the portfolio altogether.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo fighter jets in flight, highlighting the technology and experience of the companies combat aircraft.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is not on our list of\u00a030 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value dividend stocks and overall performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nGrowth stocks took the lead in 2023, driven by the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 rally in the tech sector. The whole tech rebound, following a significant downturn the year before, was enough to question the validity of value equities, which historically have shown better performances over the long term, according to analysts. Value stocks are mainly well-established companies that despite having stable business models and sustainable dividends, typically trade at lower prices compared to their intrinsic value, presenting an opportunity for investors to purchase them at a discount. Professor-turned-money manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing expert David Dreman truly believed the \u2018tortoise beats the hare\u2019 approach in investing. Their research suggested that value investing tends to outperform growth about 70% of the time, irrespective of company size. Through meticulous studies covering companies of varying sizes, they found that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year compared to growth stocks over extended time frames.\n\nWhile value stocks may not have performed as well as growth stocks last year, analysts are highlighting the potential buying opportunities within this space. Morningstar chief US marketing strategist Dave Sekera has given a positive stance on value investing in 2024. Here are some comments from the analysts:\n\n\u201cWe see much better long-term investment opportunities within the value category and think investors should consider paring those growth stocks that have become overvalued and overextended. Now may be a good time to begin allocating to those contrarian plays that have underperformed, are unloved, and, most importantly, are undervalued.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Franklin Templeton have also expressed optimism regarding the performance of value stocks this year. Despite a period where value lagged behind growth on a global scale, the firm predicts a promising outlook ahead due to favorable global stock valuations, indicating potential for positive long-term returns. Moreover, the firm anticipates increased investment in value-oriented sectors and segments of the market, driven by ongoing consumer spending and recent government initiatives. The normalization of monetary policy is also expected to enhance the appeal of interest rate-sensitive and dividend-paying sectors to investors.\n\nAs we mentioned above, value stocks are often recognized for their dividends. Moreover, these equities offer higher dividend yields and have strong fundamental ratios when compared with growth stocks. Dividend growth is one of the most important factors when it comes to dividend investing. In this regard, The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index is used as a benchmark for dividend-focused strategies. The index seeks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. In 30 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts, we referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices which revealed that investment strategies aimed at generating income often show value characteristics. Stocks that offer high dividend yields and trade at lower prices often grab investors\u2019 attention. We also revealed that the dividend aristocrat index possesses a combination a combination of both growth and value attributes, rather than exhibiting a strong preference for one style over the other. A detailed analysis of the index from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown, indicating an average exposure of 59.04% to value stocks and 40.94% to growth stocks during this time period.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are some of the best dividend stocks that are also traded low compared to their intrinsic value.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed the most recent trading day at $447.90, moving -1.18% from the previous trading session. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.11%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.23%.\n\nShares of the aerospace and defense company have appreciated by 4.92% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Aerospace sector's gain of 2.55% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.5%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Lockheed Martin in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on April 23, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.86, indicating an 8.86% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $16.04 billion, indicating a 6.02% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $26.13 per share and a revenue of $69.42 billion, signifying shifts of -6.07% and +2.74%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.48.\n\nWe can additionally observe that LMT currently boasts a PEG ratio of 4.13. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

        "title": "Will Lockheed (LMT) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Lockheed Martin (LMT). This company, which is in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nThis aerospace and defense company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.23%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Lockheed came out with earnings of $7.90 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 per share, representing a surprise of 8.82%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $6.66 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.77 per share, delivering a surprise of 1.65%.\n\nFor Lockheed, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nLockheed currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.31%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 23, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation\u2019s LMT business unit, Aeronautics, recently clinched a contract for its F-16 aircraft program. The award has been provided by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $33.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Feb 28, 2025. Per the terms of this deal, Lockheed will provide engineering and technical services, support and sustainment, configuration management and programmatic support for the F-16 Weapon System. These efforts will ensure system integrity, mission readiness, sustainability, reliability, and maintainability of the F-16 Weapon System.\r\n\r\nThe work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX. This contract includes foreign military sales to Bahrain, Belgium, Chile, Bulgaria, Denmark, Portugal, Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nAs nations across the globe strengthen their defense structures, spending on military arms and ammunition that boast technologically advanced features continues to increase manifold. This also includes increased investments in fighter aircraft and its associated weapon systems.\r\n\r\nWith increasing investments in combat jets and associated upgrades, the growth opportunities for the combat aircraft market remain solid. To this end, per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.72% during 2024-2029.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed Martin, a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.\u00a0 Apart from the F-16, the company\u2019s extensive product portfolio includes the F-35 Lightning II, C-130 Hercules, F-22 Raptor and many more.\r\n\r\nIn particular, LMT\u2019s F-16 Fighting Falcon, a combat-proven multi-role fighter jet, enjoys a solid presence in the combat aircraft market. Evidently, more than 3,100 F-16s are operational in 25 countries, with around 19.5 million flight hours.\r\n\r\nImpressively, the current backlog of the F-16 Block 70 program includes 133 aircraft for six countries. Looking further ahead, Lockheed expects a demand for up to 300 additional F-16 jets globally. This reflects heightened demand for associated F-16 weapon systems as well, which should usher in more contract wins for Lockheed, like the latest one, in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nA few other defense players that can gain from the expanding fighter aircraft market are Textron TXT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC. \r\n\r\nTextron\u2019s unit Textron Aviation is engaged in the production of fighter aircraft like the Beechcraft T-6 training aircraft and the Beechcraft AT-6 light-attack aircraft. The company also manufactures the Beechcraft Model 18 light bomber, the T-44 and T-34 training aircraft and the T-1A jet trainer.\r\n\r\nTXT boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 7% from that reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nBoeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment is engaged in the development, production and modification of a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more. In 2023, Boeing delivered 22 F/A-18s, nine F-15s, three T-7A Red Hawks and 11 P-8 models.\r\n\r\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 12% from that reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of fighter aircraft since its inception. It has built some of the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. The significant awards in 2023 won by NOC included $2.1 billion for F-35 programs, $1.7 billion for E-2 and $1.5 billion for Triton.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from that reported in 2023.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past month, shares of LMT have gained 4.8% compared with the industry\u2019s 2.8% rise.

        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 most elite US military special forces and their role. You can skip our detailed analysis on these formidable, well-trained units and head over directly to the 5 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role.\n\nAmerican special forces have captured the imagination of popular culture in the country for quite some time, and often bring to mind movies such as the Black Hawk Down, or video games like Call of Duty. There is immense prestige associated with these warrior units within the US military as well. These top-notched special forces are made up of some of the finest soldiers recruited from across the nation after a high level of rigorous training.\n\nSpecial forces have historically worked in small units and were called in only for critical missions. However, since the advent of the war against terrorism, their role has significantly expanded. The United States Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, has grown from 38,000 personnel since the September 11 attacks in 2001 to 73,000 by 2020, with their budget also skyrocketing 495% from $2.3 billion to $13.7 billion during the period.\n\nGiven the complex challenges these special forces undertake, the US is equipping its units with sophisticated equipment to dominate the battlefield and defy challenges that come in their way. Last year in July, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) \u2013 a project it had been working on for several decades \u2013 had achieved initial operational capability.\n\nTwo of the three DCSs have already been provided by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the military, which would enable the Navy SEALs to travel well below the surface of the ocean without wetsuits, as well as get in and out of the submersibles undetected while being entirely submerged. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a key industrial partner of US special operations forces, and is also the primary contractor for SOCOM\u2019s logistics and sustainment support program.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeabed capabilities of the American Navy are also being ramped up at a pace. As noted in a report in May 2023, the Navy has commissioned a next-generation attack submarine, for the Navy SEALs to perform covert operations along the floor of the ocean, such as retrieving parts of missiles and rockets tested underwater, and tapping deep sea communication cables. Work on the project is underway at General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD).\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) had also previously been providing professional services to American military special forces for their global operations. The company had signed a five-year, $900 million contract with SOCOM between 2016 and 2021, which included services like technical support, engineering for major weapon systems, and assisting the units with decision making related to production and program control. ARMA Global, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), executed work on the agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, SOCOM\u2019s fleet of MH-47G Chinook helicopters is also being upgraded, for which The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received a $271 million modification contract in December 2023. Under the agreement, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) will procure six MH-47G rotary wing renewal build aircraft for SOCOM. Work on the program is likely to be completed around mid-2027. Earlier last year, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also won a task order, valued at $18 million, for the acquisition of components and parts for the aircraft. 15 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role\n\nGetmilitaryphotos/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nMultiple sources were considered to develop consensus and rank the most elite US military special forces. These included Insider Monkey and Yahoo Finance\u2019s recent article, 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World, CBS News\u2019 list of The most elite U.S. special forces, Special Ops Magazine\u2019s 2022 List of Elite US Special Forces, Asymmetric Warfare Group\u2019s write-up titled The most elite special operations forces in the US, and Business Insider\u2019s piece on the most elite special forces units in the US.\n\nWe observed special forces units that received mention on these websites, and then ranked them based on their operational expertise and strategic importance.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 11 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now take a look at the most elite US military special forces and their role.\n\n15 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role:\n\n15. Special Operations Weather Technicians\n\nThe Special Operations Weather Technicians, abbreviated as SOWT, are meteorologists of the United States Air Force, with ground-combat training. These personnel are tasked with gathering intelligence from forward deployed locations related to weather and terrain, including oceans and rivers, in hostile territory, which assist in planning special-operation missions. The weather technicians are trained enough to accompany conventional military units in the battlefield as well. All special forces operations in the US are planned using the intelligence and coordination provided by the Special Operations Weather Technicians.\n\n14. Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen\n\nThe Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen of the Navy are one of the most elite US military special forces. These units have amphibious mission expertise, with personnel trained to operate in challenging operations around rivers and coastal areas. These forces typically take part in operations that are spearheaded by the Navy SEALs, and focus on special weapons and tactics, infiltration, and exfiltration during combat. The Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen notably served in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n13. Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST)\n\nNext on our list of the most elite US military special forces is the Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, abbreviated as FAST. The unit is part of the security force regiment of the Marine Corps, and is tasked with protecting sensitive naval installations, as well American diplomatic missions and embassies abroad. Other roles of the force include physical security, counter surveillance, and close quarter combat. This month, the United States Southern Command deployed the Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n\n12. Marine Raiders\n\nThe Marine Raiders are the combat units of the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), with its personnel trained in special reconnaissance, direct action, unconventional warfare, and foreign internal defense. The regiment comprises a headquarter company and three battalions, with each battalion then containing 4 Marine Special Operations Companies (MSOCs). The Marine Raiders were established during World War II to take part in amphibious warfare, and has since then being regarded among the top special forces in the United States.\n\n11. Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company (ANGLICO)\n\nNext up in the 11th spot is Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, or ANGLICO, which is the airborne fire support unit of the Marine Corps. These special forces are recognized for being the only full-time firepower control team under the Department of Defense that is capable of coordinating fire support from air, land, and sea. ANGLICO\u2019s personnel receive training in close air support, ground-based fire support, and are known for their prowess in cannon, rocket artillery, and precision-guided munitions. It is among the most elite US military special forces.\n\n10. Army Rangers\n\nThe 75th Ranger Regiment is an elite, airborne-qualified light infantry special forces unit under the command of the US Army, that support forces like Delta, and can also conduct raids on enemy targets themselves. It takes one year of training for new recruits to become an Army Ranger. Some of the courses and qualifications these personnel go through include combat diving, military freefall, parachuting, survival escape, and mountain warfare among others.\n\n9. Air Force Combat Control Team\n\nThe Air Force Combat Controllers are among the top special forces units in the United States. The unit holds expertise in stealth insertion behind enemy lines and often coordinates attacks by ground troops by providing them air support. Their personnel are skilled in air traffic control, fire support, command and control, and communications. It takes 2 years of rigorous training to join the combat control team, with between 90-95% of the initial applicants missing out due to self-eliminations, injuries, and academic failures. According to the Asymmetric Warfare Group, the Air Force Combat Control Team likely played a role in the Libyan Revolution against Gaddafi\u2019s regime.\n\n8. Air Force Pararescue\n\nThe USAF\u2019s Pararescuemen are highly-trained personnel who go well behind enemy lines and rescue lost men. Their role is different from the combat control team in the sense that their responsibility is to rescue, not offensive operations. Despite that, the pararescue force is well equipped and skilled to face enemy combatants on the ground through guerilla tactics and specialized small unit attacks. These pararescuemen experience rigorous training in parachuting, combat diving, basic survival, underwater missions, paramedic training, and specialized courses in pararescue recovery before joining the force.\n\n7. Green Berets\n\nThe Green Berets are the US Army Special Forces, comprising versatile troops with expertise in unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, direct action, counter-terrorism, and counter proliferation, among others. The Green Berets were among the first military units to enter Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, and have played an active role in several American military operations and wars over the years, including in Laos, Vietnam, El Salvador, Kuwait, and Iraq.\n\n6. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance\n\nNext up is Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance, a special operations force with the primary responsibility to gather intelligence required for the Marine Corps to conduct their missions. The unit also has a direct action role and has expertise in covert maritime infiltration. Some of the responsibilities of the Force Recon include scout swimming, coastline reconnaissance, maritime interdiction, and direct action where required. Their personnel are trained in parachuting, skiing, and amphibious techniques.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets 15 Countries that will have the Most Powerful Militaries by 2030 16 Strongest Navies in the World in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Secures $440M Contract for F-35 Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT recently secured a modification contract for its F-35 aircraft. The award has been given by Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $439.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2029. Per the terms of this deal, Lockheed will provide logistics and support with respect to the F-35A, F-35B and F-35C aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe agreement includes the provision of support equipment, pilot flight equipment and post-ejection survival training material, as well as associated administrative, contract management, planning and readiness reviews and non-recurring introduction to service support in support of site activation and initial sustainment activities.\r\n\r\nMajority of work related to this deal will be executed in Redondo Beach, CA. The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense participants and Foreign Military Sales customers.\n\nSignificance of F-35 Jets\n\nLockheed\u2019s F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter jet in the world. It has the ability to securely connect high-tech platforms to share information across every domain, air, land, sea, space and cyber. The aircraft comes in three main variants - F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing), F-35B (short take-off and vertical landing) and F-35C (carrier-based).\r\n\r\nSuch remarkable features of this fighter jet are likely ushering in solid contract wins for LMT, like the latest one. Consequently, the F-35 program remains a major revenue contributor for the United States\u2019 largest defense contractor.\r\n\r\nEvidently, the F-35 program was the largest revenue generator for Lockheed\u2019s Aeronautics business unit, accounting for 64% of the segment\u2019s net sales in 2023 and 26% of LMT\u2019s total consolidated net sales. Lockheed has delivered 992 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 373 jets in the backlog as of Dec 31, 2023. \r\n\r\nLMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets in 2024 and 156 in 2025 and beyond. This, along with the latest contract win, reflects the solid demand that the F-35 program enjoys in the combat jet market.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAmid the geopolitical tensions prevalent across the globe, nations are rapidly augmenting their defense spending to procure more fighter jets. This, in turn, has been bolstering the prospects of the military aviation industry. Per a report by the Expert Market Research firm, the global military aircraft market is estimated to record a CAGR of 5.10% during 2024-2032.\r\n\r\nSuch projections indicate immense growth opportunities for prominent combat jet manufacturers like Lockheed. The company\u2019s fighter jet portfolio includes C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor, in addition to F-35 jets. During 2023, around 40% of Lockheed\u2019s sales came from the Aeronautics segment, which manufactures these fighter jets.\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nA few other defense players that can gain from the expanding military aircraft market are Airbus SE EADSY, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC. \r\n\r\nAirbus\u2019 military aircraft consists of A400M, C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. In 2023, 61% of the Defence and Space segment\u2019s revenues came from military air systems. The company delivered a total of 1,783 military aircraft as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nEADSY boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 9.5% from that reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nBoeing\u2019s product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more. In 2023, Boeing delivered 22 F/A-18s, nine F-15s, three T-7A Red Hawks and 11 P-8 models.\r\n\r\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 13.1% from that reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman has built some of the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. The significant awards in 2023 won by NOC included $2.1 billion for F-35 programs, $1.7 billion for E-2 and $1.5 billion for Triton.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from that reported in 2023.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past three months, shares of LMT have gained 0.8% against the industry\u2019s 3.6% decline.

        "title": "Following a 1.0% decline over last year, recent gains may please Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) institutional owners",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Lockheed Martin implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 52% of the business is held by the top 8 shareholders Insiders have sold recently\n\nA look at the shareholders of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nLast week's US$3.9b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 1.0% losses.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Lockheed Martin.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Lockheed Martin does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lockheed Martin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lockheed Martin. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. Lockheed Martin Corporation, ESOP is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 9.2% of the company stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$72m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lockheed Martin. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin  you should know about.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Lockheed Martin (LMT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.88 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 16, 2024.\n\nLockheed Martin's Earnings ESP sits at 0.31%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.88 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.86.\n\nLMT is part of a big group of Aerospace stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at RTX (RTX) as well.\n\nRTX is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 23, 2024. RTX's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.24 a share 27 days from its next earnings release.\n\nFor RTX, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 is 0.65%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLMT and RTX's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "General Dynamics Corp.\u2019s GD business unit, Bath Iron Works, recently clinched a modification contract to provide integrated planning yard services for DDG 51 guided-missile destroyer ships. The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nValued at $44.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Bath, ME.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring General Dynamics?\n\nNations across the globe are fortifying their defense spending on military weapons and arsenals as they look to strengthen their defense capabilities. This also includes augmented spending on navy ships for enhanced sea warfare capabilities.\r\n\r\nSuch increased spending tends to benefit General Dynamics as its Bath Iron Works business unit excels in manufacturing navy ships and provides modernization and lifecycle support for the U.S. Navy.\n\nGeneral Dynamics\u2019 DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers witness significant demand owing to their wide range of advanced warfighting capabilities in multi-threat air, surface and subsurface environments. It also offers protection against a wide range of threats, including ballistic missiles. Its strong demand is evident from the fact that in 2023, the company won a contract from the Navy for the construction of three Flight III DDG-51 destroyers, with a total of 12 ships in backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032.\n\nSuch strong demand, in tandem with excellence in providing unique capabilities in shipbuilding, should continue to boost the company\u2019s order book in the long run. This is likely to enhance its revenue generation prospects.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nPer a report from Mordor Intelligence firm, the naval combat vessels market is projected to witness a CAGR of 13.3% during the 2024-2029 period.\n\nThis growth opportunity should boost General Dynamics\u2019 operating results as it is one of the prime contractors of navy ships. Notably, GD\u2019s Marine Systems segment is the leading designer and builder of surface combatant and auxiliary ships for the U.S. Navy. The segment also provides comprehensive post-delivery services to modernize and extend the service life of Navy ships.\r\n\r\nOther defense majors poised to benefit from the expanding naval combat vessels market are BAE Systems BAESY, Lockheed Martin LMT and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.\n\nStory continues\n\nBAE Systems designs, builds, commissions, repairs and supports a full range of complex naval ships, from offshore patrol vessels to aircraft carriers. Its Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers are the largest warships ever constructed in the United Kingdom.\n\nBAESY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems\u2019 2024 sales indicates growth of 34.1% from 2023 levels.\n\nLockheed manufactures Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). Its freedom-variant LCS, USS Nantucket (LCS 27), is a resilient, flexible warship designed to encounter the evolving missions of the U.S. Navy.\n\nLockheed\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of LMT\u2019s 2024 sales implies a growth rate of 2.7% from the 2023 figure.\n\nHuntington Ingalls\u2019 business segment designs and constructs non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, including amphibious assault ships, expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants and national security cutters.\n\nThe long-term earnings growth of Huntington is pegged at 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of HII\u2019s 2024 sales indicates a growth rate of 2% from a year ago.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of General Dynamics have increased 24% in the past year against the industry\u2019s 7.2% decline.

        "title": "NATO Spending by Country Per Capita: Top 15 Countries",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the NATO spending by country per capita and list the top 15 countries. You can skip our detailed analysis on the increase in defense expenditure by NATO\u2019s European members after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and head over directly to NATO Spending by Country Per Capita: Top 5 Countries.\n\nMoscow\u2019s assault on Ukraine in 2022 sent shockwaves across Europe, signaling the return of war to the continent after decades of peace. Finland and Sweden are the latest countries to join NATO following the start of the war, while several other countries across the region are actively racking up their military expenditure to bolster national defense.\n\nGlobal defense spending reached a record high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in 30 years, having spent $480 billion in military expenditure during the year. NATO\u2019s defense spending in 2022 was also 0.9% higher than in 2021, totaling $1.2 trillion. Final, aggregated figures for 2023 are still awaited, however, another recent report by SIPRI noted a 94% increase in arms imported by European countries between 2019-2023, compared to the previous five-year period from 2014-18. The United States was the origin of 55% of the arms procured by Europe in the last five years.\n\nThe surge in military expenditure amid growing calls from the United States and NATO for members of the treaty to meet the expectation of spending at least 2% of their GDP on defense has created a boom in the armaments and aerospace industries. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s full-year financial statements for 2023 reported a 2.4% increase in revenue compared to the previous year to total $67.6 billion. The company\u2019s net profit has also grown from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $6.9 billion in 2023.\n\nNATO members are actively pursuing measures to upgrade their fleet of fighter jets, by replacing aging aircraft with newer, advanced fighters \u2013 most notable of which is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-35. Last year, Canada announced it was buying 88 of these fifth-generation fighter jets to enhance Arctic security and also get closer to NATO\u2019s spending expectations. Earlier in December 2022, Berlin also clinched a $8 billion deal with the United States to procure 35 F-35 fighters, with the first set of planes set to be delivered in 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stock price has risen more than 9% since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. RiverPark Advisors made the following comment about the company in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\nLMT is the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense contractor. With about 70% of its $66 billion in revenue from the U.S. government, the company is well positioned to benefit from U.S. defense budget growth, historically 5%-6% per year, as well as increased global military spending. With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, a 2.9% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from more than $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns. We re-initiated a small position in August.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s figures are also soaring. The company generated revenues of $68.9 billion in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 3%, with contracts continuing to flow to the company from NATO countries seeking to enhance national security. This week, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a $1.2 billion contract to develop and supply Germany with Patriot air and missile defense systems.\n\nHungary also boosted its aerial security in November 2023 after it received delivery of the first two units of the NASAMS air defense system from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace. According to a report in Bloomberg, the American defense conglomerate is also in talks with French aerospace company Safran, with the latter showing interest in RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s flight control units.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) on the other hand generated $39.3 billion in sales in 2023, at a 7% increase in comparison to 2022. The company reported impressive growths in its aeronautics, defense, mission, and space systems. Projecting a sustained demand for its weapons in 2024, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has forecasted $41 billion in revenue for this year. Its share price has increased 16% since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe company, in June last year, modernized the air defense capabilities of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia under a $14.3 million fund provided by the US. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is also cooperating with Terma, a Danish company, on electronic warfare training in Northern Europe. NATO Spending by Country Per Capita: Top 15 Countries\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have listed the top 15 NATO countries in ascending order of their estimated military spending per capita in 2023. Data has been sourced from NATO\u2019s July 2023 press release titled Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2014-2023). In the case of two or more countries having the same expenditure per capita, we gave a higher ranking to the country that was spending a greater percentage of its GDP on defense.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 15 NATO Members with the Largest Militaries.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of NATO spending by country per capita.\n\nNATO Spending by Country Per Capita: Top 15 Countries:\n\n15. Italy\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $484\n\nItaly\u2019s GDP was estimated to be $2.19 trillion in 2023 by the IMF, with over $33 billion incurred on military expenditure, which was equivalent to 1.46% of its GDP. According to NATO, Italy\u2019s estimated per capita military spending for 2023 is $484.\n\n14. Belgium\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $502\n\nBelgium has the second lowest percentage of GDP spent on defense among all NATO members, measured at 1.13% last year. Despite that its military spending per capita is above $500. This figure is likely to rise as Brussels plans on increasing its military expenditure to 1.54% of the GDP by 2030.\n\n13. Estonia\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $578\n\nEstonia borders Russia to the East. The country\u2019s military spending has continuously (since 2015) been above NATO\u2019s 2% target for member states. Last year, Estonia allocated 2.73% of its GDP on defense expenditure \u2013 the fourth highest in NATO. The per capita military spending in Estonia has increased by nearly 75% over the last decade, from $328 in 2014 to $378 in 2023.\n\n12. Canada\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $622\n\nCanada boasts one of the most powerful militaries in the world. The country spent $28.9 billion on defense in 2023, which amounted to 1.38% of its GDP. In March this year, Canada announced $1.3 billion in defense spending cuts over the next three years, which is likely to reduce the country\u2019s military spending per capita.\n\n11. Greece\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $622\n\nGreece\u2019s defense spending soared from $5.2 billion in 2014 to $8.5 billion in 2022, before dropping slightly to $7.1 billion last year. Despite the dip, it has the third highest share of military spending as a share of the GDP (3.01%), and is among countries with the highest military spending per capita in NATO.\n\n10. Poland\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $657\n\nPoland had the highest percentage of military spending as a share of the GDP (3.9%) in 2023 among NATO members. This is a significant jump from 2.42% in 2022. As a result, since 2022, the country\u2019s military spending per capita has more than doubled from $325 in 2020 to $657 now.\n\n9. Germany\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $677\n\nGermany is on ninth spot in our list of NATO spending by country per capita. However, the country has consistently remained under target as far as NATO\u2019s 2% spending goal is considered. Last year, it only spent 1.57% of the GDP on defense. In February, the government pledged to meet NATO\u2019s goal by next decade, and stated that its defense spending could rise up to 3.5% of the GDP by then.\n\n8. France\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $737\n\nFrance boasts one of Europe's strongest and largest militaries, and spent 1.9% of its GDP on defense expenditure in 2023. Last January, French president Emmanuel Macron announced to raise the country\u2019s military budget by 40% for 2024-2030 to enable the French military to be combat ready, amid the volatile situation in Ukraine. This move is likely to increase the country\u2019s military spending per capita, which has grown by a meager 5% since 2019 ($700).\n\n7. Luxembourg\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $773\n\nLuxembourg has the lowest contribution of military spending as a share of the GDP in NATO (0.72%), but it is among countries with the highest spending per capita in the alliance. One factor for that is its tiny population of 640,000. Having said that, the country deserves credit that despite its small size, it has more than doubled its defense spending from $250 million in 2015 to an estimated $609 million in 2023, with its per capita military spending increasing 76% in this time period.\n\n6. Netherlands\n\nMilitary Spending Per Capita: $848\n\nThe Netherlands is in sixth position in the list of NATO spending by country per capita, with $848 being spent per head in the country on defense expenditure. In 2023, the Dutch government is estimated to have spent 1.7% of its GDP on military expenditure. With its economy crossing the $1 trillion mark, Amsterdam can look to further increase military spending to meet NATO\u2019s 2% goal.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the NATO Spending by Country Per Capita: Top 5 Countries.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nNATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries 15 Countries that Provided the Highest Military Aid to Ukraine 20 Countries With Highest Military Spending In The World\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 countries that have the most F-16 fighter jets, and take a detailed look at one of the most recognizable and capable fourth-generation fighter jets in the world. You can skip our analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets.\n\nThe F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-seat, single-engine fighter jet that was initially developed as a lighter and cheaper equivalent of the F-15, but has grown into being among the most widely used fighter jets in the world. More than 4,600 units of the aircraft have been produced to date, with production still ongoing. As older versions of the jet retire, newer and upgraded F-16s take center stage.\n\nOriginally built by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for the United States and its allies with the first order placed in 1972, the F-16 entered service with the US Air Force in 1978. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) continued to manufacture the fighter jet until it sold its aircraft manufacturing business to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in 1993. More than 25 countries operate the F-16 today, with more joining, making it the most widely operated fighter jet in the world, currently.\n\nEarlier in January this year, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) delivered Slovakia the first two of its total 14 F-16 Block 70 fighters ordered in 2018 for $1.8 billion. The country retired its aging fleet of 11 MiG-29s two years ago, and is replacing them with the F-16. The Block 70/72 is the latest version of the fighter aircraft, and is operated by only six countries, with Slovakia becoming the first European nation to operate the variant. The remaining deliveries are scheduled by 2025.\n\nTurkiye is also set to receive the Block-70 F-16s. The country\u2019s deadlock with the United States over the purchase of these fighter jets ended in February, more than two years after Ankara made the request for the F-16s. Ties between the two countries had strained after Washington expelled Turkiye from the F-35 program following the latter\u2019s procurement of a missile defense system from Russia in 2017. The US agreed to the sale of the F-16 only after Ankara approved Sweden\u2019s NATO membership bid. The deal is valued at $23 billion. Turkiye\u2019s history with the fourth-generation fighter goes way back to 1983, when it entered into a $4 billion deal with General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for 160 F-16 fighters.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a report in the New York Times, Ukraine is also likely to deploy six of the 45 F-16s promised by its European allies by July this year. Kyiv is currently in the process of training its pilots, who by the end of 2023, had progressed from taking foundational flight skills in the United Kingdom, to advanced instructions in Denmark related to the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Ukraine will receive new jets built by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), as well as the older F-16s being phased out by European countries to replace them with the F-35 fifth-generation fighter. 15 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have ranked countries that have the most F-16 fighter jets in ascending order of their fleet size. Data has been sourced from FlightGlobal\u2019s 2024 World Air Forces directory. Moreover, we have also shed light on the newer F-16 jets ordered by these countries, as well as the upgradation investments on their current fleet.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 15 Most Expensive Fighter Jets in the World.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of countries that have the most F-16 fighter jets.\n\nTop 15 Countries with Most F-16 Fighter Jets:\n\n15. Chile\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 46\n\nChile has a fleet of 46 F-16 fighter jets of A/B/C/D variants. 35 of these are currently in operation of the Chilean Air Force, while 11 are training aircraft according to FlightGlobal. In October last year, the Pentagon announced that a $177 million contract had been signed with Chile, under which Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) would upgrade its operated F-16 aircraft to the M6.6 standard.\n\n14. Poland\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 48\n\nPoland is heavily investing to enhance its aerial military capabilities. Apart from placing an order for 32 F-35 fifth-generation fighter jets, the country entered into a $389 million deal with the United States in September 2023 to modernize its F-16 fleet. Under the agreement, its 48 F-16 fighters will be provided electronic warfare (EW) database reprogramming support, among other equipment and support.\n\n13. Thailand\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 50\n\nNext on our list of countries with the most F-16 fighter jets is Thailand, which has a fleet of 50 F-16 fighter jets, of which 36 are operated by the air force for combat use, while 14 are used as training aircraft. According to a report in Janes, Bangkok plans to decommission its fleet of F-16A/B fighter jets by 2028.\n\n12. Belgium\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 53\n\nBelgium has a sizable fleet of F-16 fighter jets, comprising 53 aircraft. This is the main combat aircraft in operation of the Belgian Air Component. Belgium operates A and B variants of the jet. The country has 34 F-35 fifth generation fighter jets on order, which will likely replace its aging fleet of the F-16s. Last year in October, Belgium announced to provide an undisclosed number of F-16s to Ukraine, starting 2025.\n\n11. Jordan\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 59\n\nJordan is among countries that have the most F-16 fighter jets, with a fleet size of 59, of which 43 are F-16A variants, while the other 18 are F-16B Fighting Falcons. It is among the most powerful countries in the Middle East, and a key strategic ally of the United States, which provides the country substantial financial and military assistance. In June 2022, Jordan placed an order for 12 Block 70 F-16 fighters with Lockheed Martin.\n\n10. Singapore\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 60\n\nThe Republic of Singapore Air Force has 100 combat jets, which include 60 F-16s and 40 F-15 fighters. The country also has 12 F-35 jets on order according to FlightGlobal. Last year in September, Singapore upgraded its fleet of F-16s with new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, and the capabilities to deploy sophisticated air-to-air missiles such as the Rafael Python-5 missile. According to the country\u2019s Ministry of Defense, the upgrade has increased the operational service of the fleet to the mid 2030s.\n\n9. Pakistan\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 75\n\nMuch like the country\u2019s nuclear weapons, the F-16 fighter jets are a symbol of military strength in Pakistan, with images of the jet being adorned on billboards on national days and on commercial trucks that move along the nation\u2019s highways. It is a weapon which provides Pakistan a perceived edge over its arch rival India in aerial conflicts, as was seen in the dogfight between the two countries in the Kashmir region in 2019. 44 of these jets are used as combat aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force, while 31 are currently training aircraft. In 2022, the Biden administration approved a $450m fleet sustainment sale for Pakistan\u2019s F-16 jets, aimed at enhancing their air-to-ground capabilities.\n\n8. United Arab Emirates\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 76\n\nThe United Arab Emirates procured 80 F-16 fighter jets from the United States, as part of a $6.4 billion deal signed in 1998, of which 76 currently remain in operation according to FlightGlobal. These aircraft have significantly contributed to the UAE\u2019s aerial power in the region, with the Emiratis continuing to spend heavily on upgrading and maintaining these jets. In 2017, the UAE Defense Ministry announced that it had agreed a $1.6 billion contract with Lockheed Martin for the upgradation of its F-16 fleet.\n\n7. Taiwan\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 137\n\nTaiwan is one of the countries that have the most F-16 fighter jets, with a fleet size of 137 aircraft \u2013 nearly twice the size of the UAE, which preceded it in the rankings. Taipei, right since independence, has focused on raising a strong military due to the perceived threat of a Chinese invasion. Taiwan is on track to quickly be among the largest operators of the F-16 jets in Asia, as it awaits the delivery of 66 new F-16V Block 70 fighter jets from the United States.\n\n6. Greece\n\nF-16 Fighter Jets: 154\n\nGreece is in sixth spot, with a fleet of 154 active F-16 fighter jets, of which 115 are used as combat aircraft by the Hellenic Air Force, while 39 are used for training purposes. Last year in August, Athens announced that it would take part in the training program to train Ukrainian pilots in flying the F-16s. Greece has the most number of F-16 fighter jets in Europe.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Countries with Most Bombers and Superior Air Force 20 Largest Air Forces in the World Heading into 2024 15 Countries with the Most Attack Helicopters in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Bell-Boeing, a joint venture between The Boeing Company BA and Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. TXT, recently secured a contract involving the V-22 Osprey aircraft. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, has awarded the deal.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $19.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by May 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Bell-Boeing will provide recurring and non-recurring engineering for completing software upgrades to support the V-22 aircraft program.\n\nThe majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Ridley Park, PA, and Fort Worth, TX. The contract will serve the government of Japan.\n\nGrowing Jet Demand & V-22 Jets\n\nA rapid increase in terror attacks across the globe has compelled nations to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. With the United States being the largest exporter of defense equipment across the world, the country witnesses a steady flow of contracts for its combat-proven weaponry from both Pentagon and its foreign allies. With military jets and helicopters constituting a major portion of a nation\u2019s armaments, prominent jet manufacturers in the United States, like Textron and Boeing, frequently witness notable contract wins for their combat-proven aircraft.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Bell-Boeing\u2019s primary product, V-22 Osprey, is a family of multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. V-22 Osprey is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.\n\nConsidering these features of the aforementioned family of tiltrotors and the growing demand for military aircraft, V-22 enjoys solid demand in the military jet market across the globe. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAmid geopolitical tensions like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, nations are rapidly augmenting their defense spending to procure more fighter jets. This, in turn, has been bolstering the prospects of the military aviation industry. Per a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global military aviation market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.23% in the 2024-2030 period. This will surely benefit major U.S. combat aircraft manufacturers like Textron, Boeing, Lockheed Martin LMT and Northrop Grumman NOC, with North America dominating this market space.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed is one of the pioneers in the combat aircraft space, with its product portfolio constituting some of the most advanced military aircraft like F-35, C-130, F-16, F-22 and a few more. Of these, F-35 is the company\u2019s largest program.\n\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nOn the other hand, Northrop is a renowned manufacturer of autonomous and manned aircraft like MQ-4C Triton and Global Hawk. These jets are used for battle management, strike and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement & Zacks Rank\n\nTextron\u2019s shares have risen 38.3% in the past year against the industry\u2019s 8.3% decline. Boeing\u2019s shares have lost 8.3% in the past year.

        "title": "15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 states with the most federal workers in the US. We have also discussed the job satisfaction levels of the federal workers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US.\n\nIn the United States, only 15% of the 2.19 million civilian full-time federal employees are situated in the Washington metro area, while the remaining 85% are dispersed across the country. According to data from the Office of Personnel Management as of March 2023, federal workers earn an average annual salary of nearly $100,000. However, with the looming possibility of a government shutdown, federal employees face the prospect of halted paychecks and temporary work suspensions until the shutdown concludes, a scenario reminiscent of the 34-day shutdown in December 2018.\n\nDespite the concentration of federal workers in the Washington area, comprising only 9% of the local workforce, other regions, particularly those near military installations, exhibit a higher proportion of government employees. For instance, federal civilian workers represent 17% of the workforce near the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Southern Maryland. It is worth noting that the state government sector with the largest number of employees in the United States is typically the education sector, specifically public K-12 schools and universities. Moreover, Huntsville, Alabama is one of the cities with the most federal workers in the US.\n\nIn 2023, job satisfaction among US employees reached an unprecedented high, with 62% expressing contentment in their roles. According to the 2023 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, federal employees surpassed this average, with 68% reporting satisfaction, coupled with a notable rise in engagement to 72%, matching 2020's five-year peak. Kiran Ahuja, director of the US Office of Personnel Management, emphasized the resilience and increasing engagement of federal workers, highlighting their commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA). However, challenges persist, notably in addressing poor performance, as 41% of respondents noted ineffective workers lingering without improvement, suggesting areas for organizational development.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently released data showcasing the compensation discrepancies between state and local government workers and their private industry counterparts. According to the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) report, state and local government workers receive significantly higher total compensation, with an hourly rate of $60.56 compared to $43.11 for private industry employees. This disparity extends to both salaries and benefits, with government workers earning $37.53 in wages compared to $30.33 in the private sector, and receiving benefits worth $23.03 versus $12.77, respectively.\n\nThe figures indicate that state and local government workers enjoy compensation rates approximately 40.5% higher than those in the private industry. This disparity is particularly notable in benefits, where government workers receive 80.3% more than their private sector counterparts. Despite these attractive compensation packages, there are concerns regarding the sustainability of such benefits, especially considering the financial strains faced by some local governments.\n\nTwo of the most relevant companies for the federal workers in the US are Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH). Let\u2019s see what they have to offer the federal workers.\n\nLockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) is another important aerospace and defense company that specializes in advanced technology systems, including aircraft, missiles, and cybersecurity solutions. Its products are extensively used by federal agencies such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and intelligence agencies.\n\nWith approximately 70% of its revenue coming from government contracts,Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) is one of the largest suppliers to federal agencies. However, tensions arise as government officials advocate for a shift towards fixed-price contracts, viewing cost-plus contracts unfavorably.\n\nAt 30,000 feet, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT)\u00a0 financial performance appears strong, with its space segment showing promising growth fueled by US investments in missile defense. Yet, challenges persist, notably in joint ventures like United Launch Alliance, where profitability remains elusive amidst ambitious projects like the Vulcan rocket. Moreover,\u00a0 Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s foray into service-based pricing with its subsidiary Crescent confirms its shift towards adapting to evolving government procurement trends, signaling the company's willingness to explore alternative approaches.\n\nOn the other hand, UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurance company in the world by net premiums written, provides health benefit programs for federal employees. With over 1.5 million medical providers and 7,000 hospitals and care facilities across the country, UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) ensures broad access to healthcare services for federal workers.Moreover, UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH)\u2019s health insurance plans offer competitive benefits, including preventive and treatment services with excellent National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) ratings. The average deductible for a silver plan, often chosen by federal employees, stands at $3,619 per year, lower than many competitors. Despite slightly higher premiums compared to some rivals,UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) \u2018s plans deliver high-quality coverage, as evidenced by its favorable complaint ratio and AM Best financial strength rating of A+ (Superior).\n\nIn essence, federal workers benefit from UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH)\u2019s extensive provider network, affordable deductibles, and superior quality ratings, making it an ideal choice for their healthcare needs. 15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US\n\nAn accountant in a suit entering the Federal Reserve with an arm full of U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the states with the most federal workers in the US, we relied on the data from the Congressional Research Service Report of 2023. Please note that uniformed military personnel and federal contractors are excluded. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Colorado\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 38,089\n\nAs one of the states with most federal employees, federal workers play a pertinent role in different sectors. Excluding certain agencies, such as the CIA and NSA, the US Office of Personnel Management indicates approximately 10,500 employees within the USPS alone. Denver, with its prominent Denver Federal Center hosting 28 agencies including the National Ice Core Lab, has the highest concentration of federal workers. Federal employment constitutes roughly 2% of Colorado's total workforce.\n\n14. Alabama\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 39,264\n\nA recent efficiency study on Alabama's state government identified multiple issues. Outdated methods and duplicated services plague over 150 executive branch entities. There are recommendations to merge historical authorities, requiring electronic payments, and consolidating workforce development boards.\n\n13. Oklahoma\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 40,461\n\nIn Oklahoma, a recent report revealed stark disparities in pay between state and private-sector employees. Among the 18,784 state workers surveyed, 57% were found to be underpaid compared to their counterparts in private businesses. Notably, the Oklahoma Tax Commission has initiated salary increases for its employees, aiming to bring their pay within 10% of private-sector levels\n\n12. Illinois\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 42,637\n\nAFSCME is Illinois' largest government-worker union that seeks $3 billion for salaries and benefits. Yet, Illinois state workers are the country\u2019s highest-paid workers and already receive generous compensation. AFSCME's demands include raises of 29% over four years, a 37.5-hour work week, five weeks of vacation, and enhanced health care.\n\nWith 42,637 federal civilian employees, it is one of the best states for government jobs in USA.\n\n11. North Carolina\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 47,960\n\nThe State Employees Association of North Carolina (SEANC) is advocating for a 5% pay increase for state workers over the next two years. The Senate budget has proposed a 2.5% raise, while the House offered 4.25%. SEANC also requested a $5,000 retention bonus and a 2% cost of living adjustment for retirees. With 23.4% of state government jobs vacant and a 37% turnover rate, recruiting and retaining staff have become critical for the state.\n\n10. New York\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 51,716\n\nIn New York State, full-time local government employees outside New York City decreased by almost 8% over 15 years, dropping from 491,102 to 452,298 between 2007 and 2022. Nevertheless, New York still has also one of the highest percentage of government employees by state.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 52,583\n\nOhio's state government has embraced skill-based hiring. This pioneering approach enhances job seekers' prospects, recognizing diverse skill sets beyond academic degrees. State job postings now prominently feature primary skills, alongside technical and professional proficiencies, reflecting the demands of 21st-century roles. To read more about such roles, see the Highest Paying Jobs That Don\u2019t Require a Degree or Experience.\n\n8. Washington\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 54,526\n\nWashington, D.C.'s mayor is strongly advocating for the return of federal employees to offices, paralleling her push for city workers to resume office attendance four days a week, focusing on community engagement, collaboration, and support for local businesses. However, this directive is facing resistance from some city employees who prefer remote work for its community interaction and question the emphasis on office presence over productivity.\n\n7. Pennsylvania\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 63,560\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a pilot program will deploy OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Enterprise service to assist state workers in administrative tasks. Initially involving an unspecified number of Office of Administration employees, the program aims to gather feedback to potentially expand access to another 100 licenses. Led by Neil Weaver, secretary of Pennsylvania\u2019s Office of Administration, the initiative seeks to maximize the impact of generative AI tools.\n\n6. Georgia\n\nFederal Civilian Employment: 77,034\n\nIn anticipation of another partial government shutdown, over 3.5 million federal employees and military personnel prepare for potential furloughs and pay freezes, including 77,000 civilian federal workers in Georgia. The looming shutdown, stemming from House Republicans' struggle to produce a short-term funding plan, could disrupt the livelihoods of millions, with some essential workers like military personnel and TSA officers continuing to work without pay.\n\nClick here to see the 5 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 States Most Dependent on the Federal Government 17 Highest Paying Government Jobs Without a Degree 15 Best Ex-Cop Jobs for Former Police Officers\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Boeing (BA) Wins $1.14B Deal for F/A-18 &amp; EA-18G Programs",
        "content": "The Boeing Company BA recently secured a modification contract for its F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $1.14 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by April 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will be engaged in the production and delivery of 10 F/A-18F aircraft, as well as two F/A-18F and five F/A-18E aircraft. Boeing will also provide a technical data package, including the operation, maintenance, installation and training data to support F/A-18 and EA-18G sustainment efforts for the U.S. Navy.\r\n\r\nThe majority of work related to this deal will be performed at Hazelwood, MO and El Segundo, CA.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Boeing?\n\nAs nations across the globe continue to strengthen their defense structures, spending on military arms and ammunition that boast technologically advanced features continues to increase manifold. This also includes increased investments in military aircraft that play a critical role in air warfare missions.\r\n\r\nBoeing, a global leader in the development, production, maintenance and enhancement of manned and unmanned aircraft, stands to benefit from such increased demand.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that Boeing\u2019s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet, the backbone of the U.S. Navy, is a highly capable, affordable and available tactical aircraft. The EA-18G Growler, a variant of the F/A-18F, provides tactical jamming and electronic protection to the military around the world. In 2023, Boeing successfully delivered 22 F/A-18 models, from which one can gauge the solid demand that these jets enjoy in the combat aircraft market.\r\n\r\nThe latest contract win is another testament to that. Such contract wins tend to boost the company\u2019s operating results from the Boeing Defense, Space & Security segment, which ended 2023 with a backlog of $59.01 billion.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAmid geopolitical tensions like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, nations are rapidly augmenting their defense spending to procure more fighter jets. This, in turn, has been bolstering the prospects of the military aviation industry. Per a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global military aviation market size is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.23% in the 2024-2030 period.\r\n\r\nSuch projections indicate immense opportunities for Boeing to reap the benefits of military aviation market expansion. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nSome other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft that are expected to gain from the military aviation market\u2019s growth opportunities are Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Airbus Group EADSY.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman has built some of the world\u2019s most advanced combat aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. The segment witnessed a higher volume of restricted programs as well as the Triton and E-2 programs in 2023.\r\n\r\nNorthrop boasts a long-term (three-to five-years) earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed is one of the pioneers in the combat aircraft space, with its product portfolio constituting some of the most advanced military aircraft like the F-35, C-130, F-16, F-22 and a few more. On Jan 29, 2024, the Czech Republic government signed an agreement to procure 24 5th Generation F-35 Lightning II aircraft.\r\n\r\nLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nAirbus Group\u2019s military aircraft consists of the A400M, the C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. The company delivered a total of 1,783 military aircraft as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nAirbus\u2019 long-term earnings growth rate is 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies growth of 9.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of BA have lost 11.5% compared with the industry\u2019s 9.3% decline.

        "title": "PPA: This Defense ETF Is Outperforming Its Peers",
        "content": "The Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:PPA) has outperformed its peers over the past three, five, and 10 years. Defense stocks have historically been a good place to invest, and I\u2019m bullish on PPA as a good way to gain exposure to them, thanks to its outperformance versus peers, its diversified approach to investing in aerospace and defense, and the fact that it gives investors a bit of different exposure to the space versus its peers.\n\nWhat Is the PPA ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nAccording to fund sponsor Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), PPA is \u201cbased on the SPADE Defense Index. The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. The Index is designed to identify a group of companies involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of US defense, homeland security and aerospace operations. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly.\u201d\n\nThe fund launched in 2005 and has $2.9 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nWhy Invest in Defense Stocks?\n\nDefense stocks are generally a good sector for investors to gain exposure to, as defense companies have strong relationships with large and stable customers, like the U.S. government and other national governments. Because of these strong, longstanding relationships and the considerable technical expertise and financial resources required to manufacture products like fighter jets, missiles, drones, and other complex military-grade equipment, these companies enjoy strong moats around their businesses.\n\nFurthermore, defense spending is often uncorrelated with the broader economy, giving investors some downside protection.\n\nA Diversified Aerospace and Defense Portfolio\n\nPPA offers investors solid diversification within the aerospace and defense sector. It holds 53 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 50.7% of assets.\n\nThis makes PPA wider-reaching than peers like the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:XAR) and the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (BATS:ITA), which own 34 and 38 stocks, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find an overview of PPA\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nPPA owns all of the typical defense industry stalwarts that you would expect it to, like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC).\n\nBut what differentiates it a bit is that it also owns stocks that you might not immediately think of as aerospace and defense stocks, like General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON). While these stocks are indeed involved in aerospace and defense, they are giant industrial conglomerates with irons in the fires of many other industries as well. And while these stocks play a prominent role in PPA\u2019s SPADE Defense Index, they are absent from the underlying indices of XAR and ITA.\n\nAs you can see, General Electric is PPA\u2019s largest holding, with a weighting of 7.5%. And this far-reaching approach to aerospace and defense has been a good thing for the fund, as shares of General Electric have quietly gained 87.5% over the past year, driving a strong performance for PPA, as we\u2019ll discuss further below. Honeywell\u2019s performance hasn\u2019t been quite as spectacular as General Electric\u2019s, but it has still gained a decent 9.5% over the past year.\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is another interesting example of a stock that PPA owns, but XAR and ITA do not. While certainly not a traditional defense company, Palantir\u2019s software and data solutions are utilized by the U.S. military, the Department of Defense, and other defense agencies around the world.\n\nI like the fact that PPA gives investors exposure to the next generation of defense stocks like this. To be clear, Palantir isn\u2019t a top holding, as it is just a small position within the fund, but Palantir has a lot of potential, and shares have gained 198.1% over the past year.\n\nAnother thing that I really like about PPA is that it has much less exposure to the beleaguered Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock than competitors like ITA. While Boeing is a top 10 holding for PPA, its 4.1% weighting within the fund makes it a much more manageable position than ITA\u2019s 14.0% weighting in the troubled aerospace giant.\n\nBest-in-Class Performance\n\nPPA has generated an excellent annualized return of 14.2% over the past three years and excellent annualized returns of 11.4% and 12.7% over the past five and 10 years, respectively.\n\nThese are pretty solid results on their own, and these results are more notable in that PPA has decisively outperformed its peers like XAR and ITA recently.\n\nFor example, XAR has returned 5.4% over the past three years, 8.2% over the past five years, and 11.3% over the past 10. Meanwhile, ITA has returned 11.2% over the past three years, 5.3% over the past five years, and 10.1% over the past decade.\n\nAs you can see, PPA outperformed both of these peers over each time frame, especially over the past three and five years.\n\nWhat Is PPA\u2019s Expense Ratio?\n\nPPA has an expense ratio of 0.58%, meaning that an investor putting $10,000 into PPA will pay $58 in fees annually. Interestingly, this is right in line with the average expense ratio for all index ETFs, which stands at 0.57%, but it\u2019s also more expensive than that of peers like XAR and ITA, which charge 0.35% and 0.40%, respectively.\n\nThe fact that PPA is more expensive than its two closest competitors is the primary downside here. However, the fact that it has soundly outperformed these competitors over the past three and five years means that it can make a case that this higher fee is justified. If it keeps outperforming, most investors probably won\u2019t mind.\n\nDoes PPA Pay a Dividend?\n\nPPA is a dividend payer. While its yield of 0.6% certainly isn\u2019t the main draw here, it is an added bonus for investors. The fund has consistently paid dividends since its inception in 2005.\n\nIs PPA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, PPA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys, 11 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average PPA stock price target of $107.49 implies 8.6% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Good Way to Invest in Aerospace and Defense Stocks\n\nI\u2019m bullish on PPA going forward, given its strong performance over both the short and long term and the fact that it has outperformed its competition. PPA is a bit wider-reaching and a bit more diversified than its peers, and it gives investors exposure to aerospace and defense stocks that its peers do not, such as General Electric, Honeywell, and Palantir. The defense industry looks like a good sector for investors to gain exposure to, and PPA is a good way to do it.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "The Boeing Company (BA) recently secured a contract involving its KC-135 refueling tanker aircraft. The award has been offered by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Oklahoma City, OK.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $32.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Sep 30, 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will deliver KC-135 ruddevator booms.\n\nWork related to this deal will be carried out in Missouri and Canada.\n\nKC-135 Significance\n\nBoeing\u2019s KC-135 Stratotanker is an aerial refueling aircraft that provides core aerial refueling capability for the U.S. Air Force and has excelled in this role for more than 60 years. It also provides aerial refueling support to the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and allied nation aircraft.\n\nThe KC-135 is also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations. Over the years, the KC-135 has been altered to do other jobs ranging from flying command post missions to reconnaissance.\n\nThe fact that two of its variants, KC-135R and KC-135T aircraft, continue to undergo life-cycle upgrades to expand their capabilities and improve reliability indicates the strong demand that this particular product line of Boeing has been enjoying over time. This must have been boosting the order flow for Boeing involving KC-135, like the latest one. Such order flows are projected to bolster BA\u2019s top line in coming days.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nWith growing security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market for some time now.\n\nIt is imperative to mention in this context that military aircraft, both manned and unmanned, form an integral constituent of a country\u2019s defense products. Consequently, the refueling aircraft market has been booming lately with the rapid launch of manned and unmanned aerial systems, driven by increasing demand for combat aircraft and military spending of various countries.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that per a report published by the Global Market Insights firm, the global refueling aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2% during 2024-2032, with North America constituting a major portion of this market. Such projections boost growth prospects for Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States.\n\nImpressively, KC-135 apart, Boeing builds KC-46 Pegasus air refueling tanker jet. Notably, KC-46A is the only multi-mission tanker that\u2019s produced in America for the U.S. Air Force and its allies.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nAerospace stocks, other than Boeing, which are expected to gain from the growth of the refueling aircraft market have been discussed below.\n\nAirbus EADSY: Its A330 MRTT has become the world\u2019s first tanker to be certified for automatic air-to-air refueling (A3R) boom operations in daylight, following a successful campaign in collaboration with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). With 76 total aircraft sales as of August 2023, the A330 MRTT has been ordered by Australia (as launch customer), France, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Spain and Canada.\n\nAirbus boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EADSY\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 9.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nLockheed Martin LMT: Its LMXT is America\u2019s next strategic tanker aircraft. Offering a proven airframe with distinct U.S. Air Force-only capabilities, LMXT provides the most advanced and complementary tanker to meet America\u2019s immediate and long-term mission requirements.\n\nLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Its X-47B is a tailless, strike fighter-sized unmanned aircraft that can perform standard missions like aerial refueling. In April 2015, the X-47B once again made aviation history by successfully conducting the first-ever Autonomous Aerial Refueling (AAR) of an unmanned aircraft.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nShares of Boeing have lost 12.2% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 9.7% decline.

        "content": "Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. KTOS recently announced that its Unmanned Systems division has secured a modification contract involving its BQM-177A aerial target drones.

Such orders should boost the company\u2019s revenue generation prospects.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nDue to the significant interest of the military in UAVs and the growing focus on increasing spending on this segment, we may expect the UAV market to be on an impressive growth trajectory. In this context, per the report from Expert Market Research firm, the global UAV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.5% during 2024-2032.\r\n\r\nThis reflects expanding market opportunities for companies like KTOS that enjoy a well-established position in the UAV market. Other defense majors that may benefit from the expanding UAV market are as follows:\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: The company has a vast portfolio of autonomous systems, including Indago 4, MORFIUS, Stalker Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) etc. LMT\u2019s business unit Sikorsky\u2019s MATRIX technology is an aircraft autonomy system that will one day enable helicopters to resupply forward forces on the future battlefield without any human pilots or crew on board.\r\n\r\nLMT boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies an improvement of 2.4% from the prior-year figure.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC:\u00a0 It is a leader in autonomous systems and offers an impressive portfolio of UAVs, which include Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, Fire Scout, Bat unmanned aircraft system etc. In November 2023, Australia\u2019s multi-intelligence MQ-4C Triton completed its first flight. Australia has placed an order for four such UAS. During 2023, NOC secured $1.5 billion as awards for Triton.\r\n\r\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from a year ago.\r\n\r\nBAE Systems BAESY: Its PHASA-35, an ultra-lightweight, solar-electric High Altitude Pseudo Satellite UAS, completed its successful flight trial in June 2023. It offers an alternative and flexible approach to conventional systems, such as satellites or conventionally powered aircraft, for the provision of persistent and cost-effective imagery and communications. Taranis and DEMON are also UAVs produced by BAESY.\r\n\r\nBAESY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales implies an improvement of 34.1% from the year-ago figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of KTOS have rallied 32.6% compared with the industry\u2019s 31.1% growth.

        "title": "Forget Boeing, Buy This Magnificent Defense and Aerospace Stock Instead",
        "content": "Lately, it feels like there's a new story about problems with a Boeing aircraft every week. Boeing is one of only a few companies that build commercial jets, so it's hard to see the company vanishing. It could be too big to fail. However, that doesn't mean you should buy the stock. There's no telling how deep Boeing's problems run.\n\nInstead, consider a proven winner like Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT). It's a more diversified defense and aerospace company than Boeing, poised to deliver solid long-term investment returns.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nLockheed Martin is a diverse but pivotal industry presence\n\nAviation is a significant component of Lockheed Martin's business, but the company is diversified across air, land, sea, and space. Lockheed Martin designs and manufactures complex weapons systems, vehicles, and technologies for the U.S. government and its allies. Some of Lockheed Martin's famous programs include the F-35 fighter jet, Black Hawk helicopters, the Javelin weapon system, Air Warfare Destroyer ships, and more.\n\nThe company's trailing 12-month revenue is $67 billion, and Lockheed Martin ended 2023 with a record-high $160.6 billion order backlog. Unfortunately for the world, the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, including in Gaza and Ukraine, only increase the likely demand for defense and weapons products like what Lockheed Martin builds.\n\nLockheed Martin has existed since the early 1900s, and that's generations of relationship building with the U.S. government, the best customer a company could hope to have. It's doubtful that Lockheed Martin is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nThe company returns cash to shareholders\n\nImportantly, Lockheed Martin is profitable enough to share its profits with investors. It repurchases its shares to help boost earnings-per-share growth and pays dividends that management has raised for 22 consecutive years.\n\nThis dramatically boosts investment returns over time. For example, a $10,000 investment in Lockheed Martin 20 years ago would be worth $99,000 today on price appreciation alone. Add in the dividends, and that investment balloons to over $173,000:\n\nStory continues LMT Chart\n\nThe share repurchases add up too. The outstanding share count has declined by nearly 24% over the past decade alone.\n\nFortunately, Lockheed Martin seems poised to continue this successful recipe for returns. The dividend payout ratio is 49% of cash flow, leaving roughly $3 billion in cash flow after paying the dividend that management can repurchase shares with. Lockheed Martin is also leveraged to just 1.6 times its EBITDA, so the balance sheet is in great shape and doesn't need to be immediately addressed. That means more cash for investors.\n\nCould Lockheed Martin fly past long-term expectations?\n\nThe biggest drawback to Lockheed Martin today is the company's struggle to grow revenue. Sales have stagnated over the past few years, and there is a lot of political pressure to keep federal spending under control. LMT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nFortunately, management is guiding 2024 revenue between $68.5B and $70B, so Lockheed Martin looks ready to resume revenue growth. However, analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by just mid-single digits annually over the coming years.\n\nThese estimates could prove conservative. For starters, America's defense budget continues to grow. According to Statista, experts believe it will grow from around $850 billion to over $1 trillion over the next decade. There is also the uncertainty of U.S. politics. Elections could change the outlook for defense and aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin.\n\nInvestors should note that management is guiding for a slight earnings decline in 2024, but the long-term trend seems to be upward. It's just a matter of how fast earnings will grow.\n\nStill, it's hard to go wrong here if you're a long-term investor looking for a slow and steady wealth-creating stock you can buy and sleep well at night.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

Besides this condition, the three other formal requirements for a company to be included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index are the following:\n\nBeing a member of the S&P 500 Index Maintaining a float-adjusted market cap of at least $3 billion Maintaining $5 million in daily share trading value for three months before acceptance.\n\nLockheed Martin easily meets these three criteria. Thus, with a track record of 21 consecutive years of dividend increases already in place, assuming the company maintains its current trajectory, Lockheed Martin is poised to fulfill the final condition for inclusion in the esteemed Dividend Aristocrats Index in approximately the next four years.\n\nWhy Is Becoming a Dividend Aristocrat Important for LMT Stock?\n\nBecoming a Dividend Aristocrat isn\u2019t just about status. A company\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index comes with several benefits, so it\u2019s a relatively big deal.\n\nFor starters, yes, status is one of the benefits that will benefit Lockheed Martin stock upon future inclusion in the Index. Currently, only 68 companies boast the Dividend Aristocrat title. Precisely because this group of companies is so elite, its constituents tend to hold a strong standing within the investment community.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors appreciate the proven ability of the management teams in these companies to reward them with growing dividends over prolonged periods, including during recessions and challenging market climates. In turn, this leads to Dividend Aristocrat stocks featuring below-average volatility. Evidently, the Dividend Aristocrats Index ETF (BATS:NOBL) currently features a beta of 0.75, lower than the core S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 beta, which is, by definition, 1.00.\n\nAnother benefit of being a Dividend Aristocrat is that a stock\u2019s valuation can achieve above-average levels as investors are willing to pay a premium for high-quality names. Thus, while future investors may have to slightly overpay for Lockheed Martin, assuming this premise takes place, investors securing exposure to the stock in advance could end up benefiting from additional gains just from this factor alone.\n\nFinally, I believe that Lockheed Martin could enjoy lower borrowing costs upon inclusion in the index due to its debtors will be reminded of the company\u2019s credibility and overall ability to produce growing profits. Given that Lockheed utilizes debt rather heavily due to the CapEx-heavy nature of its business, evidenced by its current net debt position of $17.2 billion, a reduction in borrowing costs could have a significant effect on improving its profitability.\n\nDividend Growth Has Decelerated, But Its Future Growth Prospects Remain Strong\n\nOne potential concern that investors might have regarding Lockheed\u2019s journey to becoming a Dividend Aristocrat could be the fact that its dividend growth has decelerated in recent years. Particularly, the rate of Lockheed\u2019s past five dividend increases is as follows:\n\n2019 dividend increase: 9.1% 2020 dividend increase: 8.3% 2021 dividend increase: 7.7% 2022 dividend increase: 7.1% 2023 dividend increase: 5.0%\n\nDespite the declining pace of dividend growth, I don\u2019t think that this should be a concern for investors. I believe that this is a temporary trend formed by management essentially preparing for the possibility of a rising rate environment in advance, which ultimately ensued. Thus, I see the dividend growth deceleration as a prudent move and not a lack of earnings capacity to pursue stronger increases. After all, Lockheed\u2019s EPS has grown by a much stronger five-year CAGR of 9.4% over the same period.\n\nIn fact, EPS reached a new record in FY2023, growing by 27.2% to $27.65. This figure implies a healthy payout ratio of 46% against the $12.60 in dividends paid during this period. Therefore, the company has plenty of room to keep growing its dividends and even re-accelerate the pace of dividend increases. In the meantime, the stock\u2019s 2.9% yield is sizable enough to result in meaningful payouts.\n\nIs LMT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLooking at Wall Street\u2019s view on the stock, Lockheed Martin bears a Hold consensus rating based on three Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. At $477.57, the\u00a0average Lockheed Martin price target suggests 10.2% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell LMT stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Charles Minervino of Susquehanna, with an average return of 10.12% per rating and a 69% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nIn wrapping up, I think it\u2019s clear that Lockheed Martin is on track to join the prestigious club of Dividend Aristocrats. The company\u2019s extended track record of consistent dividend increases means that it shouldn\u2019t be more than four years before this event takes place. For investors, this potential inclusion in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index means that the stock\u2019s investment case might inherently improve further, thus providing an incentive to hop on board sooner rather than later.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 most powerful militaries in Latin America and where they get their defense equipment from. You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America.\n\nWhile final figures for 2023 are still awaited, global military expenditure reached a record-high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). $961 billion of the total amount was incurred in the Americas, 94% of which was contributed by the United States and Canada.\n\nIn Latin America \u2013 the region comprising parts of North, South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean Islands where Romance languages are predominantly spoken \u2013 defense expenditure was measured at $57.2 billion in 2022, at a modest increase of 0.8% compared to 2021.\n\nBrazil had the largest share of this expenditure, with over $20 billion spent on military expenses in 2022. The country has been leveraging its economic strength for quite some time now to upgrade its military. In 2014, Brasilia placed an order for 36 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden to enhance its aerial capabilities, for a deal valued at $5.04 billion. Four more jets were added to the contract in 2022. Six of these fighters have been received so far from Sweden, with the remaining set for delivery by 2027. A year earlier, the Brazilian Air Force provided a contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s subsidiary, Sikorsky, to provide logistics support for Brazil\u2019s 16 UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters for a period of four years.\n\nArgentina has also been investing heavily to strengthen its military. In June last year, the country ordered six Bell 407GXi helicopters from Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) to perform in critical search and rescue operations in the country\u2019s mountainous terrains. Later in October, the United States approved the transfer of 24 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) F-16 fighter jets from Denmark to Argentina. According to Argentine newspaper La Nacion, these jets will be equipped with air-to-air missiles and paid for with a $40 million financing package.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe approval by Washington to provide Argentina with the F-16s is being seen by analysts as a move to counter Chinese influence in South America. Buenos Aires has been restricted from procuring western military hardware since the Falklands War with the UK in 1982. The Argentines had initially been considering replacing their Dassault Mirage III fighters, which retired back in 2015, with the JF-17 \u2013 a joint production of China and Pakistan.\n\nIn a similar manner, Colombia has been offered by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to upgrade and modernize its fleet of fighter jets with the F-16s to counter competing offers made by France\u2019s Dassault Aviation and Swedish company Saab AB. The offer is reportedly backed by officials in Washington. Colombia is the fourth largest spender on defense in Latin America, having incurred over $9.9 billion on defense expenditure in 2022. The South American nation, in separate proposals, has also been offered to buy AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) for $225 million, and Harpoon anti-ship missiles from The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for $177 million. 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered various metrics to rank the most powerful militaries in Latin America. These include the size of their economy measured in terms of nominal GDP, countries\u2019 defense spending, technological capabilities, number of active military personnel, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, military aircraft fleet, and total naval assets.\n\nIt was observed where countries ranked on each metric, and then accordingly, they were assigned scores. For instance, if a country ranked first on any given metric out of 25, it received a score of 1 (25/25), and if it ranked fifth, it got a score of 0.84 (21/25), and so on. Finally their individual scores for each metric were summed to get an overall score. The 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America are listed in this article in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nData has been sourced from the 25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024, 20 Countries With Highest Military Spending In The World,20 Largest Armed Forces in the World Ranked by Active Military Personnel, 15 Countries with the Most Battle Tanks in the World, 15 Militaries with the Most Armored Fighting Vehicles in the World, Global Firepower Index 2024 and Global Innovation Index 2023.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the ongoing developments in the naval industry and head over directly to the 5 Strongest Navies in the World in 2024.\n\nNavies continue to remain a vital pillar of national defense in their standout role as the guardians of a nation\u2019s maritime interests by serving as a shield against threats emanating from the oceans. The increase in conflicts and disputes over international waters have further enhanced the significance of this branch of military, with governments allocating hefty budgets on procuring warships and arming existing vessels.\n\nUS Navy Projects\n\nAccording to a recent report in USNI News, the Department of Navy in the United States has sought a budget of $257.6 billion for 2025, and is seeking to buy six battle force ships which would include an attack submarine, two destroyers, one frigate, an amphibious transport dock, and a medium landing ship.\n\nThe US is also currently working on developing its upcoming nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine, the Columbia-class, which is projected to enter service in 2031. The project started in 2020, and is being spearheaded by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) as the primary contractor for the program. The new ballistic missile submarines will replace the US Navy\u2019s aging Ohio-class submarines.\n\nOn the other hand, the nuclear-powered Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers are being built by the Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) to replace the Nimitz class design. These ships will be an improved version of their predecessors, and would allow for greater aircraft deployment in the carriers, reduce the number of sailors, and provide higher electrical power for ship systems. The 50-year operating and support costs are also expected to drop $4 billion per ship.\n\nIt is expected that the Gerald R. Ford class program would have at least four aircraft carriers \u2013 CVN-78, CVN-79, CVN-80, and CVN-81. The CVN-78 was procured for a whopping $13.3 billion in 2008 and became operational in 2021. It was first deployed for operational stress tests in the Atlantic in late 2022, and successfully completed more than 1,250 aircraft flights. The CVN-79 was procured for $12.7 billion in 2013, and is scheduled for delivery in 2025. It will be capable of deploying Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-35C fighter jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nMajor Companies in the Naval Industry\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is one of the major contributors of the American Navy\u2019s strength, and has been designing warships for the military since 1960. It is also the maker of the Virginia-class and Seawolf-class of submarines operated by the US Navy. Last year in April, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was awarded a $847 million contract to repair and modernize the US Navy\u2019s fleet of aircraft carriers.\n\nAnother key player in the industry is Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), which is the largest shipbuilding company in the United States. The company generated a record-high revenue of $11.5 billion in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 7.3%. This included a $3.3 billion order by the US Navy to build five DDG-51 destroyers over the next decade. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) ranks 13th among the Top 20 Defense Contractors in 2024.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), despite being known for its aerospace expertise, has over the years played an active role in enhancing the naval strength of the United States by featuring in sea-based tests of aircraft carriers. The company is currently providing fleet support for the deployment of its Trident strategic weapon system in the Columbia-class submarine program as well. In October last year, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was awarded a $23 million contract by the Navy for software integration and engineering of its Integrated Combat System. 16 Strongest Navies in the World in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFive weighted metrics have been considered to rank the strongest navies in the world. These are aircraft carriers (40%), destroyers (25%), submarines (20%), corvettes (10%) and total naval assets (5%). We observed where all countries ranked in strength on each metric and then assigned them weighted ranking scores. Scores for each metric were then aggregated to get an overall score. The strongest navies in the world are listed in ascending order of these scores.\n\nData has been sourced from Yahoo Finance and Insider Monkey articles 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World and 12 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers, as well as the 2024 Military Strength Rankings of Global Firepower Index.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the most powerful navies in the world in 2024.\n\nTop 16 Most Powerful Navies in the World:\n\n16. Australia\n\nNaval Assets: 43\n\nSubmarines: 6\n\nAircraft Carriers: None\n\nDestroyers: 3\n\nCorvettes: None\n\nScore: 0.34\n\nTensions between Australia and China in recent years over the formation of AUKUS, a trilateral security agreement between Australia, the UK, and the US, have brought Canberra\u2019s naval capabilities to the spotlight. The Australian Navy may be small in size, but includes six submarines, three destroyers, and about 13 patrol vessels. Its naval strength is set to be bolstered with the US Navy planning to sell its Virginia class of submarines to Australia under the AUKUS pact between 2032 and 2035.\n\n15. Taiwan\n\nNaval Assets: 93\n\nSubmarines: 4\n\nAircraft Carriers: None\n\nDestroyers: 4\n\nCorvettes: 2\n\nScore: 0.39\n\nTaiwan\u2019s government, right since independence, has focused on building a potent military to prepare itself for what it perceives as an existential threat from China. The country operates 93 naval vessels according to the Global Firepower Index, which include four submarines, four destroyers, two corvettes, 22 frigates, and 10 countermine warships, along with several amphibious assault vehicles and patrol vessels.\n\n14. Thailand\n\nNaval Assets: 293\n\nSubmarines: None\n\nAircraft Carriers: 1\n\nDestroyers: None\n\nCorvettes: 6\n\nScore: 0.43\n\nThe World Directory of Modern Military Warships (WDMMW) describes the Thai Navy as a surface force that is focused around regional and local defense, especially considering that it has no submarines and destroyers.

        "title": "Investors in Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) have seen favorable returns of 69% over the past five years",
        "content": "The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 48% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 6.5% in the last year.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, Lockheed Martin managed to grow its earnings per share at 10% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Lockheed Martin the TSR over the last 5 years was 69%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nStory continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Lockheed Martin had a tough year, with a total loss of 3.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 32%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Lockheed Martin .\n\nLockheed Martin is not the only stock insiders are buying.

        "content": "As China continues to ramp up its military spending, American aerospace company Lockheed Martin is focusing on advanced technology.\n\nFOX Business went inside Lockheed Martin's Marietta, Ga., plant, the home of the iconic C-130 \"Hercules.\"\n\nThe aircraft, which has spanned American military history with a wide range of capabilities since 1954, has had an impact on military aviation as well as an economic impact on Georgia from its production.\n\nOver the 70 years, Lockheed Martin has produced 2,700 of the \"Hercules\" or \"Herc,\" with nearly half remaining in service.\n\nNEWEST AIR FORCE STEALTH BOMBER, THE $750M B-21 RAIDER, TAKES FIRST\n\nLockheed Martin Director of Production Operations Kevin Maher spoke with Madison Alworth and shed light on the success of the aerospace company's workforce.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"When you're working, and the guy on your right or the lady on your left are operating that aircraft, it really brings a different sense of importance and criticality to the quality requirements on the aircraft,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Americans build things extremely well. I really do,\" he added.\n\nThe aerospace company is currently producing the C-130J \"Super Hercules\" model, of which more than 540 aircraft have been delivered to 22 countries, in eight variants with a wide range of capabilities tailored to specific missions. According to the manufacturer, the C-130J can carry up to 46,700 pounds, has a range of 2,160 nautical miles and reaches a maximum cruise speed of 365KTAS (knots true airspeed) or 420 mph.\n\nThe FOX Business reporter also pointed out the aircraft's ability to take off and land on short and rough runways.\n\n\"Let me put that in context for you. A commercial runway is roughly 10,000 feet. These guys just need hundreds of feet to land or take off. And they can do it in dirt, in a field, you name it.\"\n\nLockheed Martin Marietta V.P. and General Manager Rod McLean also weighed in on the uniqueness the \"Hercules\" provides with its many mission capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The way that [it] is built, to provide, to fly fast enough to refuel fighter jets and slow enough to refuel helicopters to be able to land on 3000-foot runways, is what makes this aircraft so unique.\"\n\nAlong with its aerial refueling capabilities, the C-130 provides a platform for missions such as tactical airlift, surveillance and even a gunship.\n\nThe iconic aircraft is not just the mainstay in the U.S. military but attracts interest from other countries across the world.\n\nMaher explained the process of selling the \"Hercules\" to foreign countries.\n\n\"To a large extent, that vetting is done by the State Department. We'll have some configurations that are approved in advance. We have the capability with some customers to do what we would call a direct commercial sale. It's really a commercial contract, but in most situations, it's a foreign military sale. So we'll sell to the U.S. customer, and they will sell, you know, to the foreign customer whichever configuration they choose.\"\n\nMaher also commented on the aircraft's longevity, telling Alworth that \"there's a number of these aircraft that were made in the early [19]60s that continue to operate even after all that time\".\n\n\"They've only gotten better since then,\" he added.\n\nHe touched on how Lockheed Martin manages to keep these aircraft up in the air while keeping them up to date with the changing times.\n\n\"Amazingly enough, we've got a very robust sustainment operation that makes sure that we're producing the parts and the capabilities and the evolution and what these aircraft can do over time to keep it relevant.\"\n\n\"Even though so much time has passed, it's still really the only aircraft that has the full capability to do what it continues to do,\" he added.\n\nOriginal article source:Inside Lockheed Martin\u2019s \u2018Hercules\u2019 plant where a crucial piece of American hardware is born",

        "content": "In this article, we look at 15 NATO members with the largest militaries. You can skip our detailed analysis on European countries racking up their defense in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and head over directly to the 5 NATO Members with the Largest Militaries.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves around the world, most notably in Europe, where war has returned to the continent after decades of peace. Several countries in the region have begun taking emergency measures to bolster their defense amid turmoil in the neighborhood. Finland and Sweden have joined NATO, Paris is considering increasing the size of the country\u2019s reserve military personnel, while Poland has vowed to recruit about 150,000 new troops over the next decade.\n\nDefense spending in Europe reached $480 billion in 2022 - a 30-year high. Military expenditure of NATO countries, inclusive of the United States and Canada \u2013 the two North American members \u2013 was also 0.9% higher than in 2021 to total $1.2 trillion. Final figures for 2023 are still awaited, but according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Europe\u2019s arms imports over the last five years (2019-2023) had grown 94% compared to 2014-2018. The United States is the origin of 55% of all arms imported by Europe between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine, coupled with growing calls from NATO and the United States urging member states to increase their military spending in order to meet NATO\u2019s target of members committing at least 2% of their GDP on defense has created a boom for armament manufacturers. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) posted a revenue of $67.6 billion in 2023, at an increase of 2.4% compared to the previous year. Its net earnings have also grown from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $6.9 billion in 2023.\n\nSeveral NATO members are bolstering their aerial capabilities by procuring advanced fighter jets, one of which is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s fifth-generation fighter, F-35. Canada last year announced to purchase 88 F-35s in its bid to meet NATO\u2019s spending expectations and enhance Arctic security. This was preceded in December 2022 by Germany clinching a $8 billion deal with the United States for the procurement of 35 F-35 fighters. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stock price has gained 9.4% since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nStory continues\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s revenue is also soaring. The company generated a whopping $68.9 billion figure last year \u2013 3% higher than in 2022. It had received orders worth over $3 billion tied with replenishing Kyiv as of October 2023, and has been lined up by numerous NATO members as well that are looking to enhance their national security. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) signed a $1 billion contract with Hungary in 2022 to supply its air defense missiles to the European country. It is also reportedly in talks with French aerospace manufacturer Safran over the latter buying its flight control units. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was recently listed as the third best aerospace and defense stock to invest in by Insider Monkey.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), seeing a sustained demand for its weapons, has projected around $41 billion in sales for 2024. In June last year, the company modernized the air defense capabilities of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania under a $14.3 million fund provided by the United States. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is also cooperating with Danish company, Terma, on providing electronic warfare training in Northern Europe. The company\u2019s share price has increased 16% since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.\n\nDave Keffer, the chief financial officer for Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), made the following remarks in the the company\u2019s Q4 2023 Earnings Call:\n\nOn the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we\u2019re seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. 15 NATO Members with the Largest Militaries\n\nPhoto by Joel Rivera-Camacho on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nWhile the size of a military has played a critical role throughout history, the evolution of technology has significantly altered the landscape of warfare forever. Therefore, to rank the 15 NATO members with the largest militaries, we have considered five metrics \u2013 active military personnel, aircraft, tanks, submarines, and strategic warships which include destroyers, frigates and corvettes.\n\nWe observed where countries ranked on each metric, and based on that, assigned them scores. For instance, there are 32 NATO members. If a country ranked 1st on active military personnel, it received a score of 1 (32/32); if it ranked third, it got a score of 0.94 (30/32), and so on.

        "title": "BAE Systems (BAESY) Wins $754M Contract for Armored Vehicles",
        "content": "BAE Systems Inc.\u2019s BAESY Land and Armaments business unit recently secured a modification contract for procuring Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPVs). The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.\n\nValued at $754 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Feb 28, 2027.\n\nWhat Favors BAE Systems?\n\nWith widespread geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing hostility in the Middle East, having cast a shadow of increased militant threats across the globe, nations are rapidly expanding their defense arsenal. Considering the fact that armored combat vehicles like AMPVs are the primary offensive weapons in land missions, demand for technologically advanced combat vehicles is also on the rise.\n\nIt is imperative to mention here that BAE Systems is a renowned designer and manufacturer of both tracked and amphibious combat vehicles. Notably, in the United States, the company builds and upgrades a number of tracked combat vehicles, including the Bradley Fighting vehicles, M109 self-propelled howitzers and M88 recovery vehicles, in addition to AMPVs.\n\nNotably, the AMPV is a family of next-generation, highly survivable vehicles essential to the future of the U.S. Army and its allies. It is the U.S. Army\u2019s program to replace the Vietnam War-era and legacy M113 Family of Vehicles. The solid demand that AMPV enjoys in the U.S. combat vehicle space can be gauged from the fact that in August 2023, BAE Systems won an award worth $797 million for beginning the full-rate production of AMPV family of vehicles at a high and sustained rate. The latest contract win is another strong testament to that.\n\nDuring 2023, the company\u2019s Combat Mission Systems team in the United States expanded its operations at BAESY\u2019s York, PA, site. It did so to facilitate the full-rate production of AMPVs.\u00a0 Successful deliveries of the armored vehicles should boost BAESY\u2019s revenues in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nAs combat vehicles form an integral part of any military missions and arm them in their land warfare affairs, growth prospects for the global armored vehicle market remain solid with increasing defense spending worldwide.\n\nTo this end, the Morder Intelligence firm projects the global armored fighting vehicles market to register a CAGR of 5% during 2024-2029. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for BAE Systems, as it enjoys a lucrative position in the armored vehicle market.\n\nBAESY apart, other defense majors that are likely to reap the benefits of the expanding armored fighting vehicle market are Lockheed Martin LMT, RTX Corp. RTX and General Dynamics GD.\n\nLockheed\u2019s manufacturing facilities in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, is its Armored Vehicle Centre of Excellence where the company designs, develops and delivers turrets for the British Army\u2019s AJAX vehicles. LMT is currently engaged in the manufacture, integration and testing of 245 turrets at the Ampthill site. With increased demand for armored vehicles, the need for LMT-made turrets will also rise, thereby bolstering its future revenue growth.\n\nLockheed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 2.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nRTX, in collaboration with American Rheinmetall Vehicles, Textron Systems, L3Harris Technologies, Allison Transmission and Anduril Industries, is digitally designing America\u2019s next-generation infantry fighting vehicle named Lynx. The Lynx XM30 incorporates RTX\u2019s weapons, sensors, artificial intelligence and system integration expertise.\n\nRTX\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 10.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 5.7% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics\u2019 Land Systems business unit delivers powerful military vehicles, including the Abrams tank, Stryker combat vehicles, LAVs and AJAX armored fighting vehicles. In January 2024, the company announced that it has successfully completed the testing of its Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV), which has been designed to serve as the Marine Corps\u2019 \u201cquarterback\u201d on the mobile and multi-domain battlefield.\n\nGD\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 10.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GD\u2019s 2024 sales indicates a surge of 9.1% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of BAE Systems have rallied 49.1% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 32.7%.

        "content": "In this article, we look at the 20 largest armed forces in the world ranked by active military personnel. You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the defense industry and head over directly to the 5 Largest Armed Forces in the World Ranked by Active Military Personnel.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent shockwaves across the world. Most of all in Europe. With war returning to the continent after decades of peace, countries in the region are racking up their defenses amid the turmoil in their neighborhood. French officials are considering increasing the size of the country\u2019s reserve force, while the government in Poland has announced to recruit 150,000 additional troops over the next decade to take its number of active military personnel beyond the 300,000 mark. On the other hand, Sweden has decided to involve its society as a whole for national security, and formed a civil defense force.\n\nDefense expenditure is also on the rise in Europe, with the continent in 2022 witnessing its steepest rise in military spending in three decades. According to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), arms exports by European countries have grown 94% between 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. The United States was the origin of 55% of all arms imported by European countries in the last five years, which resulted in a 17% increase in its arms exports compared to 2014-2018.\n\nThe spike in military spending has meant a boom for the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $67.6 billion in revenue in 2023, which was 2.4% higher than the previous year. Its net profit also increased from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $6.9 billion in 2023. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stock price has risen 9.4% since the Ukraine war broke out two years ago. It is listed among Insider Monkey and Yahoo Finance\u2019s 15 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT): LMT is the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense contractor. With about 70% of its $66 billion in revenue from the U.S. government, the company is well positioned to benefit from U.S. defense budget growth, historically 5%-6% per year, as well as increased global military spending. With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, a 2.9% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from more than $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns. We re-initiated a small position in August.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) posted a whopping $68.9 billion in sales in 2023 \u2013 an increase of 3% compared to last year. The company had received orders tied with replenishing Ukraine worth $3 billion as of October 2023 \u2013 including a $624 million contract to build 1,300 stinger missiles for Kyiv. Several other European countries have also lined up RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) for their defense procurement. In 2022, Hungary placed a $1 billion order with the company to purchase its air defense missiles, and according to a report by Bloomberg in June 2023, French aerospace manufacturer Safran was in talks with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to buy one of its flight control units.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is another defense corporation that has significantly gained from the crisis in Europe. 2023 was the best financial year for the company in terms of revenue, registering a record high of $42.3 billion, which was 7.7% higher than in 2022.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s combat systems units\u2019 sales are also 25% higher in comparison to a year ago. The unit is responsible for manufacturing tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles. Its artillery output has already increased from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the sixth largest defense contractor in the world currently. You can read more on this in our article, Top 20 Defense Contractors in 2024.\n\nMoreover, expecting a sustained demand for its weapons, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has projected a revenue between $40.8 billion to $41.2 billion for 2024. Early last year, the company was awarded a $522 million contract by the US Army to manufacture artillery ammunition for Kyiv alongside Global Military Products (GMP). Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)\u2019s CFO, Dave Keffer, made the following remarks in the company\u2019s Q4 2023 Earnings Call:\n\nOn the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we\u2019re seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales.\n\nThe value of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)\u2019s stocks have surged by over 16% since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 20 Largest Armed Forces in the World Ranked by Active Military Personnel\n\nLEE SNIDER PHOTO IMAGES/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe largest armed forces in the world are ranked in ascending order of their number of active military personnel or manpower.

A key reason for that is its large number of military personnel who are battle-hardened due to Iran\u2019s active role in conflicts across the Middle East.\n\n7. Pakistan\n\nActive Military Personnel: 654,000\n\nPakistan has the seventh largest armed forces in the world. Due to strained relations and a history of wars with arch-rival India, and a troubled security climate along the border with Afghanistan, Islamabad has raised a strong and large military to tackle its national security challenges. The Pakistani army also lends support to its allies in the Arab world, and several thousand Pakistani troops are deployed in various GCC countries. Pakistan is the fifth biggest contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping missions as well.\n\n6. Ukraine\n\nActive Military Personnel: 900,000\n\nAll men aged between 18 and 60 are subject to conscription in Ukraine according to the new laws introduced by Kyiv after Russia\u2019s invasion of the country in February 2022. As a result, Ukraine has the sixth largest armed forces in the world currently with about 0.9 million active military personnel. Conscription has long been practiced in the country. It was abolished in 2013 briefly before being reinstated in 2014 after Moscow annexed Crimea. At that time, about 40% of the Ukrainian armed forces was made up of conscripts.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 20 most refugee-hosting countries in the world. If you want to skip our analysis, you can proceed to the section highlighting the 5 Most Refugee-Hosting Countries in the World.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, a refugee is defined as an individual who is unable to seek shelter in their country of origin and faces serious life threats based on factors such as race, religion, war, conflicts, disasters, affiliation with a particular social group, or political beliefs. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), global trends report published in June 2023, 52% of all refugees came from wars and conflicts in Syria, Ukraine, and Afghanistan.\n\nGlobal Defense Spending Reached $2.2 Trillion in 2023\n\nGlobal defense expenditures rose substantially last year, reaching an all-time high of over $2.2 trillion, according to a February 2024 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The sizable increase of nearly 9% was fueled by spending among NATO member states responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Ukraine, Russian equipment losses continue on a large scale. Analysts assess that its full-scale invasion has cost Russia more than 3,000 military battle tanks.\n\nThe Russian Invasion of Ukraine: 2024 Updates\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, forced 5.7 million Ukrainians to flee for their lives and cross into neighboring countries in search of shelter. Ukraine faces significant challenges in competing militarily with Russia, primarily due to a low defense budget that constrains Ukraine's ability to match Russia\u2019s might. On March 3, Reuters reported that Russia's military destroyed 47 Ukrainian drones in the southern region of Rostov oblast, which is a strategic center for Russian forces to conduct operations in Ukraine.\n\nWithout substantial assistance from allies in the West, Ukraine struggles with military resources and capabilities. Western partners have become critical for Ukraine's armed forces. On March 8, Reuters reported that Ukraine expects to receive $17.51 billion from the European Union within the next two months, with $4.92 billion scheduled in March and $1.64 billion in April 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing a meeting with the foreign ministers of France, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in Vilnius, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba appealed to the country\u2019s Western allies to supply arms of all kinds without restrictions. Kuleba also said,\n\n\u201cIf things continue as they currently happen, it\u2019s not going to end well for all of us, What is required is an unrestricted and timely supply of all types of weapons and ammunition to ensure that Ukraine beats Russia and the war in Europe does not spill over.\u201d\n\nOn March 8, Reuters reported that French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said that France is planning to have some of its arms manufacturers collaborate with Ukrainian companies to produce military equipment on Ukrainian soil to help the country in its war against Russia.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas Conflict\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups has been ongoing for several decades, however, escalation began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip. Following the expulsion of Hamas militants from Israeli territory, the Israeli military initiated extensive aerial bombardments of the Gaza Strip, and a large-scale ground invasion commenced on October 27, 2023. As of February, UNFPA reports that over 2.2 million people in Gaza are internally displaced. The health system is significantly affected, and hunger is widespread among the population.\n\nOn March 3, the Associated Press reported that the United States carried out emergency humanitarian airdrops in Gaza to alleviate the severe crisis. Thousands of meals were dropped by the U.S. military, aiming to provide essential supplies to residents. On March 9, The Guardian reported that Sweden and Canada decided to resume aid to UNRWA for Palestinians, with Sweden announcing an initial funding of $20 million.\n\nDemanding a ceasefire in Gaza, Houthi militants in Yemen attacked and seized various countries' merchant vessels in the Red Sea. In response, the United States on December 19,\u00a0 2023, announced a coalition of 10 countries to combat Houthis and protect trade in the Red Sea. On January 12, Al Jazeera reported that the United States and the United Kingdom, aided by Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, have conducted multiple cruise missile strikes and airstrikes targeting over 30 locations in Yemen.\n\nAn Analysis of Global Defense Spending in 2024\n\nThe United States Department of Defense proposed a budget of $842 billion for 2024, up from $816 billion from the previous year. The UK also allocated an additional $6.34 billion to the defense budget 2024/25 in response to escalating global threats, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. According to Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs report, more than 50% of the annual Department of Defense budget is spent on defense companies. Payments to contractors increased from around $140 billion in 2001 to approximately $370 billion in 2019, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.68%.\n\nAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global defense market has experienced rapid growth, rising from $575.33 billion in 2023 to $616.32 billion in 2024. It is anticipated to further expand to $772.49 billion in 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8%. This growth is fueled by governmental backing, military modernization initiatives, the adoption of lightweight materials, and increased usage of drones and military helicopters.\n\nAs ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Yemen, and Israel intensify, the demand for services and products of major defense companies continues to rise. Defense companies including Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) are supplying a wide range of equipment, weaponry, and technology to countries across the globe.\n\nDuring the financial year 2023, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) delivered a total of 124 aircraft and 69 helicopter programs. On March 1, contracts totaling over $1.09 billion were awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for missile systems, logistics support, and modifications. Given the uncertainty in Ukraine, European nations near Russia are purchasing F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), on January 29, Czechia signed a Letter of Acceptance (LOA) for the acquisition of 24 F-35 aircraft. Lockheed Martin delivered the initial four S-70 Black Hawks to Romania in November 2023 and plans to deliver eight more in the next four years. Additionally, in July 2023, Israel approved the purchase of another 25 F-35 jets worth $3 billion, as reported by Reuters, on July 2, 2023.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), previously known as Raytheon Technologies, is one of the world's largest defense companies. In January, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) secured contracts valued at $345 million from the U.S. Air Force and contracts of $154 million from the U.S. Army. On February 12, the U.S. Army awarded another $75 million contract for 600 radar-guided Coyote 2C interceptors. Recent contracts from the Pentagon, funded by Ukraine security assistance funds, allocated$192 million for delivery of Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles from RTX.\n\nBoeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the world's leading aerospace and defense corporations in the world. On January 31, Reuters reported that the company has supplied advanced ground-launched, GPS-guided bombs to Ukraine as part of the latest U.S. arms package. These new weapons, including the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB), aim to increase Ukraine's military capabilities with its 100-mile strike range. In February 2024, Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) secured significant contracts with the U.S. government, including a $405 million modification contract for the U.S. Air Force and a contract valued at $1.61 billion for providing guidance system support at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe refugee crisis has continued to escalate in both 2023 and 2024, as conflict, violence, and fear of persecution forced millions of people out of their homes. Wars and geopolitical conflicts have had a major role in global displacements and refugee crises over the ages.

        "content": "(Adds CEO quote in 3rd paragraph, details on test in 5th paragraph)\n\nBy Mike Stone\n\nWASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Castelion, a startup trying to build a hypersonic weapon for the Pentagon, tested its system for the first time, it told Reuters on Monday, as a growing group of small hypersonic arms makers challenge large defense contractors with less expensive, rapidly produced products.\n\nThe United States and China are engaged in an arms race to develop the most lethal hypersonic weapons, which travel in the upper atmosphere at more than five times the speed of sound and are designed to evade traditional defenses.\n\n\"This test flight, this first of many planned for this year, demonstrates our rapid development approach and is a major milestone for the company. We now have a low-cost hypersonic test platform ready to launch on demand,\" Bryon Hargis, Castelion's CEO and co-founder, told Reuters in a statement.\n\nU.S. companies like Castelion, RTX's Raytheon unit and Lockheed Martin are all working to develop the new class of weapon, which will translate to large contracts if production can be scaled.\n\nPrivate U.S. company Stratolaunch on Saturday said it had successfully completed the first powered flight of its Talon-A reusable hypersonic test vehicle.\n\nCastelion already has contracts with the U.S. Air Force and the Navy, the company told Reuters in a statement regarding the test, which did not include an explosive device, which it said took place on Saturday.\n\nBacked by $14.2 million in funding co-led by investors Andreessen Horowitz and Lavrock Ventures, the tiny startup has secretly conducted dozens of component tests since June 2023.\n\nThe company has set a goal of designing and building a complete weapons system that includes a hypersonic missile, a control station and a data link.\n\nSaturday's successful test of the missile system raises the stakes for rivals RTX and Lockheed Martin - Pentagon weapons contractors vying for billions of funds to build hypersonic weapons.\n\nChina and Russia both have competitive hypersonic weapons programs in what has become a geopolitical race to develop and field missiles that can change direction while traveling at several times the speed of sound.

        "content": "By Mike Stone\n\nWASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Castelion, a startup trying to build a hypersonic weapon for the Pentagon, told Reuters on Monday it tested its system for the first time, as a growing group of small hypersonic arms makers challenge large defense contractors with less expensive, rapidly produced products.\n\nThe United States and China are engaged in an arms race to develop the most lethal hypersonic weapons, which travel in the upper atmosphere at more than five times the speed of sound and are designed to evade traditional defenses.\n\nU.S. companies like Castelion, RTX's Raytheon unit and Lockheed Martin are all working to develop the new class of weapon, which will translate to large contracts if production can be scaled.\n\nPrivate U.S. company Stratolaunch on Saturday said it had successfully completed the first powered flight of its Talon-A reusable hypersonic test vehicle.\n\nCastelion already has contracts with the U.S. Air Force and the Navy, the company told Reuters in a statement regarding the test, which it said took place on Saturday.\n\nBacked by $14.2 million in funding co-led by investors Andreessen Horowitz and Lavrock Ventures, the tiny startup has secretly conducted dozens of component tests since June 2023.\n\nThe company has set a goal of designing and building a complete weapons system that includes a hypersonic missile, a control station and a data link.\n\nSaturday's successful test of the entire system raises the stakes for rivals RTX and Lockheed Martin - Pentagon weapons contractors vying for billions of funds to build hypersonic weapons.\n\nChina and Russia both have competitive hypersonic weapons programs in what has become a geopolitical race to develop and field missiles that can change direction while traveling at several times the speed of sound.

        "title": "Biden's meager 1% US defense budget increase buys fewer ships, jets",
        "content": "By Mike Stone\n\nWASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's overall U.S. defense and national security budget request expected on Monday will be just 1% higher than last year, forcing a slowdown in spending on a wide range of programs and delaying efforts to rebuild weapons stocks depleted by wars in Ukraine and Israel.\n\nThe $895 billion national security budget request, which includes funds for homeland security as well as nuclear weapons-related activities carried out by the Department of Energy, is the result of a two-year budget deal struck in mid-2023 that limited the budget to a 1% increase.\n\nUnder the cap, the Pentagon's share of the national defense budget was expected to be $850 billion. The $30 billion reduction to the Pentagon's funding will curb purchases of the stealthy F-35 jet made by Lockheed Martin and air defenses for Guam, and will delay programs, including slowing orders for an aircraft carrier made by Huntington Ingalls Industries and Virginia-class submarines made by Huntington and General Dynamics.\n\nThe Pentagon was expected to also trim costs by retiring older weaponry like ships and planes that are more expensive to operate.\n\nLast spring, before the cap was put in place, the Pentagon had estimated in 2025 it would need about $880 billion, and the total national security budget would be $929 billion. But because the budget increase is capped at 1% and smaller than expected, there will be less money to spend.\n\nThe cuts are not final given they will likely spark debate on Capitol Hill that could lead to an increase in the national defense budget to over $900 billion for fiscal 2025, budget watchers say.\n\nDefense spending accounts for about half of the U.S. discretionary budget; the other half goes to transportation, education, diplomacy and other departments. Entitlements like Social Security, the national retirement fund, constitute the nondiscretionary portion of the budget.\n\nThe 2024 budget, which includes $886 billion for national security, still has not passed Congress. The U.S. government is working under a continuing resolution: a stop-gap measure which caps spending at 2023 levels until a 2024 budget is passed. The current continuing resolution is keeping the government open until later in March.\n\nThe Pentagon order for Lockheed Martin's stealthy fighter will drop to below 70, down from an expected order of 83, for an estimated $1.6 billion drop in spending on the jets.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

        "title": "Is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) Trading At A 41% Discount?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Lockheed Martin is US$739 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$433 suggests Lockheed Martin is potentially 41% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 53% higher than Lockheed Martin's analyst price target of US$483\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Model\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.23b US$6.22b US$6.54b US$6.82b US$7.10b US$7.34b US$7.57b US$7.78b US$7.98b US$8.19b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x12 Analyst x12 Analyst x8 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 3.36% Est @ 3.04% Est @ 2.81% Est @ 2.66% Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0%  US$5.9k US$5.5k US$5.5k US$5.4k US$5.3k US$5.2k US$5.0k US$4.9k US$4.7k US$4.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$8.2b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.0%\u2013 2.3%) = US$226b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$226b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.0%)10= US$127b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$179b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$433, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.804. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "content": "In this article, we look at 11 countries with the highest number of military special forces in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on the most well-trained and formidable units of militaries with a key focus on American special forces\u2019 capabilities and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World.\n\nSpecial forces have captured the imagination of popular culture in the United States for quite some time, and often bring to mind video games like Call of Duty or movies such as the Black Hawk Down. There's considerable prestige associated within militaries with the warrior elite! These are top-notch units of the armed forces made up of the finest soldiers recruited from across the country to perform special operations. What sets these operators apart from the rest is their high level of rigorous training and strong personality traits including bravery and resilient mentality.\n\nWhile historically, special forces worked in small units and were only called in for critical missions, over time, their role has expanded throughout the world, especially because of the global war on terror. Special forces in the US for example under the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) grew from 38,000 personnel before the 2001 9/11 attacks to 73,000 by 2020, with their budget also seeing a 495% spike from $2.3 billion to $13.7 billion during this period.\n\nConsidering the complex challenges these forces undertake, the US military is equipping their special forces operators with sophisticated equipment to dominate the battlefield and overcome challenging scenarios that come in their way. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced in July 2023 that its Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) had achieved initial operational capability \u2013 a project it had been working on for decades.\n\nTwo DCSs have been provided to the Navy by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), with work ongoing on the third. According to the company, these submersibles will provide the Navy SEALs the ability to travel well below the surface of the ocean without wetsuits and get in and out of the vehicles undetected while being entirely submerged. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a key industrial partner of the American special forces, and also the primary contractor for SOCOM\u2019s logistics and sustainment support program.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US Navy is aggressively ramping up its seabed capabilities as well. According to a report, the Navy, with an eye on protecting assets deep in the ocean, has commissioned a next-generation attack submarine, work on which is already underway at the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD). The submarine will be used for the Navy SEALs to perform covert operations along the floor of the operation to tap deep sea communication cables and retrieve parts of missiles and rockets tested underwater.\n\nSOCOM is also upgrading its MH-47G Chinook fleet as part of the aircraft\u2019s modernization efforts. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in December 2023 received a $271 million modification contract, under which it will procure the MH-47G rotary wing renewal build aircraft for SOCOM. The company expects to complete work on the project, which would involve delivering six helicopters, by May 2027. Earlier that year in March, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) secured a $18 million task order for the acquisition of components and parts for the aircraft. MH-47G Chinook, first introduced in 1962 by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), continues to be widely used in American special operations despite aging.\n\nOn the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), between 2016 and 2021, under a five-year contract with a maximum ceiling of $900 million provided professional services to US special forces in their global operations. The services included technical and engineering work for major weapon systems, and assistance with decision-making related to production and program control. Work on the agreement was carried out by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s subsidiary, ARMA Global. 11 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World\n\nGetmilitaryphotos/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nSeveral credible publications and news reports available on the internet have been consolidated to identify countries with the highest number of military special forces in the world. Countries are sorted in ascending order of the number of special military forces they operate. Note that we have only considered the primary special forces in these countries. In case, where countries had the same number of military special forces, we outranked one over the other over our assessment of the capabilities of their special operations forces, which you can read about in our recent article, 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of countries that have the most military special forces in the world.\n\n11 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World:\n\n11. Germany\n\nSpecial Forces: 2\n\nKommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte (KSK) and Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte Marine (KSM) are the two prominent military special forces of Germany. The KSK is the elite special force of the German military or Bundeswehr. It is a large brigade-level unit that has expertise in search and rescue, commando warfare, and anti-terrorism. The KSK carried out multiple successful special operations in Afghanistan, and is considered one of the most well-equipped special forces in the world.\n\nThe Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte Marine (KSM) is the special forces group of the German Navy that is responsible for carrying out amphibious warfare. Both of these groups require their deployments to be authorized by the German parliament before they can undertake any operation.\n\n10. Spain\n\nSpecial Forces: 3\n\nNext up on our list of countries with the highest number of military special forces in the world is Spain, with three major special operations groups. We begin with the Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial, or the Special Naval Warfare Force, which is the special operations unit of the Spanish Navy. It mainly comprises the members of the Marines, and specializes in operations in land, sea, and air. The Unidad de Operaciones Especiales, which is regarded as one of the best special forces in the world, merged into the Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial in 2009, with the latter inheriting the former\u2019s reputation.\n\nMoving on now to Escuadr\u00f3n de Zapadores Paracaidistas (EZAPAC), which is the special forces unit of Spain\u2019s elite paratroopers, and works under the Spanish Air Force. Commandos joining the group go through rigorous training in parachuting, skiing, weapon handling, SATCOM transmission, survival, and other critical areas related to aerial special operations.\n\nLastly, commandos of the Caballero Legionario Maderal Oleaga or 19th Special Operations Group, are capable of maritime and mountain warfare, counter-terrorism, and sabotage.\n\n9. Pakistan\n\nSpecial Forces: 3\n\nPakistan\u2019s Special Services Group, or SSG, is among the best military special forces in the world. Due to the unique headgear worn by its commandos, it is also often referred to as the Black Storks. The SSG is a battle-hardened force that has undertaken several successful operations, especially in the restive tribal north against militant groups along the border with Afghanistan. The group has expertise in search and rescue, hostage rescue, psychological operations, direct action, reconnaissance, and taking out high-value targets.\n\nThe country\u2019s navy also has a special forces group with the same name \u2013 the Pakistan Navy Special Service Group, which is also often called the Navy SEALs and Navy SSG. This unit is capable of carrying out unconventional special operations at land, air and sea.\n\nOn the other hand, the Special Services Wing is the special operations branch of the Pakistan Air Force, whose personnel are trained to perform special missions related to reconnaissance, combat control, pararescue, offensive raiding, and direct action. These commandos are primarily responsible for air traffic control in hostile environments.\n\n8. France\n\nSpecial Forces: 3\n\nThe Commandement des Op\u00e9rations Sp\u00e9ciales, or the Special Operations Command (COS), in France is equivalent to the USSOCOM and UKSF, and oversees the operations of various special forces of the French military. The National Gendarmerie Intervention Group, or GIGN, is the most prominent special operations unit in France that is responsible for counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and the protection of VIPs in the country. According to a report in The Independent, the GIGN has freed up over 600 hostages since it was unveiled in 1973.\n\nAnother potent military special force is the Commandos Marine, which works under the French Navy. The personnel in this unit are trained to conduct special operations at sea, land, and air to defend France from internal and external threats. Intelligence gathering, underwater operations, counter-terrorism, and hostage rescue are areas of strength for the Commandos Marine.\n\nThe French Air and Space Force also has a special forces group in Air Parachute Commando No. 10, with expertise in reconnaissance, aerial guidance, counter-terrorism, and combat search and rescue.\n\n7. Canada\n\nSpecial Forces: 4\n\nThe Canadian Special Operations Forces Command is responsible for all special operations conducted by the country to respond to terrorism, as well as threats to Canada. There are four main special forces working under the command. The Joint Task Force 2 (JST2) is the most prominent military special force in the country, and is regarded among the best in the world, having worked on several counter-terrorism operations at home and abroad. The unit is known to collaborate with the US\u2019 Delta Force and UK\u2019s SAS in missions of common interests.\n\nThe second military special forces group in Canada is the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, which is the special forces unit of the country\u2019s armed force, and has expertise in undertaking direct raids, reconnaissance, and capturing strategic buildings.\n\nThe 427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron provides tactical aviation support to Canada\u2019s special forces command, while the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit works diligently to defend Canada from threats of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear nature.\n\n6. Russia\n\nSpecial Forces: 4\n\nRussia is among countries with the highest number of military special forces in the world. Its Alpha Group is one of the finest elite military units on the globe and specializes in counter-terrorism. It was founded in 1974 by the KGB, and currently operates under the FSB. The unit is believed to be operating under the direct control of Russia\u2019s top political leadership.\n\nAnother prominent group is Spetsnaz, which is the special forces unit of Russia\u2019s foreign military intelligence unit, GRU, and is known to operate in covert operations across the world. It has taken part in several operations overseas, including in Ukraine, Georgia, Syria, and Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe 45th Guards Independent Reconnaissance Regiment, one the other hand, is the special forces unit under the Russian Airborne Troops, whose primary responsibility is reconnaissance behind enemy lines, kinetic operations against command and control posts, and eliminating their leadership. Lastly, Vympel special forces are tasked with protecting strategic installations in Russia.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Militaries with the Most Armored Fighting Vehicles in the World 15 Countries with the Most Attack Helicopters in the World 10 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the hottest industries, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Space Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nMost of the debate surrounding the stock market this year has focused on artificial intelligence stocks, and rightly so when we look at the 12 month share price performance of key players in the industry such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one sector that has been the most turbulent this year has been space.\n\nSince there is only handful of pure play space companies with beefy share prices or sufficient liquidity, space stocks generally do not receive as much media coverage as other sectors such as consumer technology and oil and gas. This is further bolstered by the fact that aerospace exploration has primarily been a government funded venture for most of its history. The Space Race of the 1970s, which culminated with the end of the Apollo program saw the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pay private companies to develop complex industrial equipment like a launch vehicle (commonly known as a rocket) or shuttles.\n\nOver the course of time since the end of the Apollo program and the Space Shuttle era, space stocks started to make their first moves. While these days private companies can rightfully claim to operate some of the most technologically advanced vehicles in the world, back then space stocks were limited to satellite companies. In fact, while it's still a NASA contractor and a space stock because of its rockets and crewed spacecraft, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BO) is also one of the first space stocks to trade on the market. This is because the course of Boeing's long history has also seen the U.S. aerospace giant acquire the space division of the now RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) owned American defense contractor The Hughes Company. Hughes' Syncom satellite was the first geosynchronous communications satellite sent into orbit. There's another decades old space stock on our list and you can find it as you scroll through.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis year, one space stock has made the news on the market and as well as in general press coverage. This stock belongs to the Houston, Texas based aerospace and defense firm Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR). Intuitive Machines's Nova C Odysseus lunar lander launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket earlier in February 2024 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Before Odysseus, the privately held Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander had attempted to be the first U.S. Moon lander since the Apollo program, but the spacecraft failed soon after orbit.\n\nSo, hopes were high for Nova C, and since the lander is one of the few in the world that uses a methane powered rocket engine for its journey, it was slated to land on the Moon in just a week post launch. As the launch was successful and Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) confirmed that it had separated from the second stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in space, the space stock soared. It jumped from $4.98 on the day of the launch to touch nearly $11 over the course of the next few trading days. The jump in Intuitive Machines' share price underscored the potential of successful space missions and untapped investor eagerness to buy space stocks.\n\nHowever, this rise to glory would prove to be short lived and truly underscore the fragility of space exploration - one of the riskiest endeavors in the world. In a press conference after the lander touched down, Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR)'s management shared that oversight during final checkouts meant that Odysseus's landing sensors would not be online for landing. Consequently, engineers had to jerry rig a NASA payload on the lander to provide it with guidance, a procedure that led to (but might not have exclusively contributed to) the lander tipping over during landing. Instantly, the stock dropped by 30% in the aftermarket, and on the day the markets opened after the weekend, the shares reversed almost all price gains made post launch. Will hedge funds continue to hold Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) stock after the lunar lander oversight? You can check in next quarter to find out.\n\nWith this chilling example demonstrating the fragility of investing in space stocks, we nevertheless decided to see what the hedge funds were doing. Some of their top space stocks as of December 2023 are Telesat Corporation (NASDAQ:TSAT), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). 12 Best Space Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\nA close-up of an antenna, its intricate designs a testament to the company's expertise in space infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best space stocks, we ranked all publicly traded firms that either directly operate in the space industry or are major contributors to exploration efforts and the satellite industry by the number of hedge funds that had bought the stocks as of Q4 2023 end.\n\nFor these best space stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this article, we look at 15 militaries with the most armored fighting vehicles in the world, and discuss some of the leading manufacturers of armored combat vehicles and ongoing trends in the industry to enhance survivability of these vehicles. You can skip our detailed overview and head over directly to the 5 Militaries with the Most Armored Fighting Vehicles in the World.\n\nArmored fighting vehicles (AFVs) are partially or completely protected with armor and guard against incoming bullets, shells, and projectiles. The AFVs can move with wheels or continuous tracks, and have several classifications. The principal armored fighting vehicle is the tank, while infantry fighting vehicles, troop carriers, and amphibious vehicles are commonly used as well for military purposes.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is one of the leading companies in the industry and designs some of the best land combat machines available today, including wheeled and tracked vehicles, armored fighting vehicles, and battle tanks. In October 2023, it was reported that General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) beat Wall Street Journal\u2019s third quarter estimates as demand for its artillery and combat vehicles surged amid the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicle, Stryker, and M1 Abrams battle tanks have been instrumental in Ukraine\u2019s ongoing resistance efforts against Russia. An aid package announced by the United States in January 2023 for Kyiv included a fleet of 90 Stryker armored fighting vehicles. These were delivered in March and were first seen in action in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast in August.\n\nLater that year in October, Ukraine also received 31 M1 Abrams tanks worth $400 million from the US. These third-generation American battle tanks of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) are the most powerful tanks in the world, equipped with advanced electronics, improved self-defense systems, and powerful weapons.\n\nThe US military is also working on integrating combat vehicle protection systems to keep warfighters in armored vehicles and tanks safe from threats in the battlefield. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in 2021 was awarded a contract to provide Modular Active Protection System base-kits to test on Bradley, Stryker, and Abrams armored vehicles. These Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) kits integrate vehicle sensors which detect and defeat incoming threats like rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in April last year, the US Army also announced that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) would fit electronic and cyber warfare kits on Stryker armored vehicles to provide soldiers improved situational awareness on the battlefield. The deal is valued at $73 million.\n\nAnother company working on enhancing the survivability of armored fighting vehicles is RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), which in January this year received a $154 million contract to equip Bradley combat vehicles with advanced Commander\u2019s Independent Viewer (CIV) systems that come with FLIR cameras and sensors to deliver a 360 degree view of the battlefield. The production of these units by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) will take place in McKinsey, Texas, with delivery due in 2026.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has partnered with the US military on increasing the lethality, survivability, and battlefield awareness of the M1 Abrams tanks as well, and in July 2023 signed a $117.5 million agreement to install advanced targeting sensor systems in America\u2019s main battle tanks. 15 Militaries with the Most Armored Fighting Vehicles in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nMilitaries with the most armored fighting vehicles in the world are ranked in ascending order of their fleet size.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Home Depot, Inc. HD, T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS, General Electric Co. GE, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT and ICICI Bank Ltd. IBN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stocks Reports for Home Depot, T-Mobile and General Electric\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc., T-Mobile US, Inc. and General Electric Co. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nHome Depot\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past year (+31.1% vs. +30.0%). The company has been witnessing benefits from the execution of the \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience.\r\n\r\nThe interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters. It is on track with its strategic investments to build a Pro ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHowever, Home Depot's top and bottom-lines declined year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Results were impacted by deflation in lumber and copper prices and pressures from softness in big-ticket discretionary categories, which weighed on comps.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of T-Mobile have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+14.6% vs. +6.6%). The company recorded 5.7 million postpaid net customer additions and 2.1 million high-speed Internet net customer additions in fiscal 2023. Both metrics are the best in the industry.\r\n\r\nT-Mobile\u2019s 5G coverage exceeds 330 million people, a greater footprint than AT&T and Verizon combined. A higher adjusted free cash flow highlights efficiency in operations and implies that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives, pay debts and dividends.\r\n\r\nHowever, lower sales of prepaid and Assurance Wireless devices affected revenue from Equipment sales. Weak demand for prepaid services and declining prepaid ARPU is a headwind. A high debt burden and macroeconomic challenges remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\r\n\r\nGeneral Electric\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+85.3% vs. +13.2%). The company has been witnessing strength in its Aerospace segment, driven by robust demand for commercial engines and services. With strength in GE Gas Power services and growth in Grid and Onshore Wind businesses in North America, signs of improvement in GE Vernova (the combined operations of GE Power and Renewable) hold promise.\r\n\r\nAcquisitions made over time are also likely to be beneficial. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past six months. However, it has been dealing with high costs and operating expenses, which might affect its margins and profitability.\r\n\r\nSoftness in the company\u2019s Offshore wind business acts as a hindrance to the Renewable Energy segment. Supply chain disruptions in the defense market continue to take a toll on its operations. Also, foreign exchange headwinds might be worrying.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on General Electric here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lockheed Martin Corp. and ICICI Bank Ltd.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed at $431.98, marking a +0.01% move from the previous day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.02%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 1.04%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.65%.\n\nThe aerospace and defense company's shares have seen an increase of 2.43% over the last month, surpassing the Aerospace sector's gain of 2.05% and falling behind the S&P 500's gain of 3.64%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Lockheed Martin will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.89, indicating an 8.4% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $15.91 billion, indicating a 5.18% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $26.31 per share and revenue of $69.17 billion, indicating changes of -5.43% and +2.37%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.19% lower within the past month. Lockheed Martin presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note Lockheed Martin's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 16.42. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.09.\n\nMeanwhile, LMT's PEG ratio is currently 3.92. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Aerospace - Defense stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.89 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 88, finds itself in the top 35% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow LMT in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Lockheed Martin (LMT) standing at $431.94, reflecting a +1.28% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.12%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.25%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.41%.\n\nThe aerospace and defense company's shares have seen an increase of 0.12% over the last month, not keeping up with the Aerospace sector's gain of 1.19% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.83%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Lockheed Martin will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $5.89, reflecting an 8.4% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $15.91 billion, up 5.18% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $26.31 per share and a revenue of $69.17 billion, signifying shifts of -5.43% and +2.37%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.19% lower. Currently, Lockheed Martin is carrying a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Lockheed Martin has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.21 right now. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 17.61 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 3.87. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Aerospace - Defense industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.86.\n\nThe Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, putting it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Mercury Systems MRCY has secured a significant five-year contract worth $243.8 million from the U.S. Navy. This indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract is set to supply rapidly reprogrammable electronic attack training subsystems for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division.\r\n\r\nLeveraging more than 25 years of test and training technology from the Mercury Processing Platform, these subsystems aim to provide cutting-edge jamming and electronic warfare capabilities to U.S. pilot training organizations.\r\n\r\nMercury's digital RF memory (DRFM)-based reactive jamming subsystems offer flexibility, enabling training planners to swiftly reprogram missions across various aircraft through an intuitive software interface.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these systems can simulate multiple threats validated by the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. The company has a longstanding history of providing radar jamming capabilities to the Navy's Airborne Threat Simulation Organization (\u201cATSO\u201d), with more than 600 systems delivered in the past decade.\r\n\r\nMRCY initially received a $20.3 million production order for DRFM from ATSO, marking the commencement of this contract. Additionally, the agreement encompasses ongoing engineering services to continuously update the system's threat library to effectively counter adversarial capabilities.\n\nMRCY\u2019s Recent Deal to Aid Top-Line Growth\n\nMercury recently inked a significant three-year subcontract worth $96 million with Raytheon.

MRCY will provide hardware to support the production of the next nine LTAMDS radars, which will serve the U.S. Army and Poland, marking the first international LTAMDS customer.\r\n\r\nLTAMDS, featuring a 360-degree Active Electronically Scanned Array, offers enhanced capacity and capability against a broad spectrum of advanced threats, including hypersonic missiles. Mercury's development of an advanced and edge-ready processing solution for LTAMDS is poised to grant both the U.S. and international forces an unparalleled strategic and tactical advantage on the battlefield. This is expected to boost top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRCY\u2019s 2024 revenues is pegged at $812.17 million, indicating a year-over-year decrease of 16.61%. The consensus mark for loss is pegged at 64 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 164%.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have lost 18.7% year to date against the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 9.9% due to stiff competition in the market from Kratos Defense & Security Solutions KTOS, Lockheed Martin LMT and Elbit Systems ESLT.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions is a technology company based in San Diego, CA.

        "title": "Will Jeff Bezos Buy America's Most Venerable Space Company?",
        "content": "Call it the great cash out. Over just nine days in February, as Bloomberg reported on Feb. 20, Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos unloaded a total of 50 million shares of Amazon stock, netting $8.5 billion in proceeds -- nearly $1 billion per day of selling. Now inquiring minds want to know: What is Bezos planning to do with all the cash?\n\nOne possible answer: He's going to buy himself another space company.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance and Blue Origin: Together at last?\n\nFor the better part of a year now, rumors have swirled around the fate of United Launch Alliance, the rocket-launching joint venture formed by Boeing(NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) in 2005 -- and until SpaceX entered the national security launch market in 2016, America's primary means of delivering government satellites to orbit.\n\nArs Technica first broke the story back in March of 2023, and rumors soon sprang up about who might be bidding for ULA. Would Boeing -- or Lockheed -- try to buy out its partner? Might a second-tier space company like Northop Grumman(NYSE: NOC) try to expand its business by buying ULA? Or perhaps another defense giant, such as Textron(NYSE: TXT), would see buying ULA as a way to break into the space business itself?\n\nFrom the very start, however, one company always seemed the most likely to want to own ULA. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin was a rising star in space circles, and had a successful suborbital rocket and a budding space tourism business. It also built rocket engines for ULA, but had no actual, orbital rocket of its own with which to deliver payloads to orbit.\n\nWhat Blue Origin did have was a multi-multi-(multi)-billion-dollar founder in Jeff Bezos, and therefore easy access to the billions of dollars it would cost to take out ULA. And now, as the bidding for ULA finally nears its (presumed) end, wouldn't you know it?\n\nJeff Bezos is accessing those dollars himself, in a series of transactions yielding $8.5 billion. Cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nArs breaks the story again\n\nCiting unnamed sources, Ars Technica predicted last month that a sale of ULA was imminent, and might happen \"within a month or two.\" That timeline, coming so quickly on the heels of reports of Bezos selling Amazon stock, certainly does seem to suggest that Bezos (and Blue Origin) are laying the groundwork for a purchase of ULA.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the government would permit such a sale.\n\nOn the one hand, buying ULA would give Blue Origin immediate access to ULA's growing fleet of Vulcan Centaur orbital rockets -- for which Blue Origin itself already provides the engines -- as well as a host of contracts to launch the same for ULA customers. (Blue Origin therefore wouldn't have to wait to see if its planned New Glenn rocket can make a successful flight to enter the space race immediately.) At the same time, winning Bezos as a backer would give ULA an immediate cash infusion as it works to upgrade its technology to better compete with Elon Musk and SpaceX.\n\nOn the other hand, though, with Blue Origin so close to testing New Glenn, the U.S. Air Force is on the cusp of having three companies to choose from when picking its rocket rides -- and three companies bidding against each other to help keep prices down. Allowing ULA to merge into Blue Origin would derail that plan, at the very moment it might begin paying off for the government.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nI don't know about you, but if I were a government regulator right now, I'd be thinking that's a very good argument -- albeit a self-interested one -- for forbidding a merger between Blue Origin and ULA to proceed. If Boeing and Lockheed really feel compelled to sell their joint venture, I'd be inclined to agree to a sale to Textron, certainly, to Northop, probably, or to almost any other would-be buyer, possibly.\n\nThe one option I wouldn't want to see under any circumstances, though, is a purchase of ULA by Blue Origin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we look at 25 countries with the strongest armies in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the defense industry and head over directly to the 10 Countries with the Strongest Armies in the World.\n\nThe world has been embroiled in one-after-another conflict since the last few years. Afghanistan has collapsed to the Taliban. Azerbaijan and Armenia exchange regular fire in the Caucasus after the former seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenian control in 2020. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has gone beyond two years (737 days), with no immediate end in sight. And if that was not it, the Middle East is facing what analysts describe as the worst crisis in the region since 1973 after Israel launched a full-scale invasion of Gaza in response to Hamas\u2019 attacks on Israel in October last year.\n\nDefense spending reached a record-high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in military expenditure in three decades. While final figures for 2023 are still awaited, the need for weapons across the world amid ongoing escalations suggests the defense industry is set to continue booming, with companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) financially benefiting from the situation.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s revenue has grown 2.4% compared to 2022, to total a whopping $67.6 billion in 2023. The company\u2019s net earnings are also $1.2 billion higher than in the previous financial year. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s annual revenue figure of $68.9 billion was also 3% higher than in 2022. On the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) posted its record highest revenue in history of $42.3 billion in 2023, registering a 7.7% growth in comparison with 2022.\n\nIn October last year (2023), it was reported that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stocks had risen 2% after the company beat estimates and posted a higher than anticipated revenue during the third quarter of the year. According to analysts, the improved financial performance was owed to a sustained demand for weapons amid the ongoing military crises in different parts of the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has received orders worth $3 billion since Russia waged war on Ukraine in February 2022, with the aim being to replenish Kyiv. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s combat systems unit also generated a 25% YoY higher revenue during the third quarter of 2023. The unit, which manufactures tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, has already seen the output of its artillery increase from 4,000 rounds per month to 20,000. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the sixth largest defense contractor in the world heading into 2024. You can read more on this here.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)\u2019s share price has risen 6% since the declaration of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza in October last year. The company expects its revenue to be between $40.8 billion and $41.2 billion in 2024 due to an increasing demand for its weapons. The US Army awarded a $522 million contract to Global Military Products and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in early 2023 to manufacture artillery ammunition for Ukraine.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the strongest armies in the world. 25 Countries With The Strongest Armies In The World\n\nBPTU/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nSeveral weighted metrics have been considered in preparing the list of countries with the strongest armies in the world. These include manpower (10%), tanks (10%), armored fighting vehicles (10%), rocket projectors (10%), attack helicopters (15%), nuclear weapons (15%), GDP (10%), defense spending (10%), and technological capabilities (10%).\n\nData on tanks, manpower and nuclear weapons have been sourced from our recent article 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024. For the fleet size of armored fighting vehicles, attack helicopters, and rocket projectors, we referred to figures stated by the Global Firepower Index 2024.\n\n25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024 and 20 Countries With Highest Military Spending In The World were consulted for data related to GDP and defense spending. It must be noted that the GDP figures are for 2023, while for defense spending, 2022 is the latest year for which data is currently available. Lastly, the Global Innovation Index 2023 was used to determine the technological capabilities of countries.\n\nWe observed where countries ranked on each metric, and then multiplied their ranking with the weight for that metric. That gave us a weighted ranking for that country on a particular metric. For example, if a country ranked 1st on a metric weighed at 10%, it received a weighted ranking score of 0.1 (1x10%). This was done for all metrics considered in our research. Finally, all weighted ranking scores were aggregated to get an overall weighted ranking. Our list of the 25 countries with the strongest armies in the world is sorted in descending order of their overall weighted rankings.\n\nPlease note that the list is about strongest armies, not necessarily strongest militaries.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "(Adds no comment from Singapore defence ministry in paragraph 10)\n\nBy Gerry Doyle\n\nMarch 1 (Reuters) - Singapore will buy eight more F-35 stealth fighters, eventually replacing its older F-16s and putting the Singaporean air force \"in the premier league\" as regional threats grow, the city-state's defence minister said this week.\n\nDefence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) would buy F-35As - a larger, longer-range variant of the Lockheed Martin Corp jets - to complement the 12 F-35Bs it has already ordered.\n\nThe first F-35Bs will be delivered to Singapore in 2026, Ng said.\n\nThe B model is capable of taking off and landing vertically, a crucial part of operating off ships, or in places without traditional runways.\n\n\"The F-35As are designed for greater endurance and have the ability to carry payloads of higher capacity,\" Ng said in explaining the decision to parliament. \"They complement the F-35Bs, which have short take-off and vertical landing capability.\"\n\nThe purchase, and long-term replacement of its several dozen F-16s with F-35s starting in the mid-2030s, show the RSAF has noted the growing capability of China's People's Liberation Army Air Force, which has begun flying advanced aircraft such as the J-20B, said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\n\"This elevates Singapore even further ahead of other Southeast Asian air forces,\" Davis said, adding that with Australia, South Korea, Japan and the United States also flying F-35s in the region, there were opportunities for common maintenance and support arrangements.\n\nNg did not disclose the cost of the purchase during remarks to Singapore's parliament on Wednesday. The F-35 unit price can vary depending on customer and model; last year the U.S. Department of Defense awarded a $7.8 billion contract to Lockheed Martin for 126 F-35s.\n\nLockheed Martin declined to comment on the unit price or total value of the deal, saying in a statement it was \"honoured that the Singaporean government has selected the F-35A as part of the RSAF's future fighter aircraft fleet\".\n\nStory continues\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the unit cost or total cost of the aircraft.\n\nThousands of F-35s are in service with the United States and its allies globally.\n\nSingapore's defence budget will increase 2.5% in the next fiscal year, to S$20.2 billion, Ng said.\n\n\"The risk of regional and even global conflict even in the next decade has become non-zero,\" Ng told parliament. \"I do not make this assessment lightly.\" (Reporting by Gerry Doyle; Additional reporting by Xinghui Kok; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)",

        "title": "20 Countries with Most Bombers and Superior Air Force",
        "content": "In this article, we look at 20 countries with the most bombers and superior air force. You can skip our detailed overview of trends in the aerospace industry and directly head over to the 5 Countries with Most Bombers and Superior Air Force.\n\nCountries around the world are upgrading their air forces with fleets of newer, advanced fighter jets and bombers to enhance their aerial capabilities. These aircraft play a key role in securing control over enemy airspace. According to Flight Global, there were 53,265 military aircraft in the world in 2022, with a quarter (25%) of them being flown by the United States, followed by Russia (8%) and China (6%). A recent report by the Military Embedded Systems noted that about 39% of the world\u2019s fighter jets are also operated by the United States, with China at a distant second at 24.4%. These statistics speak volumes of Washington\u2019s aerial superiority over its rivals, which is likely to continue given the current trends.\n\nWork is already underway in the United States to develop a sixth-generation fighter jet to replace the F-22 Raptor, built by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), by 2030. The highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program launched by the US Air Force (USAF) in 2014 is likely to cost $16 billion between 2023 and 2028, with a request for $1.7 billion put forward by the USAF to allocate in its FY24 budget.\n\nIn August 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s subsidiary Pratt & Whitney received contracts worth $975 million each to work on NGAD over the following ten years.\n\nThe Americans are also ahead in the race when it comes to bomber aircraft, which are designed to launch air-to-ground bombs to strike surface targets. The US has built 744 B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers to-date, of which about 76 are still flying today. Designed in 1952 by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), the aircraft can carry up to 32,000 kilograms of weapons, with a combat range of 14,200 kilometers without requiring aerial refueling. The B-52 has been a symbol of American strength for decades now, and was recently sent to Iraq and Syria to crush ISIS. As of 2012, the price of a B-52 Stratofortress bomber was estimated to be $84 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAround 45 B-1 Lancer bombers are also in the current fleet of the USAF. Introduced in the 1970s, these were manufactured by Rockwill International until their B-1 division was acquired by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which has since been the primary contractor for this aircraft. The aircraft is powered by General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)\u2019s F101-GE-102 afterburning turbofan engines.\n\nThe most recent bomber aircraft in use by the USAF are the B-2 Spirit, manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) during the 1980s. About 21 units of the aircraft have been built to-date, with each unit costing around $280 million. These strategic bombers of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) come with low-observable stealth technology which enable the bombers to penetrate even dense anti-aircraft defenses. 20 Countries with Most Bombers and Superior Air Force\n\nMethodology\n\nSince there are just a handful of countries that currently have bombers, we have factored in the advancement of fighter jets of different air forces to compile a list of 20. Countries that are equipped with bombers are ranked higher than those that have none. For the latter, we have considered the strength of fighter jets, with our main focus being on the number of fourth-generation and fifth-generation fighter jets operated by their air forces. The aircraft fleet size of air forces are also part of our analysis.\n\nWeights were assigned to metrics that were considered for this article. 50% to fifth-generation fighter jets, 40% to fourth-generation fighter jets, and 10% to the air force\u2019s fleet size of aircraft. Weighted scores for these metrics were then aggregated to get an overall score. 20 Countries with Most Bombers and Superior Air Force are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores \u2013 with countries with bombers taking the top spots.\n\nData on advanced fighter jets was sourced from FlightGlobal\u2019s Flight International publication titled World Air Forces 2023. For the fleet size of air forces, we referred to our recent article on the 20 Largest Air Forces in the World Heading into 2024, while Military Embedded Systems' reportThe global market for fighter planes and bombers was consulted for the number of bombers for each country.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 most valuable space companies in the world. If you want to skip our introduction to the global space industry and all the latest news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Valuable Space Companies in the World.\n\nJust as high technology industries such as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence have rapidly grown at levels that would have been thought unimaginable at the turn of this century, space exploration is another sector that has rapidly captured the public imagination. While space has always been a popular endeavor, after the Space Shuttle's retirement, the U.S. space industry slowed down at least as far as launch vehicle development is concerned. After the Shuttle, while rockets such as the United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas lineup continued to launch top secret national security payloads, the heart of space exploration \u2014 crewed missions to low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond \u2014 took place only from Russia.\n\nHowever, ever since SpaceX successfully flew the Crew Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS) with NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida has been bustling with activity. At the same time, other crewed spacecraft commissioned by the space agency have also been developing their spacecraft. While SpaceX's Crew Dragon remains the only U.S. spacecraft certified by NASA for orbital spaceflight, the other spacecraft currently being developed for NASA contracts is The Boeing Company's (NYSE:BA) Starliner. Additionally, Sierra Space is developing its Dream Chaser space plane, initially for NASA cargo contracts.\n\nThis intermix of private space companies vying for NASA awards is also the 21st century version of the space agency. For the U.S. space industry, NASA's operating model prior to Shuttle's retirement saw the agency engage itself with its private space company contractors during every step of a vehicle's design. Once the design was finished and the end product went through multiple tests certifying it for flight, NASA took ownership of the vehicle and operated it on its now.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, the most valuable space companies in the world are those that are capable of operating their own rockets and serving the needs of a myriad of government and private sector contractors in addition to the world's leading space agency. In fact, the extent to which this principle has taken hold over the space industry is evident by the fact that you really didn't have to read this piece to know which company is the most valuable space company in the world. SpaceX is a household name by now, and it's the biggest space company in the world as far as market capitalization is concerned.\n\nWhile we'll get to SpaceX's market capitalization later, the firm's dominance in the launch vehicle industry is clear by the fact that February 2024 marked a unique achievement for the company and the global space industry. This is because in mid February, before SpaceX launched a mission for the U.S. Space Force, the firm became the only one in human history to have had four rockets vertical at four launch pads. While SpaceX's rocket launch for the space force was ready for lift off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, it was ready to launch NASA payloads on an Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) lunar lander, had placed the Falcon 9 vertical for a Starlink launch from California and stacked the Starship second stage spacecraft on the Super Heavy booster in Boca Chica, Texas.\n\nThis latest tryst came when the space company stock NASDAQ:LUNR soared by double digit percentages on the stock market. Why did Intuitive Machines's shares soar? Well, its Nova C Odysseus lunar lander marked America's second attempt to land a lander on the Moon since the Apollo era. The first attempt had come earlier this year, when Pittsburgh based Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander kicked off the NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, but Intuitive Machines's lunar lander seemed to have caught investors' eyes since it promises to make a lunar landing attempt in just a week after its launch.\n\nThe Intuitive Machines Odysseus lunar lander will use a methane powered rocket engine for its journey to the Moon, and the firm successfully managed early post launch complications by feeding new commands to the lander's guidance and navigation systems from Earth.\n\nThe Odysseus launch coupled with the SpaceX Starship and NASA Artemis programs marks a new era for space companies stocks. It also means that companies like SpaceX have started to become like NASA in their operations. Prior to the Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon, NASA's crewed launches were managed by the agency's controllers. Now, SpaceX is responsible for the astronauts' journey to the station, and this is not through accident. When it comes to private space companies vs NASA, the space agency also finds it easier to scale up human spaceflight programs by offshoring some of the risks involved in sending humans at speeds of thousands of kilometers per hour in the Earth's atmosphere and into space. While NASA's Space Shuttle program completed 133 successful flights over three decades, its two notable accidents that led to the demise of all crew on board are still the biggest criticism that its detractors have.\n\nFinally, before we take the wraps off of the most valuable and biggest space companies in the world, it's important to note that while firms such as SpaceX and Boeing are among the most widely discussed space stocks, the sector as a whole is quite diversified. Broadly speaking, space stocks can be divided into two categories. The first is of firms that make space vehicles like SpaceX's Falcon 9, Boeing's Starliner and SLS for NASA, and Intuitive Machines' Odysseus. The second belongs to satellite companies such as Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) whose bread and butter is based on operating imaging, telecommunications, and other satellites. Of course, before anyone points out, SpaceX is also a satellite company since its Starlink satellite internet constellation is now made of nearly six thousand small telecommunications satellites.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the most valuable space companies in the world. In this list, some notable space stocks that are publicly available for trading are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (OTC:MHVYF), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). 20 Most Valuable Space Companies in the World\n\nA close-up of an antenna, its intricate designs a testament to the company's expertise in space infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most valuable space companies in the world, we first ranked all publicly traded companies that are either pureplay rocket or satellite companies or have sizeable space business divisions that are relied on by government agencies.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +0.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $5.89 per share, indicating a change of -8.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.4%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.51 indicates a change of +8.4% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $69.17 billion and $71.88 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +3.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $18.87 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.6%. EPS of $7.90 for the same period compares with $7.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.98 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.96%. The EPS surprise was +8.82%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with HII.\n\nFor instance, last year, President Biden allotted more than $816.7 billion in federal funding for the Defense Department after signing the Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act into law.\n\nFor the 2024/25 financial year, the UK is projected to spend more than $60 billion in real cash terms on their defense budget, an almost $20 billion increase compared to the 2020/21 financial year. Over in Europe, NATO Allies will be spending 2% of their combined GDP on defense for the first time. Allies will be investing more than $380 billion into defense programs, including the replenishing of their stockpiles.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that war makes money, and global superpowers are pumping billions into defense and aerospace companies to help bolster national defense programs and transform legacy strategies with cutting-edge technology.\n\nAerospace And Defense Stock Diversification\n\nContinuing uncertainty across the Middle East and geopolitical hotspots around the world could help U.S. defense contractors bolster their earnings in the coming months. For investors, this could be a time to load up on aerospace and defense stocks, although the answer to this is not as clear-cut as one might think.\n\nFor instance, following the initial attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF soared roughly 7%. Back in February 2022, the MSCI World Aerospace and Defense Industry Index and MSCI World Index managed to outperform the market following the invasion of Ukraine by neighboring Russia.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, the instability experienced across parts of the Middle East and in Ukraine has been a regularity for many of these funds. Yet, based on historic events that have played a significant role in the performance of aerospace and defense stocks, the consensus remains that near-term political intervention can leave stocks flip-flopping when compared to the broader market.\n\nIn that case, investors usually look at filling their portfolios with stocks that can provide long-term stability, rather than short-term gains. More than this, aerospace and defense stocks tend to lag behind the general market, and only experience rapid intervals of growth following the outbreak of war or conflict. Working with such a strategy would require investors to consider a mix of diverse defense options that provide them with an assumed outcome further supported by a forward-looking strategy and consider the play between supply and demand.\n\nFinding Companies In Key Market Positions\n\nThe bereaved reality of current affairs provides investors with an opportunity to consider long-term defense players that could be a complimentary addition to their portfolios. However, for some, the question regarding the political and social climate under which these companies operate only further creates a more moral-like challenge for investors looking to promote ESG-centered investment strategies.\n\nWith the continued conflict sweeping across parts of the world, here's a rundown of the defense companies that could provide investors with some stability and long-term gain.\n\nNorthrop Grumman\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is one of the largest U.S. Department of Defense contractors, and provides global aerospace, defense, and security products and services to a large portfolio of governments, outside of the United States.\n\nCommercial partners include Australia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and the Middle East. Northrop Grumman focuses on global security provision, with a portion of their business portfolio dedicated to nuclear security, including missiles, submarines, and stealth bombers.\n\nDuring the Q4 2023 financial reporting call, Chair, CEO, and President of Northrop Grumman, Kathy Warden shared that the current geopolitical landscape has allowed them to position their strategy well to compete and win in the growing market.\n\nRecent developments taking shape across the world have added to the company's top line, including a revenue increase of over 7 percent in 2023. Furthermore, the company ended the year with more than $1 billion above its midpoint compared to its original 2023 guidance.\n\nOverall, the company is currently in a positive position, with a $84.2 billion backlog for 2023, and seeing nearly $40 billion in sales for the full year.\n\nLast year, following the initial attacks in Israel, NOC rose by nearly 12% in a single day before sliding and rising another 6% in the following days. Year-to-date (YTD) performance is down slightly by 4%, however, the company's diverse business portfolio and mixed product offering are helping it remain at the top spot of investors.\n\nGeneral Electric\n\nFormed by the multinational conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE), GE Aerospace might not be the newest kid on the block, however, the company is taking off at full speed, and seeing major partnerships with the U.S. government, and more importantly, the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nGE Aerospace offers commercial military and water propulsion engine capabilities. According to the company, GE Aerospace has been assigned to produce aircraft engines for 100% of new production F-15s ordered during the last decade, including all Advanced F-15 aircraft.\n\nFor Q4 2023, General Electric reported a steady 7 percent increase in organic orders, which totaled more than $21.7 billion, and represented an 8% increase from the previous quarter. For the full year however, orders totaled more than $79.2 billion, which was a total 25% increase in yearly orders and organic orders.\n\nElsewhere, GE Aerospace managed to deliver higher-than-expected orders for the fourth quarter and managed to deliver double-digit growth for the full year. Overall, the company claims that commercial support and strength in services currently represent 70% of GE Aerospace revenue.\n\nGE Aerospace signed a lucrative deal with Emirates following an order of 202 GE9X engines and spares. This partnership will help to power the Dubai-based airline operator fleet of Boeing 777X, and totaling Emirates' total order of GE9X engines to 460.\n\nFor investors, GE could be a suitable option that helps to provide them with stability, but more than this, access to General Electric's diverse business profile, which includes both GE Aerospace and their renewable energy arm, GE Vernova, which experienced an operating improvement of $1 billion for the fiscal 2023 year.\n\nParsons Corporation\n\nParsons Corp (NYSE:PSN) is a global security and defense technology company that generates most of its revenue from federal and state-funded contracts.\n\nAlready this year, Parsons has been awarded several high-value contracts, including a $48 million task order for army command and control system integrations. Then there's a $25 million transit improvement contract awarded by the City of Oakland; a $115 million Department of Labor Facilities Management project, and the company has been included in a $200 million GSA construction management contract.\n\nParsons has a robust business strategy, which allows them to oversee multiple projects, ranging from cyber security infrastructure, nation security, and intelligence including energy infrastructure, water and wastewater development, transportation, and urban development.\n\nBased on fourth-quarter financial results, Parsons ended the year on a high note, including organic revenue growth of 34%, and roughly $1.5 billion in full-year revenue, an increase of roughly 35% year over year.\n\nCritical infrastructure revenue, which oversees federal security and intelligence projects witnessed similar growth, with revenue increasing $111 million, or 21% to roughly $651 million. The company claims that organic growth of 20% was the largest contributor, and increasing activity volumes in the Middle East and North America were mostly responsible for the positive organic revenue turnaround.\n\nFor 2024, PSN shares have already managed to climb by 19.65%, with shares seeing a significant boost of 11% halfway through February. Looking at the longer scale, PSN is more than 60% up from the same time last year, with share prices now above $74.00 per share, compared to $44.47 per share last year this time.\n\nAgain, Parsons is in that sweet spot where investors would want it to be. The company has reported positive fundamentals, has positive forward-looking guidance, and has closely partnered with several government agencies that will help keep them in business for the next several years, at least.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nA list of defense stocks isn't complete without Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). As one of the top suppliers for the U.S. government, seeing more than 18 contracts since 2018, totaling more than $5 billion, and with $1.9 billion of NASA contracts since 2019, Lockheed is a leading pioneer in all-domain operations for both military and commercial customers.\n\nAlready, investors are well aware of the company's seemingly lucrative portfolio, which includes projects such as military and defense aircraft, maritime systems, sustainment and training systems, cybersecurity, autonomy, artificial intelligence (AI), and transformative technology.\n\nWhere there's government money and contrast involved, there's a good chance that Lockheed Martin is following closely behind. Last year proved to be yet another successful year for the company, reporting more than $67.6 billion in full-year sales, and a total of $18.9 billion in fourth-quarter sales. For the fourth quarter, the company reported more than $2.4 billion in cash from operations, and over $1.7 billion in free cash flow for the same quarter.\n\nThe company has released its 2024 financial outlook, and most of its guidance is around holding up a free cash flow above $6 billion. For 2024, Lockheed is aiming to have free cash flow between $6.0 billion and $6.3 billion, compared to $6.2 billion in 2023.\n\nElsewhere, the company is further planning to improve its joint procurement policies with both public and private partners, improve favorable negotiation terms with the U.S. government, and further determine the risk assessment, development, sustainment, performance, and delivery of programs, including the F-35 aircraft program.\n\nThere is however a downside to LMT at the moment. Analysts that have been touting the idea of LMT reaching above $500 per share are now finding it fairly difficult to support their performance guidance following the announcement of President Biden looking to cut F-35 aircraft delivery by 18%.\n\nWhat's more, potential budget cuts by the Department of Defense could further hamper forward-looking growth for LMT, and push stock prices lower, despite the ongoing uncertainty across tension-riddled hotspots around the world.\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries Inc\n\nHuntington (NYSE:HII) is considered to be one of the largest military ship and sea vessel manufacturers in the United States. The company has over 135 years of experience in naval ship design, construction, and integration. Advancements in technology have further enabled the company to tap into new opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI) and electronic warfare systems to design and build unmanned and completely autonomous training.\n\nJumping right into their financials, HII reported recorded annual revenues of more than $11.5 billion, increasing more than 7.3 percent year over year. On a quarterly basis, revenues rose 3.2% year over year and were up to $3.2 billion.\n\nThe positive revenue turnaround was largely due to better-than-expected performance across all business segments, and the total backlog increased to more than $48.1 billion due to more than $12.5 billion in new contracts being awarded throughout last year.\n\nTheir financial outlook for the year ahead shows the company looking to boost its shipbuilding revenue performance between $8l8 and $9.1 billion, with an operating margin between 7.6% and 7.8%. Elsewhere, mission technologies are also expected to outperform current margins, with the forward guidance set at between $2.7 to $2.75 billion segment operation revenue.\n\nAs part of its mission statement for the year ahead, the company has told shareholders that various key factors, including labor market challenges, supply chain disruptions, costs relating to pension and healthcare costs, cyber security threats, and other future disruptions are some of their main priorities this year.\n\nTension in the waters around the Middle East could further bolster Hunting Ingal's performance this year, as the U.S. has already started deploying ships to the region following the Israeli-Hamas and now Somali-backed Houthi attacks taking place in the region.\n\nCould this fallout bring Huntington new contracts in the near future requires further consideration, however, for investors this brings a long-term strategy that could help them take better advantage of conflict scenarios that could help boost their portfolio's performance.\n\nFinishing Off\n\nAnother year of war and conflict is driving investors to lock in defense stocks in an attempt to tap into new opportunities that can provide them with a long-term strategic ability to outperform weaker markets, and steadily ride on the back of defense companies reeling in billions in government contracts and funding.\n\nHowever, investors are wondering whether all this conflict and tension could actually help bolster company performance on the stock market. Better yet, understanding the long-term need for these companies at a time when more investors are hoping to move towards ESG-focused investments could play in direct opposition to their investment goals.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Insights into Lockheed Martin Corp's Upcoming Dividend Payment and Its Sustainability\n\nLockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) recently announced a dividend of $3.15 per share, payable on 2024-03-29, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-02-29. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Lockheed Martin Corp's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.\n\nWhat Does Lockheed Martin Corp Do?\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with LMT. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nLockheed Martin is the world's largest defense contractor and has dominated the Western market for high-end fighter aircraft since it won the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in 2001. Lockheed Martin's largest segment is aeronautics, which derives upward of two-thirds of its revenue from the F-35. Lockheed Martin's remaining segments are rotary and mission systems, which is mainly the Sikorsky helicopter business; missiles and fire control, which creates missiles and missile defense systems; and space systems, which produces satellites and receives equity income from the United Launch Alliance joint venture. Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nA Glimpse at Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend History\n\nLockheed Martin Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1995, distributing dividends on a quarterly basis. The company has increased its dividend each year since 2000, earning the title of a dividend achiever, a distinction given to companies that have raised their dividend for at least the past 24 years. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends. Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nBreaking Down Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Yield and Growth\n\nAs of today, Lockheed Martin Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.83% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.94%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Lockheed Martin Corp's annual dividend growth rate was 7.40%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 8.20% per year. And over the past decade, Lockheed Martin Corp's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 9.70%. Based on Lockheed Martin Corp's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Lockheed Martin Corp stock as of today is approximately 4.20%.\n\nStory continues Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Lockheed Martin Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.43.\n\nLockheed Martin Corp's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Lockheed Martin Corp's profitability 9 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.\n\nGrowth Metrics: The Future Outlook\n\nLockheed Martin Corp's growth rank of 9 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Lockheed Martin Corp's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model, with revenue increasing by approximately 5.00% per year on average, outperforming approximately 50.38% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run, with earnings increasing by approximately 4.00% per year on average, outperforming approximately 47.25% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 6.30%, outperforms approximately 52.71% of global competitors, indicating strong prospects for future profitability and dividend sustainability.\n\nConcluding Thoughts on Lockheed Martin Corp's Dividend Outlook\n\nLockheed Martin Corp's consistent dividend payments, robust dividend growth rate, manageable payout ratio, and strong profitability and growth metrics paint a picture of a reliable dividend-paying stock. The company's strategic position as a leading defense contractor, combined with its financial health, suggests that it is well-equipped to continue rewarding shareholders with dividends. Investors considering Lockheed Martin Corp for its dividend prospects should also consider the company's ability to maintain these payments in the face of industry trends, regulatory factors, and technological advancements. Will Lockheed Martin Corp continue to provide a secure and growing dividend in the years to come?

        "title": "11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 11 countries with the best military special forces in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on the most formidable and well-trained units a country can boast and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World.\n\nThe concept of special forces varies among different countries. While some view them as elite soldiers of the military, others consider the forces as special units of the armed forces tasked to perform specialized operations. Irrespective of how their roles are interpreted, the special forces are made up of the finest soldiers recruited from across the country.\n\nWhat makes these soldiers special is their level of training and personality traits such as strong mentality and bravery. They are also equipped with state-of-the-art military hardware that allows them to dominate the battlefield and overcome challenging scenarios that come in their way. For instance, according to an analysis on Business Insider, weapons and gear the US military special forces head to the field with include assault rifles such as the M4A1 and MK18, the MK46 and MK48 machine guns, as well as other vital equipment like night-vision goggles, first aid kits, GPS devices, ballistic helmets, and belts. It is common for these troops to carry grenade launchers and anti-tank missiles as well if they need to.\n\nThe FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile, jointly developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), had been deployed extensively by the United States in its combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The American forces had experienced over 5,000 engagements with this weapon system during the war in these two countries, as noted by defense news website, Army Technology.\n\nMore than 45,000 units of these portable and platform-employed anti tank missiles had been produced until 2019 by these companies since its first launch in 1996. While RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) builds the command launch unit (CLU), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shoulders the responsibility of assembling the missile itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nJavelin is being widely used by the Ukrainian military as well to repulse Russian invasion of their country. According to a report, as of late August 2023, the US had provided over 10,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kyiv, which has helped Ukraine in keeping Russia at bay from the capital. Owing to the demand for this weapon, both Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) have been taking measures to increase Javelin production from 2,000 units to 3,500 per year.\n\nOn the other hand, the Remington Modular Sniper Rifle (MSR) is a key weapon in the Delta Force arsenal that is enhancing the operational effectiveness of the elite group. Launched to enter service in 2013, the MSR has a firing range of 4,920 feet and a rate of 12 shots per minute. The sniper has also received acclaim from defense experts for its modularity that allows users customizable configurations of the equipment. In 2013, each unit cost around $15,000, according to a report.\n\nMoreover, large defense sector corporations also offer tactical and strategic support to the special forces. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s information technology unit in 2016 was awarded a contract to provide professional support services to the American special operation forces in carrying out their global missions. Under the agreement, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was to provide infinite delivery of services for an indefinite time period, with a maximum ceiling of $900 million over five years. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the sixth largest defense contractor in the world, and posted its highest-ever revenue of $42.3 billion last year. You can read more on this in our article on the Top 20 Defense Contractors in 2024. 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World\n\nCopyright: zabelin / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 11 countries with the best military special forces in the world are ranked based on a consensus method, where we analyzed three sources \u2013 The Independent, The Times of India, and Forces.net. While the first source ranked various special forces (out of 8) on their capabilities, the other two websites discussed these units without ranking them.\n\nIn the first case, we observed where each unit ranked and assigned scores to the country, depending on where its special forces group (s) ranked. For instance, if a country ranked first, it received a score of 1 (8/8); if it was third, it received 0.75 (6/8). For the remaining two sources, we counted the number of times a military special forces group was mentioned on these websites and assigned a score of 1 for each time they received a mention. Finally all scores were aggregated to get an overall score. Countries with the best military forces in the world are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores. In cases where two or more countries had the same score, we outranked one over the other on the battle-hardness of their special forces.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of countries with the best military special forces.\n\nTop 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World:\n\n11. Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nScore: 0.25\n\nSpain, with its Unidad de Operaciones Especiales, has one of the best military special forces in the world. Since June 2009, the group has been absorbed into the Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial, or Special Naval Warfare Force, which has inherited its reputation. What started off in 1952 as the Amphibious Climbing Company has grown into being among the most respected special forces in Europe. According to The Independent, the force has a rejection rate of around 80%.\n\n10. MARCOS\n\nCountry: India\n\nScore: 1.00\n\nIndia finds itself among countries with the best military special forces in the world, with three special forces that are controlled by the military. These include the Army\u2019s Paratrooper Special Forces, Navy\u2019s MARCOS, and the Air Force\u2019s Garud Commando Force. The Marine Commandos, abbreviated as MARCOS, are the most widely acclaimed special forces group in the country. According to The Times of India, it takes about three years of rigorous training before soldiers could become a part of this special unit. MARCOS is capable of operations at sea, land, and air.\n\n9. Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nScore: 1.00\n\nKommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte (KSK) is the elite special force of the Bundeswehr \u2014 the German military. It is a large brigade-level unit, that is tasked with performing a wide range of operations as required related to counter-terrorism, commando warfare, and search and rescue. However, like all other Germany units, KSK's deployments have to be authorized by the German parliament. The unit carried out several successful operations during the war against terrorism in Afghanistan, including a raid on an Al Qaeda safehouse in 2006. Germany also has another top special services group in GSG 9 der Bundespolizei, which is the special forces unit of the German Police, and plays an active role in combating terrorism and organized crime. Primarily due to these two agencies, Germany finds itself in the list of countries with the best military special forces in the world.\n\n8. Joint Task Force 2 (JST2)\n\nCountry: Canada\n\nScore: 2.00\n\nThe Joint Task Force 2 (JST2) is an elite, tier 1 special forces group of the Canadian military, and serves under the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command. The unit is tasked with working on counter-terrorism missions, both at home and abroad, and has come to be recognized as a world-class special force. The JST2 is known to collaborate closely with the Delta Force in the US and Britain\u2019s Special Air Service (SAS) in missions of common interest.\n\n7. GROM Military Unit\n\nCountry: Poland\n\nScore: 2.00\n\nPoland\u2019s GROM Military Unit is one of the best military special forces in the world. It is a top-tier special forces unit that can be compared with the best of the best. The group was formed in 1990 as part of a mission to help Soviet Jews enter Israel safely amid resistance from Hezbollah. These days, GROM is a highly-capable anti-terrorism unit, which has successfully undertaken several missions at home and overseas. One of its most notable operations was the rescue of hostages after terrorists took control of a government building in Paktia, Afghanistan in 2012.\n\n6. Special Services Group (SSG)\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nScore: 2.00\n\nPakistan\u2019s Special Services Group, or SSG, is one of the best military special forces units in the world. The unit is also known as the Black Storks, due to the unique headgear worn by its commandos. The Independent and Force.net have both highlighted that SSG\u2019s training involves a 36-mile march in 12 hours, as well as a 5-mile sprint in just 20 minutes, while only 5% of those who enter training pass out upon completion of the course. The SSG is a battle-hardened force that is undertaken some of the most complex missions during Pakistan's war against militant groups in the country's tribal north and come out successful.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed at $430.43, marking a +0.29% move from the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.17%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.25%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.37%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 0.27% over the past month, lagging the Aerospace sector's gain of 2.61% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.8% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Lockheed Martin in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.89, indicating an 8.4% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $15.91 billion, reflecting a 5.18% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nLMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $26.31 per share and revenue of $69.17 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -5.43% and +2.37%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

Lockheed Martin presently features a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Lockheed Martin is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 16.31. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.27.\n\nMeanwhile, LMT's PEG ratio is currently 3.9. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, finds itself in the top 36% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

        "title": "7 Galactic Stocks for Cosmic Gains in the Space Race",
        "content": "There are some great space stocks up for grabs as we enter into March this year. I believe that some of the best investment opportunities lie in this industry. We\u2019re still in the very early stages of seeing its development. Some companies are already making big moves that give promise for great returns for investors.\n\nThere are many opportunities for investors to capitalize on the growing space industry, which includes satellite communication, space tourism, and even asteroid mining. As governments and private companies increase their investments in space exploration and technology, the potential for innovation and profitability in this sector becomes even more apparent.\n\nSo, for this article, I\u2019ve put together a list of seven of the most promising space stocks that are all vying for your investment dollars. The companies are some of the best that the market has to offer. I think investors of all degrees of risk tolerances can consider them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is pioneering commercial human spaceflight, offering space tourists the chance of a lifetime to venture into space.\n\nAlthough SPCE has seen its stock price fall deeply into penny stock territory, down 83.68% over the past five years, the company has outlined plans for growth and survival through at least 2026, suggesting a focus on overcoming past hurdles and capitalizing on future opportunities.\n\nFor 2024, Virgin Galactic\u2019s guidance and outlook involve continuing its space tourism and research missions. The company\u2019s plans include a notable shift towards developing its next-generation spacecraft.\n\nIn terms of valuation and analyst ratings, SPCE has been deemed undervalued by some analysts following its recent price drops. This suggests that the market may not fully account for the company\u2019s potential growth or recovery. This then makes it one of those space stocks to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nEchoStar Corporation (SATS) A photo of a satellite over earth.\n\nSource: AlexLMX / Shutterstock\n\nEchoStar Corporation (NASDAQ:SATS) delivers satellite communication solutions, specializing in broadband internet services across the Americas. The company has taken significant steps so far in 2024. Notably, its merger with DISH Network Corporation, aiming to enhance its strategic value. The merger is expected to provide EchoStar with substantial net cash generated from DISH\u2019s pay-TV subscriber base. This will aid in debt reduction.\n\nOther efforts in 2023 saw an expansion of its subscriber base and enhancing its service offerings. These included the introduction of rewards programs and advancements in data audience targeting for advertisers.\n\nWall Street seems to appreciate SAT\u2019s efforts, as it has a consensus rating of \u201cBuy.\u201d This also comes with an 89.42% predicted increase for its stock price to be realized over the next twelve months. Analyst Philip Cusick from JP Morgan also rated SATS as a \u201cHold\u201d but gave it a $18 price target, representing a 42.07% upside.\n\nRocket Lab (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) has commenced 2024 with a successful launch, marking the beginning of its busiest year thus far. The company\u2019s first mission of the year was focused on deploying Space Situational Awareness (SSA) satellites for Spire Global (NYSE:SPIR) and NorthStar Earth & Space.\n\nThis reflects some much-needed good news for RKLB stock. It has lost 55.40% of its stock price value for the past five years. This is amid a backdrop of failed launches and cash flow concerns for the company.\n\nBut looking ahead, Rocket Lab\u2019s launch schedule for 2024 is fully booked, featuring a mix of commercial and defense sector missions, including multiple launches for NASA and hypersonic technology tests. Analysts are also bullish on Rocket Lab, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating. The average price target among eight analysts stands at $7.88, suggesting a significant potential upside from the current stock price.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.\n\nSource: viper-zero / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is a defense and aerospace technology firm with a strong footprint in the space industry.\n\nThe company reported a strong performance for 2023, with optimistic projections for 2024. In 2023, the company saw a 7% increase in revenue, with a record backlog exceeding $84 billion. It returned $2.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Furthermore, it plans to escalate share repurchases to at least $2 billion in 2024.\n\nFor 2024, Northrop Grumman has outlined specific financial targets, expecting sales to range from $40.8 billion to $41.2 billion and operating income between $4.215 billion and $4.29 billion. Furthermore, NOC\u2019s EPS is expected to surge 80.84% this year to 24.47, while a marginal 5.66% improvement in its revenue is also on the cards, which would send it to 41.52 billion.\n\nI feel that NOC would be a great pick for investors who want to invest in one of these high-performing space stocks while also diversifying their portfolio with a defense stock. This factor makes NOC particularly attractive.\n\nBoeing (BA) Royal Air Force Boeing (BA) Chinook HC2A (352) [ZH895] lifting off from runway\n\nSource: InsectWorld / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing\u2019s (NYSE:BA) Defense, Space & Security segment undertakes the development of satellites, human space flight, and launch systems. It\u2019s an underappreciated name in the space industry that I feel deserves more attention than it receives.\n\nThe company recently reported its Q4 2023 results. The 737 program is producing at a rate of 38 per month, while the 787 rate is five per month. The Defense, Space & Security segment saw an 8% revenue increase to $24.93 billion for the full year. Meanwhile, Global Services also grew, with a 9% increase in yearly revenue to $19.13 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, BA stock should be a prime candidate for anyone interested in space stocks. Boeing is actively working on the core stages for Artemis II-V missions, which are aimed at returning humans to the Moon and, eventually, Mars. Boeing is the prime contractor for the design, development, test, and production of the SLS core stage, upper stages, and flight avionics suite and was part of the Artemis I Mission on Nov. 16, 2022.\n\nBA is likely to play a pivotal role in human space exploration, and investors should keep the big picture in mind.\n\nSafran (SAFRY) Rocket launching into space\n\nSource: 3Dsculptor / Shutterstock.com\n\nSafran (OTCMKTS:SAFRY) is a multinational company that operates in the aerospace, defense, and security sectors. SAFRY has been actively involved in the space industry for over 50 years, developing a range of technologies for rocket propulsion systems, high-performance space optics, and other products.\n\nThe company had a strong performance in 2023, with significant increases in revenue and operating profit. The company\u2019s full-year recurring operating income rose by 31% to \u20ac3.1 billion, while revenue increased by 22% to \u20ac23.1 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the brand has also partnered with Terran Orbital to explore the joint production of satellite propulsion systems in the United States. This collaboration aims to produce electric propulsion systems for satellites based on Safran\u2019s PPSX00 plasma thruster technology.\r\n\r\nOn a high level, the partnership seeks to establish a new U.S.-based production line for electric propulsion systems, which offers advantages such as significant weight savings over conventional chemical propulsion.\n\nThe brand\u2019s solution could be a game changer, which makes it one of those space stocks to buy.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.\n\nSource: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a global security and aerospace company. Now might be a good time to invest in LMT due to the recent reconstruction of its space business to better align with emerging market demands.\n\nOne of the notable projects Lockheed Martin is working on is the production of 42 satellites for the Space Development Agency\u2019s (SDA) Transport Layer Tranche 1, which is a $700 million dollar contract. This initiative is part of a broader effort to create a mesh network of small, cost-effective satellites in low Earth orbit to support U.S. military operations.\n\nIn 2022, Lockheed Martin reported sales of $66 billion, with its space business backlog nearing $30 billion. With an EBITDA margin of around 50% over the past few years, I believe that as this backlog gets cleared, a substantial new amount of earnings and revenue will be unlocked for the firm, which would increase its enterprise value and, consequently, its stock price as well.\n\nAs a highly diversified company with strong interests in aerospace and defense, LMT is one of those companies that many investors should have on their watch lists.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Dividend-Paying Defense Stocks Worth a Look",
        "content": "In today's scorching hot stock market, investors may gloss over the favorable qualities of the defense industry.\n\nDefense companies aren't known for their growth. But they benefit from having a reliable buyer in the U.S. government, which provides predictable cash flows that support organic growth, dividend payments, and often, stock repurchases.\n\nHere's why RTX(NYSE: RTX), Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT), and Honeywell International(NASDAQ: HON) stand out as three defense stocks worth a look. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRTX's mix of revenue streams will attract investors\n\nLee Samaha(RTX): The aerospace and defense industry had a difficult 2023. Defense businesses came under sustained margin pressure as ongoing supply chain issues negatively impacted operations. Meanwhile, the discovery of potential contamination in powder coating used to manufacture turbine discs in RTX's engines used in commercial aerospace (not least the Airbus A320 neo family) will ultimately result in multibillion-dollar hits to earnings and free cash flow (FCF) over the next few years as engines need to be removed and inspected.\n\nStill, there's a value case to be made for the stock. Its aerospace end market remains in growth mode. While the powder coating issue is a disappointment, there's only one other competitor engine on the Airbus A320 neo family, namely the LEAP engine of CFM International (a General Electric joint venture), but that already has a multiyear backlog in place.\n\nMeanwhile, at some point, the supply chain issues dogging the defense industry will abate, creating the possibility for margin headwinds to turn into tailwinds. In addition, there's no shortage of geopolitical tension right now and pressure on NATO countries to ramp up spending or at least replenish equipment used in conflict theaters.\n\nAs such, RTX operates in two end markets that are likely to be in growth mode over the near to medium term. RTX and its dividend face challenges, but are worth a look given the two sectors in which the company operates.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin is a stalwart defense contractor that generates robust free cash flow\n\nScott Levine (Lockheed Martin): Lockheed Martin stock currently provides income investors with a 3% forward-yielding dividend. And with its strong backlog and prodigious free-cash-flow generation, Lockheed Martin seems well suited to continue rewarding shareholders with its generous dividend in the coming years.\n\nAlthough lower sales and higher costs related to the company's F-35 fighter jet adversely affected the top and bottom lines last quarter, Lockheed Martin recently celebrated an otherwise strong end to 2023. Driven by the strong performance of its space segment, Lockheed Martin recognized a 2.4% year-over-year increase in sales and a 21% year-over-year increase in net earnings. The growth carried over to the cash-flow statement as well, where Lockheed Martin reported 2023 free cash flow of $6.23 billion, representing a 1.6% increase over 2022.\n\nHowever, for those looking to fortify their portfolios with a leading defense stock like Lockheed Martin, confidence that the future remains bright is equally important. Thanks to the company's robust backlog, this certainly seems to be the case. Lockheed Martin reported a company record $160.6 billion in backlog at the end of 2023 -- an auspicious sign that the company will be able to grow the dividend.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Lockheed Martin has averaged a payout ratio of 54%. And that's not the only indication that the company can sustain the dividend. LMT Dividend Per Share (Annual) Chart\n\nThe company consistently generates strong free cash flow that it can use to fund the dividend.\n\nWith geopolitical tensions showing little sign of abating anytime soon, Lockheed Martin's business will remain in high demand, making it a worthy addition to income investors' portfolios.\n\nHoneywell has finally found its footing\n\nDaniel Foelber (Honeywell): Honeywell isn't a pure-play defense stock in the same way that RTX and Lockheed Martin are. But that could work in investors' favor.\n\nHoneywell's largest segment is aerospace, but it makes up just 37.2% of sales. Honeywell's other business units are building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.\n\nHoneywell's greatest strength is that it operates a high-margin, diversified business where no single segment makes up too great of a share of sales or profit.\n\nEarlier this month, Honeywell reported overall solid 2023 results. But the real standout was its 2024 guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $9.80 to $10.10, which would be up 7% to 10%. Honeywell's 2024 guidance also calls for organic growth of 4% to 6%, which is in line with the company's long-term target for 4% to 7% organic growth.\n\nFree cash flow is forecast to be $5.6 billion to $6 billion in 2024 -- more than enough to fund the company's dividend with cash. For context, Honeywell spent $8.3 billion in 2023 on dividends, stock buybacks, capital expenditures, and mergers and acquisitions. But the dividend payment only cost Honeywell $2.72 billion -- meaning it is expecting this year's FCF to be more than double the dividend obligation.\n\nIt's been a bumpy ride for Honeywell investors since the onset of the pandemic. As you can see in the following chart, Honeywell has slowly been building up its profits to return to the pre-pandemic high. Sales are down by quite a bit, but Honeywell has made up for that by improving its margins, which has made the business leaner and more efficient overall. HON Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite the good results, Honeywell remains in \"prove it\" mode. It needs to sustain at least mid-single-digit organic growth and high-single-digit or low-double-digit growth once factoring in strategic mergers and acquisitions and buybacks. It also needs to show meaningful results from monetizing the Industrial Internet of Things and artificial intelligence -- themes that Honeywell has been touting for years with unclear material impacts on the bottom line.\n\nThe good news is the stock isn't expensive, sporting just a 23.5 price-to-earnings ratio. It also has a dividend yield of 2.2% as of this writing.\n\nHoneywell is a good choice for investors who want exposure to the defense industry but with the benefit of a diversified industrial conglomerate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in RTX right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in RTX, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and RTX wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 75%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Lockheed Martin implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 8 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lockheed Martin, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lockheed Martin. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lockheed Martin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Lockheed Martin is not owned by hedge funds. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. Lockheed Martin Corporation, ESOP is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 9.1% of the company stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe also observed that the top 8 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that Lockheed Martin Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$49m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Lockheed Martin. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with Lockheed Martin .\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the10 Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024.\n\nAs if anticipation of rate cuts, the Fed's battle against inflation and keeping up with AI-fueled rally in stocks wasn\u2019t enough for investors, the upcoming election-related anxieties are starting to make the financial markets jittery. There are a number of credible reports out there that discuss the behavior of financial markets during US election years. For example, a Morgan Stanley report analyzed some data to see how the S&P 500 performs during election years. This analysis shows that during presidential election years from 1928 through 2016, the stock market has seen more positive performance than negative. The report also said the election of a Republican president resulted in average gains of 15.3% for the S&P 500, compared to a 7.6% gain when a Democrat president comes in the White House.\n\nA 2020 report by T. Rowe Price analyzed historical data on the connection between US elections and the stock market and found some interesting patterns. For example, the report said if the stock market performance is strong ahead of elections in the US, data shows that chances of the incumbent party staying in power increase. On the other hand, when the stock market is soft heading into elections, incumbent party often loses. But does that mean President Joe Biden could notch a second term if the Fed begins to cut rates in the summer and stocks keep gaining ahead of the election? That would be wrong conclusion to deduce from this pattern as the T. Rowe report shed light on a plethora of factors that affect the relationship between the stock market performance and election results. The report also said historical data shows if the incumbent party loses an election, a recession year follows:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Conventional wisdom argues that stock markets tend to perform poorly ahead of elections. Since 70% of the years when the incumbent party lost were followed by a recession year, it makes sense that equity markets performed poorly in the wake of the elections when the incumbent party lost.\"\n\nIf you were to ask an average American today about the hottest issues that would be the point of focus in the US election this year, chances are that their answer would be inflation. But we are still months away from the election and a lot could change. Morgan Stanley analyst Michael D. Zezas recently said in a report that in 2008 expectations were that the elections would move around the US foreign policy. But the financial crisis changed everything. Similarly, presidential candidates in the US election 2020 focused their energies on healthcare and pandemic. Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024\n\nPhoto by History in HD on UnsplashMethodology For this article we went through multiple research reports and analyses of experts who took a look at what stocks and sectors usually benefit during election years. We picked 10 stocks which analysts are specifically recommending investors in 2024 because of election-related catalysts. Some top names include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and\u00a0 Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE).\n\n10. Sempra (NYSE:SRE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nGoldman Sachs in its November 2023 report highlighting election 2024 stocks named Sempra (NYSE:SRE), the California-based utility company which has a dividend yield of about 3.38%. Goldman Sachs analyst Carly Davenport said the following about Sempra (NYSE:SRE):\n\n\u201cThis quarter increased our conviction that Sempra (NYSE:SRE)\u2019s Texas utility Oncor is a material strength for the company. The reduction of regulatory lag, potential increase in capex, and a clear runway for organic load growth in the region all highlight why we have viewed Oncor as an underappreciated asset for Sempra (NYSE:SRE). We believe SRE has several key catalysts ahead, including the aforementioned capex raise, the conclusion of the California GRC (general rate case), and the announcement of FID for the Cameron expansion and Port Arthur Phase 2 in 2024. Sempra (NYSE:SRE) continues to trade at a 0.7x discount to our coverage group on our 2025 numbers, which we view as unwarranted given these strengths.\"\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Sempra (NYSE:SRE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur two utilities\u00a0Sempra (NYSE:SRE) and Edison International were also negatively impacted by rising rates, although both outperformed the utility benchmark. We maintain a large active overweight to Sempra and added opportunistically to Edison to reflect its strong fundamentals.\u201d\n\n9. Fox Corp Class B (NASDAQ:FOX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nFox Corp Class B (NASDAQ:FOX) will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the huge political ad spending in the US ahead of the 2024 elections. A latest Reuters report cited data from Insider Intelligence which said political ads spending in 2024 will be 30% more than 2020. The data said a whopping 71.9% of this total spending will be funneled to TV.\n\nEarlier this month Fox Corp Class B (NASDAQ:FOX)\u00a0posted fiscal second quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.34, beating estimates by $0.22. Revenue in the period fell 8.2% year over year to $4.23 billion, beating estimates by $20 million.\n\nFox Corp Class B (NASDAQ:FOX) management talked about its expectations regarding political ads revenue and other important updates during the earnings call earlier this month:\n\n\"We have an impact from preemptions with election and unfortunately with war coverage. So the preemptions are affecting and ratings are continuing to improve. So we\u2019re happy with where we are at Fox News as all those trends are improving steadily. Local stations is probably the most mixed. But you have a bad comparison, particularly in the current pacings with Super Bowl comps this time last year. It\u2019s probably about $50 million in Super Bowl revenue, just in the station group this time last year.\n\nSo the comparisons are quite tough as we go forward, but we remain confident that we\u2019ll see a record political cycle. This is slightly ameliorated, I think in the current quarter with the lack of a competitive primary competition, but we\u2019re already seeing business in the first half of next year start to flow in from a political perspective. And it\u2019s \u2014 obviously, it\u2019s sort of natural because our stations, we have large number of stations in key political markets like Georgia and Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin. So we\u2019re very confident in a very strong political cycle once that really starts to flow. And then finally with Tubi. Tubi\u2019s TBT is continued to grow, I think at 62%, 63%. And obviously with the TBT growth, the revenue is following, the revenue growth is slightly less or somewhat less than it was last year.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 48\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\u00a0was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the huge infrastructure spending plans initiated by the Biden administration. Goldman Sachs believes if the Republicans come into power, infrastructure stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\u00a0will continue to grow as the new government will begin constructions on borders to stop illegal immigrants.\n\nEarlier this month, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted profit jumped 35% from a year earlier to $5.23 a share, surpassing estimates of a $4.75 per share profit.\n\nIn addition to Caterpillar, hedge funds are also buying JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and\u00a0 Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, also performed well this quarter. Caterpillar has managed to leverage increased capital investment from various end markets, contributing to better than expected fiscal results for Q2. The company is poised to be one of the largest beneficiaries of several government funding initiatives, including the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) bill, CHIPS Act and infrastructure bill. These measures are expected to support construction spending for several years, providing a robust backdrop for Caterpillar\u2019s continued growth.\u201d\n\n7. MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC Common Stock (NASDAQ:MDLZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 51\n\nIn November 2023 Goldman Sachs published a report discussing the US election and its possible impact on the stock market. Goldman Sachs mentioned a couple of stocks it believes were poised to gain strength during the election years. MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC Common Stock (NASDAQ:MDLZ) was one of these stocks. Goldman Sachs said consumer defensive is one of the sectors that perform well during election years.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Jason English praised MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC Common Stock's (NASDAQ:MDLZ) spending in commercial and business expansion in other countries. The analyst set an $82 price target on the stock with a Buy rating.\n\n6. Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 58\n\nDefense stocks will remain in the spotlight amid growing security concerns and a volatile geopolitical situation. The conflict in the Middle East and raging war in Ukraine will keep forcing the US to up its defense spending no matter the outcome of the Presidential Election in 2024.\n\nA latest report by Reuters recently said that Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT)\u00a0plans to boost output of weapons systems to meet greater demand amid growing worries about security. The report said Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT)\u00a0plans to double its production of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS).\n\nIn addition to Lockheed, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and\u00a0 Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) can also gain this year according to analysts.\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT): LMT is the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense contractor. With about 70% of its $66 billion in revenue from the U.S. government, the company is well positioned to benefit from U.S. defense budget growth, historically 5%-6% per year, as well as increased global military spending. With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, a 2.9% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from more than $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns. We re-initiated a small position in August.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Battery Stocks To Buy Before They Take Off 12 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now 14 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a010 Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best buy-the-dip stocks. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market performance, head over to 5 Best Buy-the-Dip Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nIn June 2022, year-over-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.1%. However, throughout most of 2023, stabilized prices were observed due to elevated interest rates and declining energy prices. Despite a slowing rate of increase, the latest CPI reading remains somewhat discouraging for investors who anticipated a continuous decline in inflation with the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy measures. The most recent report from the Labor Department indicates that in January, the CPI rose 3.1% year-over-year, a decrease from December's 3.4% gain but higher than the expected 2.9% increase. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.3%, surpassing economists' estimates of a 0.2% gain.\n\nThe current US inflation and the possibility of a more lenient Federal Reserve policy are sparking discussions about a mild economic slowdown instead of a recession, a severe economic downturn, or a bear market, according to JPMorgan. Leading indicators suggest a deceleration in growth rather than a sudden collapse. Some indicators, such as real estate, corporate, and household delinquency rates, are on the rise, but history shows that these usually trail behind other signals for investors. Essentially, equity markets typically hit their lowest points well before the peak of economic turmoil, with the dot-com cycle being a notable exception. While there is still risk of a recession in 2025, it is important to note that even if it occurs, it is likely to be mild, especially with the Federal Reserve offering significant indirect liquidity to the banking system. JPMorgan acknowledged that investors face challenges, including the impact on public sector finances due to large deficits, markets that have already factored in a very gradual economic slowdown, and the significant influence of mega-cap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings remained stagnant. However, they surged by 33% for the top 7 mega-cap stocks and declined by 5% for the rest of the S&P 500. Taking everything into account, 2024 seems poised for a year of decelerating GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth, and single-digit returns for the average S&P 500 stock, per the bank\u2019s report.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn February 18, Goldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 5,200, indicating a potential 4% increase from its current levels. This adjustment is attributed to a more positive earnings outlook for the companies within the index. Previously, Goldman Sachs had anticipated the index reaching 5,100 by the end of 2024. This initial projection was then revised from 4,700 in December, driven by factors such as moderating inflation and the anticipation of the US central bank implementing interest rate reductions throughout the year. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters:\n\n\"We expect strong world GDP growth and a slightly weaker dollar will support EPS, while lower rates and lower oil prices will be a slight drag.\"\n\nIn 2024, Morningstar believes that the focus will shift towards a more fundamental analysis of individual companies and sectors, moving away from the macroeconomic and behavioral factors that influenced the market in recent years. Economic growth was expected to decelerate not only in the fourth quarter of 2023 but the trend will persist throughout the next three quarters, until a resurgence in the third quarter. Expectations include the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts in 2024 and throughout 2025, concluding by 2026. This reduction in the federal funds rate is predicted to bring the 10-year Treasury yield down to a long-term projection of 2.75%, a decline from the current 4%. In terms of GDP growth, short-term forecasts align closely with consensus, but over a five-year horizon, Morningstar expects a cumulative 3% higher real GDP growth compared to consensus. This is primarily attributed to perspectives on the supply side, involving labor force expansion and productivity growth. Inflation has significantly receded, and by the second quarter of 2024, a return to the Federal Reserve's 2% target is forecasted.\n\nAmid this market backdrop, some investors prefer to buy stocks that are trading near 52-week lows to reap the benefits later. Some of the best 52-week low stocks include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).\n\nOurMethodology\n\nFor this article, we used a stock screener to identify stocks that are trading near or at their 52-week lows. Then, we chose different industry filters, picking 13 companies stocks from popular industries with the highest number of hedge fund investors in the fourth quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nBest Buy-the-Dip Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n13. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53\n\nIndustry: Gold\n\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) focuses on the production and exploration of gold, as well as the exploration of copper, silver, zinc, and lead. It has operations and assets in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and Ghana. On October 26, 2023, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.36. The revenue declined 5% compared to the prior-year quarter, coming in at $2.5 billion.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 53 hedge funds were bullish on Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard\u2019s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 23.75 million shares worth $983.2 million.\n\nLike Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is one of the best 52-week low stocks to buy.\n\nHere is what First Eagle Investments Global Fund has to say about Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cShares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.\n\nIt also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance. We remain constructive on the stock, which offers steady production anchored in good jurisdictions, a good pipeline of organic projects, a strong balance sheet, and proven management.\u201d\n\n12. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\n\nIndustry: Farm & Heavy Construction Machinery\n\nDeere & Company (NYSE:DE) is a global manufacturer and distributor of farming equipment, operating through four segments \u2013 Production and Precision Agriculture, Small Agriculture and Turf, Construction and Forestry, and Financial Services. On February 15, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company\u2019s GAAP EPS and revenue came in at $6.23 and $12.19 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by $1.02 and $1.86 billion, respectively. It is one of the best 52-week low stocks to consider.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 54 hedge funds were long Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), compared to 55 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.5 million shares worth $1.4 billion.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur industrials holdings produced robust absolute returns for the quarter. While the ISM Manufacturing Index fell in November to contractionary levels, our industrial holdings have largely been able to maintain earnings due to strong competitive positions, historically large backlogs and company-specific drivers. For example, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) continues to benefit from a strong upgrade cycle as record farmers\u2019 income is driving broad and rapid adoption of the company\u2019s precision agricultural equipment.\u201d\n\n11. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nIndustry: Entertainment\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is a global media and entertainment company operating in three segments \u2013 Studios, Network, and DTC. The company ranks 11th on our list of the best 52-week low stocks. On November 8, 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) reported a Q3 GAAP EPS of -$0.17, missing market consensus by $0.08. The revenue increased 1.5% year-over-year to $9.97 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $10 million. The global direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscriber count declined by 0.7 million, reaching 95.1 million at the conclusion of Q3, compared to 95.8 million subscribers at the close of Q2.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nLongleaf Partners Fund stated the following regarding Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe rules have improved how we analyze existing holdings and influenced the price at which we will buy a new holding and/or trim or add to an existing one. This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again. However, even with the new rule lens, we remain confident in our case for the business and management\u2019s ability to deliver going forward.\u201d\n\n10. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nIndustry: Aerospace and Defense\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a global security and aerospace company specializing in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of technology systems, products, and services. It is one of the top 52-week low stocks to invest in. On February 15, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it is responding to heightened security concerns by increasing the production of weapons systems. The company plans to double the production of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) from 48 to 96 per year. Production of the Javelin antitank missile system is set to increase from 2,400 to an estimated 3,960 per year by late 2026. Lockheed is on track to deliver over 10,000 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) this year and aims to increase output to 14,000 per year by 2025. Additionally, the company intends to boost production of the PAC-3 MSE air-defense missile to 650 per year by 2027.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), compared to 60 funds in the preceding quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel\u2019s Two Sigma Advisors is the biggest investor in the company, with 772,600 shares worth over $350 million.\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT): LMT is the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense contractor. With about 70% of its $66 billion in revenue from the U.S. government, the company is well positioned to benefit from U.S. defense budget growth, historically 5%-6% per year, as well as increased global military spending. With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, a 2.9% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from more than $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns. We re-initiated a small position in August.\u201d\n\n9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 59\n\nIndustry: Food and Beverages\n\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) ranks 9th on our list of the best 52-week low stocks to buy. On January 30, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) adjusted its full-year revenue growth guidance, now expecting a range of +7% to +10%, compared to the earlier projection at the lower end of +10% to +12%. The forecast for full-year global and US comparable sales growth has been revised to a range of 4% to 6%, down from the previous estimate of +5% to +7%. Despite these adjustments, the company has maintained its prior guidance for earnings per share growth and global store growth.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), compared to 60 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 11.3 million shares worth over $1 billion.\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX): SBUX is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 83 markets. Through its more than 36,000 global stores (roughly 50% operated and 50% licensed) the company offers handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of food items. SBUX also sells a variety of packaged coffee and tea products and licenses its trademarks through other channels such as grocery and foodservice through a Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9. In addition to its flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, the company sells goods and services under the brands Teavana, Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi.\n\nSBUX\u2019s recently appointed CEO (March 2023), Narasimhan Laxman, reiterated the company\u2019s long-term plans for 10-12% revenue growth and 15-20% EPS growth while reporting fiscal 3Q23 earnings. Revenue will be driven by a combination of factors including unit growth, higher food \u201cattach\u201d rates (more food sold per cup of coffee), equipment innovation to speed throughput, and delivery expansion. In addition to the leverage of higher revenue across the company\u2019s fixed asset base, SBUX sees margin expansion from supply chain management opportunities and procurement efficiencies. We initiated a small position in August.\u201d\n\n8. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nIndustry: Communication Equipment\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) engages in the design, production, and sale of networking products related to the communications and information technology sector.

(NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 funds in the prior quarter.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.\u201d\n\n7. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nIndustry: Medical Devices\n\nBecton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) specializes in the development, manufacturing, and sale of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment, and diagnostic products worldwide. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) is one of the best buy-the-dip stocks to monitor. On January 23, the company declared a $0.95 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on March 29, to shareholders of record on March 8.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter.

Revenue guidance was in-line, but earnings guidance was below expectations driven by lower operating margins. The lower operating margin is a result of currency and inventory reduction headwinds.\u201d\n\n6. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nIndustry: Conglomerates\n\n3M Company (NYSE:MMM) delivers a range of diverse technology services globally.

        "title": "Why Is Lockheed (LMT) Down 1% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Lockheed Martin (LMT). Shares have lost about 1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Lockheed due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nLockheed Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Sales Decline Y/Y\n\nLockheed Martin reported fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $7.90 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 by 8.8%. The bottom line also improved 1.4% from the year-ago quarter's recorded figure.\n\nThe company reported GAAP earnings of $7.58 per share compared with $7.40 in the prior-year period.\n\nLockheed reported 2023 adjusted earnings of $27.82 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.24 by 2.1%. The bottom line also rose 2.2% from the year-ago quarter's recorded figure.\n\nOperational Highlights\n\nNet sales were $18.87 billion in the reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.98 billion by 4.9%. The top line, however, decreased 0.6% from $18.99 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNet sales were $67.57 billion in 2023, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.68 billion by 1.3%. The top line also rose 2.4% from $65.98 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nBacklog\n\nLockheed\u2019s backlog as of Dec 31, 2023, was $160.57 billion compared with $156.03 billion at the end of third-quarter 2023.\n\nOur model projected a backlog worth $169.08 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Aeronautics segment accounted for $60.16 billion of this amount, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $37.73 billion. The Missiles and Fire Control, and the Space Systems segments contributed $32.23 billion and $30.46 billion, respectively.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nAeronautics: Sales decreased 0.3% year over year to $7.61 billion on account of lower sales from the F-35 program due to lower volume from production contracts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit deteriorated 6.7% year over year to $761 million. The operating margin also contracted 70 basis points (bps) to 10%.\n\nMissiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales dropped 3.5% year over year to $3.17 billion. This was on account of lower net sales from integrated air and missile defense programs, primarily due to supplier cost timing on PAC-3 missiles.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit decreased 12.4% year over year to $395 million, while the operating margin of 12.5% deteriorated 120 bps from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nSpace Systems: Sales increased 3.5% year over year to $3.38 billion due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, driven by a ramp-up in the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) development program.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit improved 31.2% to $307 million. The operating margin expanded 190 bps to 9.2% in the quarter under review.\n\nRotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly revenues declined 2% to $4.71 billion on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by lower sales from integrated warfare systems and sensors programs as well as from training and logistics solutions programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 2% to $579 million in the reported quarter. The operating margin expanded 50 bps to 12.3% in the same time frame.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nLockheed\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.44 billion at the end of 2023 compared with $2.55 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nCash from operating activities amounted to $7.92 billion during 2023 compared with $7.80 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nLong-term debt as of Dec 31, 2023, totaled $17.29 billion, up from $15.43 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nLockheed has provided its financial guidance for 2024. The company expects revenues in the range of $68.50-$70.00 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $68.59 billion, which lies lower than the mid-point of the company\u2019s guided range.\n\nLMT expects to generate earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $25.65-$26.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s full-year EPS is pinned at $26.70, higher than the company\u2019s guided range.\n\nLockheed expects to generate free cash flow in the range of $6.00-$6.30 billion during 2024.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Lockheed has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Lockheed has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we look at 10 countries with the most military drones in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on the technological advancements in this segment of military warfare and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World.\n\nThe wars between Azerbaijan and Armenia first in 2020, and then later involving Russia and Ukraine have been the kind of conflicts that western powers had been worrying about, and are now scrambling to prepare themselves for a future that already seems to be here. Demand for military drones have surged over the last few years with countries actively using their unmanned aerial vehicles for intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, and target operations.\n\nDrones were a prominent feature of the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and have been clouding the skies in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Borodyanka among other towns and cities in Ukraine, in what is being seen as the arrival of a new threat in the aerial defense space. These uninhabited aerial vehicles have made it difficult for enemy targets to move and hide on the battlefield with their aerial footages offering unprecedented birds-eye views of the war.\n\nThe Americans have been operating drones for about a century now, having deployed them first during World War II, between 1939 and 1945, and then more recently in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq. Defense experts believe the proliferation of military drones is a concern for US policymakers who worry about China taking a leaf out of Russia\u2019s book (strikes on Ukraine), and launching similar attacks against US interests in the Pacific. Moreover, US troops have also come under drone attacks from non-state actors in the Middle East in recent years \u2013 most notably from ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nConsidering the rapidly evolving threat, the Americans are taking initiatives to stay a step ahead of their foes. In August 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced to build \u2018attritable autonomous systems\u2019 in mass over the next two years. Moreover, under the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, the US Air Force plans to develop drone wingmen to fly alongside its premier fighter and bomber jets \u2013 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-35 and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)\u2019s B-21 Raider.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese unmanned combat air vehicles will be used to perform several missions, such as surveillance, striking enemies and jamming their signals. The Air Force expects about a thousand CCAs to enter service by 2028, which will mean that they would be ready for deployment with the sixth-generation of fighter jets that are currently being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program.\n\nAccording to a report, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and General Atomics, are all vying for contracts for the classified CCA initiative. All of these companies have played a significant role in the development of the United States\u2019 current fleet of drones.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is the manufacturer of the RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4 Triton and the RQ-180 fleets of drones operated by the US military. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s RQ-170 Sentinel was introduced in 2007, and is operated by the Air Force for CIA missions. On the other hand, the MQ-9 Reaper built by General Atomics is one of the most potent drones operated by the US, and serves as the primary offensive strike uninhabited aerial vehicle of the Air Force.\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is currently overseeing the development of the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which will become the first unmanned aerial refueling vehicle that will be carrier-based and will extend the range of the US Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received a $805 million contract in 2018 for four MQ-25 Stingrays to be delivered by August 2024.\n\nAnother prominent defense contractor that builds unmanned aerial vehicles in the US is AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV). It is the manufacturer of the RQ-11B Raven, a small drone, that is the most widely used unmanned aerial vehicle in the world, with more than 19,000 units produced. While originally designed for the US military, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)\u2019s RQ-11B Raven are used by air forces of several other countries as well now \u2013 including the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Pakistan. According to figures released by The Center of the Study of the Drone at Bard College in 2020, about 60% of the American drone fleet comprises RQ-11B Raven.\n\nRecently, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) reported a revenue of $180.8 million in its second quarter results for the fiscal year 2024 \u2013 up 62% year-to-year. Wahid Nawabi, the Chairman, President and CEO of the company shared the following remarks in AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)\u2019s Q2 2024 Earnings Call on December 5, 2023:\n\nWe\u2019re very pleased with our performance through the first half of this fiscal year, which included significant topline revenue acceleration and record EBITDA. We remain optimistic about our future exemplified by higher growth, improving operating results and enhanced value creation for our shareholders. As we said last quarter, this reflects not only near-term demand dynamics related to global complexity but also a long-term shift in military strategy to the more frequent use of intelligent multi-domain Unmanned Systems which are either use, highly effective and provide a compelling value proposition. Our differentiated portfolio offers the greatest breadth and depth of unmanned solutions to meet the growing demands of our country and allies.\n\nWe are an industry leader in contested environments as well as AI-enabled autonomous operations and governments around the globe are witnessing these unmatched capabilities effectively perform on real and highly contested battlefields. As a testament to the incredible effectiveness of our innovative solutions, we now have nine different unmanned platforms deployed in Ukraine, all receiving high levels of praise. We could not be prouder and more honored of how our solutions and team members are helping our customers successfully achieve their vital missions. 10 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nCountries with the most military drones in the world are ranked in ascending order of their fleet size of drones. Data has been sourced from Power Atlas, a joint publication of the European Council of Foreign Relations and Stiftung Mercator, released in December 2021; and The Drone Databook published by The Center of the Study of the Drone at Bard College in March 2020.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 15 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Satellites in Orbit.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Finland\n\nDrones: 412\n\nMore than half of Finland\u2019s large fleet of military drones consist of Orbiter 2-B manufactured by Israel\u2019s Aeronautics Defense Systems. These are lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles that are designed for military and security purposes, and are integrated into all eight brigade-level formations of the Finnish Army. Another potent aerial vehicle operated by Finland is Ranger, which was built as part of a joint venture between Switzerland\u2019s RUAG Aviation and Israel Aerospace Industries.\n\n9. South Korea\n\nDrones: 518\n\nSouth Korea is among countries with the most military drones in the world, with a sizable fleet of 514 unmanned aerial vehicles that are used for surveillance, reconnaissance, and intelligence gathering missions. Majority of the drones that are currently in operation of the South Korean military are locally produced, while some were acquired from foreign countries \u2013 including four RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV from the United States. These are manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).\n\n8. Australia\n\nDrones: 557\n\nAustralia has a fleet of 557 drones used for military purposes, according to Power Atlas and The Drone Databook. These include 161 PD-100 Black Hornet and 350 Phantom, which are unarmed but used for military needs such as battle planning, surveillance, and intelligence gathering. The Australian Air Force also possesses between 12-16 MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles manufactured by General Atomics. Moreover, there are six MQ-4C Triton drones that are in use by the country\u2019s Navy.\n\n7. France\n\nDrones: 591\n\nFrance is one of the countries with the most military drones in the world. Its fleet of uninhabited aerial vehicles include 210 mini Spy\u2019Ranger UAVs developed by Thales, 11 Safran Patroller aircraft made by Sagem, and 12 MQ-9 Reaper drones it procured from the United States. According to The Center of the Study of the Drone at Bard College, France\u2019s Syst\u00e8me de Drones A\u00e9rien de la Marine (SDAM) program is working to develop an unmanned rotorcraft for frigates operated by the French Navy.\n\n6. India\n\nDrones: 625\n\nNext up on sixth spot is India, which has a sizable fleet of 625 drones, at least. These include 600 Spylite, which were introduced in 2019, according to The Drone Databook. In addition to this, the country procured 10 Heron 1 drones from Israel for a deal worth $400 million in 2015. India also operates 15 Harop unmanned aircraft. All of the drones operated by India are of Israeli-origin. It is among countries with the most military drones in the world.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World 15 Countries with the Most Battle Tanks in the World 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Bryce Walters, a 26-year-old manufacturing robotics engineer for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire control, joined the latest episode of the Gen Z in Manufacturing podcast to discuss his experience in the industry.\n\n\"Gen Z in Manufacturing\" explores the perspectives of young professionals in the manufacturing industry and delves into their experiences, career growth and what attracts them to their respective companies.\n\nMost Read on IEN:\n\nAuto Workers Threaten to Strike Again at Ford's Huge Kentucky Truck Plant U.S. Army Scrapping Helicopter Program After Spending Billions Stranded Space Factory Finally Gets OK to Return to Earth Authorities Take Down Hackers That Targeted Manufacturers with Ransomware Attacks\n\nWalters\u2019 interest in manufacturing began as he grew up with an engineer mother and an air traffic controller father. His first job in the industry was an internship with Indiana Precision Grinding, and during his sophomore year at Purdue University, he had the option to intern with a heavy equipment manufacturer near school or with Lockheed Martin MFC in Orlando. He decided to go with Lockheed Martin, and after graduating in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering technology, he returned to the aerospace company where he currently designs, integrates and sustains automated systems.\n\nWalters was also recently recognized by SME as one of the 2023 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d honorees.\n\nA common characteristic of the Gen Z workforce is searching for meaning in their careers. Walters explained that Lockheed Martin provided this sense of purpose through the company's global implications.\n\n\"Since the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel have risen, both conflicts are using material that we manufacture,\" Walters said. \"It's definitely something that you look at and realize, 'The stuff I make matters to people.' Working at Lockheed Martin, it's, 'Wow, that interceptor missile that we made kept these innocent people from dying.' That's amazing that I had the opportunity to do something like that.\"\n\nAlso in the episode, Walters discusses Gen Z's holistic approach to work and personal life, the optimal way for manufacturers to run internships and internship tendencies that need to change.\n\nTo watch all episodes of the Gen Z in Manufacturing podcast, visit manufacturing.net.

        "title": "Red Sea ballistic missile attacks trigger Asian interest in defences",
        "content": "By Gerry Doyle\n\nSINGAPORE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The use of anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) in the Red Sea has spurred interest in Asia about the systems used to shoot them down, experts and industry officials say - although China, with its huge ASBM arsenal, presents a tougher challenge.\n\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) media releases from Nov. 27 - the world's first documented use of an ASBM in combat - to Feb. 20 mention a total of 48 ASBMs and 12 interceptions in the Red Sea. Those releases noted that many ASBMs fired by the Iran-aligned Yemeni Houthis posed no danger and were not engaged.\n\nOn the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow this week, a senior executive at a U.S. defence contractor said the air defence activity in the Red Sea and in Ukraine had caught the attention of potential customers in Asia.\n\n\"What we're seeing is demand increase for integrated air and missile defence here,\" said the executive, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. He said that included sensors to detect targets, the weapons to shoot them down and the command-and-control systems tying it all together.\n\nRobert Hewson of Sweden's Saab said at the air show that customers in Asia were now more interested in not just countering ballistic missiles, but also small, \"low-end\" aerial threats such as drones that have been launched in concert with larger attacks in the Red Sea.\n\n\"It turns out we can do this ballistic missile stuff,\" Hewson said. \"It costs a lot of money and shoots big expensive missiles, but it looks like it all works. What we're not really able to do reliably is handle swarms of small threats that are coming at us ... at the same time.\"\n\nCENTCOM said it did not have a complete tally of ASBMs fired, interceptions and interception attempts for public release. A U.S. defence official said whenever ASBMs were in range of a Navy ship, they were engaged.\n\nU.S. Navy destroyers are equipped with the Aegis air defence system, with components from Lockheed Martin, among others, which is designed to shoot down aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAegis uses RTX subsidiary Raytheon's SM-2, SM-3 and SM-6 missiles to intercept threats. A Raytheon spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had seen increased interest in missile defence systems since the Houthi attacks began. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson provided public information about increased production of certain systems.\n\nA spokesperson for European defence conglomerate MBDA noted at the air show that the British government had awarded it a 400 million pound ($505 million) contract in January to upgrade its Sea Viper air defence system to handle ballistic missiles.\n\nA missile defence program director with direct knowledge of the Aegis system said a key takeaway from that conflict was missile defence ships must have \"deep magazines\", carrying enough interceptors to allow multiple shots at each threat.\n\nU.S. Navy Admiral Mark Melson, commander of Logistics Group Western Pacific, said at the air show the military was studying what lessons from the missile engagements could be applied in Asia and elsewhere.\n\n\"In a very competitive shipping environment, where we potentially have a scenario where weapons are getting used as a high rate, clearly, we want to understand what that sustainment challenge looks like,\" he said, speaking about keeping U.S. warships' missile defences supplied.\n\nThe Houthis have said all their missiles are domestically produced. Experts, the U.S. military and the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency say Iran has at least provided assistance, if not weapons themselves.\n\nIn either case, the ASBMs and targeting on display in the Red Sea are rudimentary compared with what China could bring to bear, said Ankit Panda of the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace.\n\n\"The overall system complexity of Chinese ASBMs, including the range to which they aspire, outclasses the missiles we've seen used by the Houthis,\" he said. \"I think both Beijing and Washington would do well to not overinterpret lessons about the viability and limitations of ASBMs from the last few months' experience in the Red Sea.\" ($1 = 0.7920 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Gerry Doyle; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

        "content": "Stocks have\u00a0been defying expectations with the S&P 500 index reaching recent all-time highs. The bullish sentiment is being fueled by expectations of multiple interest rate cuts starting sooner rather than later. Risk-on sentiment is starting to return, and investors are looking for growth stocks to buy.\n\nBut the rally hasn\u2019t been broad-based. It\u2019s more like a game of Whack-a-Mole. Even the Magnificent 7 has been trimmed by one. Investors want to see the rally broaden out before they will believe a full-fledged bull market is underway.\n\nThey may be waiting a little longer. The latest reading of the consumer price index (CPI) hints that inflation may be making a return. And that is dampening hopes for interest rate cuts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut there are some stocks that are ready to report strong earnings even if the Fed stands pat. And those stocks still look undervalued. If these stocks start to run, you\u2019ll know a bull market is underway. Here are seven growth stocks to buy no matter what happens to the broader market.\n\nGenerac Holdings (GNRC) Generac GP7500E 7500-Watt Gasoline during Fundraising Event in Olney, MD\n\nSource: Lissandra Melo / Shutterstock.com\n\nGenerac (NYSE:GNRC) is growing, just not as much as analysts want. That\u2019s my initial takeaway from the company\u2019s earnings report. The company missed analyst\u2019s forecasts on the top and bottom line. Still, the company delivered year-over-year (YOY) gains, reversing a trend from the last few quarters.\n\nAnd the company\u2019s guidance was lighter than expected. Ok, maybe Generac could use some help from the Fed. But either way, it seems that investors are trying to figure out a fair price for the stock. I listed GNRC stock as an undervalued stock in October 2023. It surged higher but quickly moved into overbought range.\n\nThat was just about where the stock was prior to earnings. Again, this is a case of good not being good enough. The company\u2019s gross margin continues to improve and the company still forecasts robust earnings growth in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat growth may be stronger with a little help from the Fed \u2013 or a strong hurricane season that reminds consumers of the base use case for the company\u2019s signature product line. Either scenario would send the stock soaring which is why it should be on a watchlist of growth stocks to buy.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley.

To that end, the company made a number of strategic acquisitions in the last year to help enhance its AI and machine learning capabilities.\n\nThe company\u2019s allows its customers to access its data across numerous public clouds which sets it apart from others in the sector. It\u00a0also helps ensure that the company will continue to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth.\n\nAnalysts still have a consensus rating of Buy on SNOW stock. But the consensus price target is below the current price. But price targets are rising ahead of the company\u2019s earnings report on February 28, 2024. A solid report and guidance would be all that some analysts will need to bid the stock higher.\n\nSea Limited (SE) The logo for Sea Limited is seen on a web browser through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn marketing, companies will frequently talk about the shotgun versus rifle approach to reaching consumers. The rifle approach is a niche approach that targets a company\u2019s products to a specific market, but in a way that will, ideally, help the company capture outsized market share in that market.\n\nThe shotgun approach means that a company has offerings that attempt to cast a wide net. That\u2019s a long \u2013winded way to describe what Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is doing in Latin America and Southeast Asia. The company\u2019s business model includes digital entertainment, e-commerce and digital payments and financial services.\n\nIf that sounds like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), you\u2019d be right. The company is often compared to Amazon. But Sea Limited has much more growth to offer, especially as many Asian markets are starting to reawaken. The company is forecasting earnings to grow by over 85% in the next 12 months and analysts give the stock a consensus Buy rating with a price target that forecasts 27% growth.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock is up a whopping 177% in the last 12 months and 49.9% in 2024. However, most of its recent growth has come after it reported earnings in February. Heading into earnings, analysts were skeptical that Palantir would be able to deliver on lofty expectations of growth with its AI platform, AIP.\n\nThose doubts were more than allayed. Palantir is signing up new customers at a dizzying pace. That\u2019s due, in no small part to the AI bootcamps that the company is conducting.\n\nMidway through 2023, Palantir delivered its first profitable quarter. With this latest report, the company is well on its way to delivering a full-year of positive earnings and expectations for next year are for more of the same.\n\nAnalysts still have a Neutral rating on PLTR stock, but recent price targets are moving noticeably higher. While the stock has dropped after each of its last two earnings reports, it\u2019s moved on to higher highs each time.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is not necessarily a name that comes to mind when you think about growth stocks to buy. However, these aren\u2019t ordinary times. The world is full of geopolitical flashpoints that seemingly could get much worse very quickly.\n\nMetaphorically, the world is on fire. And that sound of fiddles you hear may be coming from the U.S. Congress which seems to be in a state of permanent disfunction. A little gridlock is good, but it would be nice to think Congress could pass a budget. The absence of which is weighing on LMT stock.\n\nThe company is one of the leading defense contractors to the United States. A year ago, it would have seemed laughable that the defense budget would be cut. It still may not get cut, but it\u2019s less of a certainty. Something has to give. But that assumes the political will exists to fix the budget deficit.\n\nInvestors hate uncertainty. Budgets provide certainty. Perhaps the election will provide that.\n\nNewmont (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nSpeaking of out-of-control federal spending, it may be a great time to invest in gold. And if physical gold is not your style, Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) may be more your flavor.\n\nWhatever you feel about gold as an investment, it\u2019s hard to argue with the law of supply and demand. Central banks the world over bought gold at a record pace in 2022. And last year, the amount of gold they purchased was just below that level. There\u2019s no reason to believe they\u2019re done buying.\n\nNewmont is the world\u2019s leading gold mining business, and it has the balance sheet to prove it. In its\u2019 most recent quarter, the company\u2019s operating cash flow came in at $1 billion. That puts the company in a solid position to meet their forecast of a 35% increase in earnings as gold continues to rise.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) ran a Super Bowl ad which had nothing to do with that vaccine. Instead, the 90-second spot looked to remind viewers that Pfizer has played a key role in, among other things, developing cancer treatments.\n\nThat\u2019s a good reason to consider PFE stock. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN). This will more than double Pfizer\u2019s oncology pipeline which was already formidable. It will still take time for these drugs to move through clinical trials, but the company has other candidates in its pipeline, including its own entry into the obesity drug market, that are much closer.\n\nAll of which is to say that PFE stock is undervalued and should be considered one of the growth stocks to buy in 2024. It\u2019s trading near its 52-week low and has a forward P/E ratio of just 12x. Analysts have a Buy rating on the stock as well with a price target of $31.21. And Pfizer pays a solid dividend that the company has increased for the 14 consecutive years and currently yields 6.11%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in PLTR.

        "content": "(Updates headline)\n\nBy Mike Stone\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Desperate to address surging demand for solid fuel rocket engines, the Pentagon is close to giving a contract for new motors to the untested, privately held startup Ursa Major, according to two sources familiar with the situation.\n\nWhile rocket motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, they play a vital role in propelling billions of dollars of missiles and rockets on order to supply the war efforts in Ukraine and Israel, and to re-stock dwindling U.S. inventories.\n\nThe contract - expected to be small and to fall under the Pentagon's development programs - would be a big vote of confidence in the upstart defense contractor as officials seek more suppliers beyond the two dominant rocket engine makers - Northrop Grumman and L3 Harris Technologies. There are other recent entrants including X-Bow Systems.\n\nIt also shows the Defense Department's growing appetite for risk to resolve what officials called a \"major crisis.\"\n\n\"As soon as I get the FY (fiscal year) '24 budget I am going to drop it on a small company that is going to do additive manufacturing of a solid rocket motor,\" Heidi Shyu, under secretary of defense for research and engineering, told Congress last week.\n\nShe did not name of the company or give a size of the contract during her testimony, but did say the company had been working closely with the Navy, adding, \"we can't wait to get them on contract.\"\n\nA congressional aide and an industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said Shyu was referring to Ursa Major, a privately held company that uses 3-D printing to make rocket motors.\n\nA representative of Ursa Major declined to comment. The Pentagon declined further comment on the possible award.\n\nUrsa Major is headquartered in Berthoud, Colorado, and backed by investors including RTX Ventures, BlackRock and Eclipse.\n\nUrsa Major's website features the launch of a Javelin anti-tank missile, a weapon heavily used in Ukraine's efforts to combat the Russian invasion for the last two years. Ursa Major says it can make rocket motors between 2 and 22 inches in diameter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe industry executive from a large defense prime contractor said Ursa Major's motors can be used in any small diameter weapon like the new Boeing and SAAB product the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), RTX's SM-6 rockets and Lockheed Martin's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) which are used heavily in Ukraine.\n\nLockheed Martin was making about 4,600 GMLRS per year but has ramped production since 2022. More than 5,000 have been sent to Ukraine so far, according to a Reuters analysis. GMLRS production is scheduled to ramp from 10,000 deliveries in 2024 to 14,000 deliveries in 2025 as demand surges.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's 2024 budget request was the first to procure missiles and other munitions with multi-year contracts, something that is routine for planes and ships, as the Pentagon signals enduring demand to top munitions makers.\n\nThat 2024 budget, which is still not through Congress, earmarked $11 billion to \"deliver a mix of highly lethal precision weapons\" which included hypersonic prototyping and the multiyear procurements of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASM), and Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and Standard Missile 6 (SM-6).\n\nUrsa Major has raised $274 million from investors and has a valuation of $750 million according to PitchBook data.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Insiders Sell US$9.2m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "content": "The fact that multiple Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$474 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$424. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nInsider Ownership Of Lockheed Martin\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Lockheed Martin insiders own about US$48m worth of shares. That equates to 0.05% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Lockheed Martin shares in the last quarter. Our analysis of Lockheed Martin insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nLarge-cap stocks rose to prominence when the inflation storm began and the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.

Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley said in a report that US stock are pricing in a lot of good news for 2024. Goldman Sachs said valuations are no longer cheap but they are not stretched either. Goldman said in the current environment where cost of capital remains high, large-cap stocks are \"better insulated\" from market pressures when compared to \"fragile\" small-cap companies.\n\nCiti Picks Top Large-Cap Stocks for 2024\n\nIn January 2024, Citi published its large-cap recommendations for 2024. Citi said these are buy-rated large-cap stocks that were selected through a \"bottom-up fundamental methodology.\" Citi said it took into account several metrics while choosing these stocks including health of balance sheets, growth prospects and valuations.\n\nFor this article we scanned through Citi's list of large-cap recommendations and picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS)\u00a0recently posted Q4 results. While GAAP EPS of $1.67 missed estimates, revenue in the period came in at $20.48 billion, beating estimates by $810 million.\n\nClearBridge Dividend Strategy made the following comment about T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter we initiated positions in two new names:\u00a0T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Gilead Sciences. T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile\u2019s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost.

Over the same period, AT&T\u2019s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon\u2019s by less than 5%.\n\nGiven the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion \u2014 providing a 10% yield based on today\u2019s stock price.\n\nWe have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n14 Most Profitable Large Cap Stocks to Buy 17 High Growth Large-Cap Stocks To Invest In 10 Large-Cap Stocks Billionaires Like the Least\n\nDisclosure.

In case you want to skip our detailed analysis on the realm of science in today\u2019s world, and Einstein\u2019s contribution to it, you can go directly to 5 Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More.\n\nIn the realm of intellect and innovation, there existed a luminary whose brilliance transcended the boundaries of time. On April 18, 1955, Albert Einstein departed this world after a blood vessel near his heart ruptured. When offered the option of surgery, Einstein gracefully declined, declaring, \"I choose to depart on my terms. Prolonging life artificially lacks elegance. I have fulfilled my purpose; it is time to bid adieu.\" Following a post-mortem examination, Einstein's remains were cremated, and his ashes scattered in a location undisclosed. The globe mourned the loss of a visionary. In adherence to his wishes, his office and abode remained untouched by the shadow of memorials.\n\nAlbert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, and passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S., was a renowned physicist whose research extended across various fields, from quantum mechanics to theories concerning gravity and motion. Following the publication of several seminal papers, Einstein embarked on a world tour, delivering lectures about his groundbreaking discoveries. In 1921, he was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect. Einstein's most famous equation, E = mc^2, asserts the equivalence of energy and mass, illustrating that they are interchangeable forms of the same entity. His contributions also include the development of the theory of special and general relativity, which built upon and expanded previous theories proposed by Isaac Newton more than two centuries earlier.\n\nThe Enduring Influence of Albert Einstein's Revolutionary Scientific Discoveries in Modern Industries\n\nAlbert Einstein's scientific discoveries continue to resonate and shape various industries in profound ways, even in the modern era.

These qualities, according to Einstein, deserve admiration and respect.\n\n24. \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\"\n\nThis quote on our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More suggests that in order to solve problems effectively, we need to think differently than we did when the problems arose. It highlights the importance of embracing new perspectives, approaches, and ideas to address challenges and create solutions.\n\n23. \"Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation.\"\n\nEinstein expressed what drew him to the world and the universe, shaping his professional journey and achievements.\n\n22. \"Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.\"\n\n21. \"Nature shows us only the tail of the lion. But there is no doubt in my mind that the lion belongs with it even if he cannot reveal himself to the eye all at once because of his huge dimension.\"\n\nOur understanding of nature and the universe remains limited compared to the vastness that exists. Einstein conveys the idea that there is more to discover beyond what is currently known.\n\n20. \"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.\"\n\nThis next quote on our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More emphasizes the idea that by observing and connecting with nature, one can gain profound insights, wisdom, and understanding about the world and life itself. It suggests that nature holds valuable lessons and truths that can enhance our perspective and knowledge.\n\n19. \u201cWhen you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it\u2019s only a minute. But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it\u2019s two hours. That\u2019s relativity.\u201d\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity, conveyed in layman\u2019s terms, reflects his knowledge and brilliance. This quote stands among the best quotes by Albert Einstein.\n\n18. \"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.\"\n\n17. \u201cIt is true that my parents were worried because I began to speak fairly late, so that they even consulted a doctor. I can\u2019t say how old I was \u2014 but surely not less than three.\u201d\n\nOvercoming personal struggles and challenges is what distinguishes the exceptional from the ordinary, although acknowledging survivor\u2019s fallacy.\n\n16. \"Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.\"\n\nNext on our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More implies that while logic is necessary for solving problems and reaching specific goals (from point A to point B), imagination has the unlimited potential to inspire creativity and exploration to take us beyond the confines of what is known or expected, allowing us to envision new possibilities and reach unforeseen destinations.\n\n15. \u201cThe important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day.\u201d\n\nThe best scientists maintain curiosity, allowing them to discover and understand the mysteries of existence.\n\n14. \"Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.\"\n\nThis next quote in our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More humorously remarks that while he acknowledges the infinite nature of the universe, he expresses uncertainty about whether human stupidity has its limits. It highlights a witty observation on the perpetual and seemingly boundless nature of human folly.\n\n13. \u201cAs a human being, one has been endowed with just enough intelligence to be able to see clearly how utterly inadequate that intelligence is when confronted with what exists.\u201d\n\nThe supreme secrets of the universe surpass even the most intelligent minds in their ability to comprehend. This quote is 13th quote on our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More.\n\n12. \"Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning.\"\n\nThis quote on our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More encourages continuous learning from the past, embracing the present, and maintaining hope for the future. It underscores the importance of ongoing curiosity and questioning as essential elements of a fulfilling and meaningful life.\n\n11. \u201cCommon sense is nothing more than a deposit of prejudices laid down in the mind before you reach eighteen.\u201d\n\nChallenging preconceived notions is essential for expanding one\u2019s learning, as common sense often relies on ingrained prejudices.\n\n10. \"The world is not dangerous because of those who do harm but because of those who look at it without doing anything.\"\n\nNow this quote on our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More suggests that the true danger in the world arises not only from those who actively cause harm but also from individuals who witness wrongdoing without taking any action. It underscores the importance of being proactive and standing against injustice to make the world a better place.\n\n9. \u201cMy passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a \u2018lone traveler\u2019 and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of being comfortable with oneself, Einstein embraced solitude despite his strong sense of social justice.\n\n8. \"The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.\"\n\nIn this quote, Albert Einstein expresses a thought on the potential limitations of formal education. He suggests that the structured nature of education might sometimes hinder genuine learning by imposing constraints on one's thinking or stifling curiosity. This quote, placed 8th on our list of Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More emphasizes the importance of maintaining an open and inquisitive mind beyond traditional educational boundaries.\n\n7. \u201cIf I were to start taking care of my grooming, I would no longer be my own self; so, the hell with it.\u201d\n\nEinstein, known for his unconventional appearance, rejected societal standards and prioritized authenticity over conformity.

        "title": "Top 16 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 16 aircraft manufacturers in the world. If you want to skip our introduction to the global aircraft industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World.\n\nThe aircraft industry, just like consumer technology, has been making a lot of news over the past couple of months. This is because, at least when the Western world is concerned, there are only two primary aircraft manufacturing companies whose jets are capable of supporting large scale commercial operations. These are the U.S. aerospace giant The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and its European counterpart Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA). Together, the duo dominates the industry for commercial aviation that is led globally by players the likes of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL).\n\nWhat this means is that aircraft manufacturing has to be precisely managed and carefully monitored to ensure that the stringent requirements of a large tube of aluminum traveling at more than half the speed of sound at thousands of feet in the air are met. On this front, the global aviation industry was shocked when a Boeing 737 Max aircraft's door blew out while it was cruising at altitude. Well, what blew out wasn't technically a door. Instead, it was a door plug that budget airlines use to make room for extra seats, and subsequent investigations revealed that a refurbishment oversight had led to the plug missing crucial bolts that would have held it in place.\n\nFor Boeing stock, the news naturally wasn't greeted well by investors who had already stood by the firm during its recent lowest after crashes that claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The stock is down 18.8% year to date, even while its European rival's shares have appreciated by more than 5% this year so far. The nature of the aviation industry means that since Boeing supplies a substantially larger number of aircraft to airlines than it would have had there been multiple other manufacturers when its production lines stopped due to industry scares or inspection requirements, the impact is significant.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the aftermath of the 737 Max incident, the company shared the impact of the pressurization it faced from regulators and customers in February. Boeing outlined that its aircraft deliveries had shrunk by a third in January, and led the firm to deliver 27 airplanes in January. Had the 737 Max incident not occurred, then Boeing's deliveries might have sat at 38 planes - a fact that underscores the potential impact on a quarterly income statement from a handful of bolts and a lack of oversight. This is particularly painful for Boeing, an established stock that does not pay dividends since it stopped them in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nYet, the firm's size means that it nevertheless did manage to keep up with Airbus when it came to delivering jets. Airbus's January deliveries stood at 30 planes, and for Boeing, despite the fact that deliveries and orders predictably slowed down, it did manage to make inroads into China in 2024. The firm shared in February 2024 that it has delivered three 737 Max's to China, which had suspended Boeing's imports in 2019.\n\nOf course, while commercial aviation dominates the global aviation industry when it comes to size, it is only one portion of the pie. Boeing also makes aircraft for the U.S. military, and along with planes made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), these are capable of both stretching the limits of physics and ferrying service members globally. However, on this front, its Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are more prominent. While Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress, an aircraft named after the literal Stratosphere, is nothing short of a modern engineering marvel capable of delivering fear equally just as well as it can deliver armaments, it's Lockheed and General Dynamics's F-16 Fighting Falcon that is the backbone of the global defense aviation industry.\n\nBut Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus, and Northrop are not the only major aircraft companies. The final segment of this multi billion dollar industry, expected to be worth $626 billion by the end of this decade, is the one that's the most glamorous. This is the private jet industry, and it is dominated by players such as the formidable Brazilian firm Embraer and the well known Gulfstream Corporation. For a detailed look at this particular sub segment of the global aviation industry, you can check out 15 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the World.\n\nSo, which companies are at the top when it comes to global aircraft manufacturing? We took a look, and the notable aircraft stocks in this list are Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Airbus SE (EPA:AIR.PA), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC). Top 15 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World\n\nAn aerial view of a cargo plane taking off from a commercial airport, reflecting the company's overnight air cargo services.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top aircraft manufacturing companies in the world, we first made a list of all publicly traded companies that make aircraft.

        "content": "Tensions are rising around the world, which is good news for some of the top defense stocks to buy.\n\nThere\u2019s an ongoing war in Israel. Drone strikes in Iraq are fanning flames across the Middle East. There\u2019s Ukraine. And then there\u2019s the ongoing U.S. issues with North Korea and China.\u00a0All of which makes some of the top defense stocks to buy indispensable.\n\nDucommun (DCO) Veterans Day. US soldiers. US army. USA patch flag on the US military uniform. United States Armed Forces. Defense stocks\n\nSource: Bumble Dee / Shutterstock.com\n\nDucommun (NYSE:DCO) makes and sells various parts and products for the aerospace sector. It is not as well-known as some of the other names on this list but it is worthy of your attention.\u00a0 For one, it\u2019s a reasonably strong company from a fundamental perspective. When it released earnings in November the results were strong. Earnings per share beat estimates by more than 15%. Revenues increased by more than 5% reaching a record high of $196.25 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs one of the top defense stocks to buy, DCO currently trades just below $50. Analysts believe that they should rise to approximately $65 in the medium term.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is one of those stocks that everyone thinks about when defense is discussed. It is one of the largest defense firms by market capitalization. Thus, the company has a vast platform that has ways to profit when conflict arises.\n\nThe company just won a contract valued at $335 million for fire systems on submarines. It is what is known as a Cost Plus variable contract meaning that its value can rise substantially higher. the total value could rise as high as $611.6 million Assuming options are exercised.\n\nA few days later, the company\u2019s IT division secured a contract valued at $160 million.\u00a0 General Dynamics will train 200,000 Army personnel under the contract.\n\nGeneral Dynamics is a relatively safe, stable investment and includes a dividend. Although that dividend yields a relatively modest 2%, it was last reduced in 1985. General Dynamics is a strong choice for any investors seeking exposure to major government contractors.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nRising global tensions are increasing demand for Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE:LMT) products and services. Plus, investors who purchase LMT shares will get a dividend yielding nearly 3%.\n\nAssuming Lockheed Martin\u2019s technology refresh 3 goes smoothly, demand for its F-35 jets should increase. That will result in increased government spending on its F-35. The government is the largest customer of Lockheed Martin. One can only assume that those working in government and making purchasing decisions may be pressing for increased spending as tensions rise.\n\nAnyway, consider Lockheed Martin for the fact that it provides income for one. then, also consider Lockheed Martin for the fact that it\u2019s relatively inexpensive at the moment based on its P/E ratio.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe story regarding Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is all about artificial intelligence. it continues to grow rapidly following 2023 which also saw it grow very rapidly. it has emerged as an important AI stock overall. It is also a firm with ties to the public sector, particularly defense.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not the primary reason to consider Palantir at the moment. Instead, investors are going to continue to focus on the fact that its commercial revenues increased by 70% in the December quarter. It\u2019s further proof that the emergence of AI in 2023 is anything but a fad.\n\nSo, yes, Palantir is rapidly integrating into a more commercial role. But at the same time, government revenues continue to be the biggest contributor to its overall sales. The point here is simple: \u00a0 government demand for Palantir\u2019s services as a real catalyst ahead as tensions rise. The government seeks any advantage in conflict and artificial intelligence can\u00a0 create decisive advantages.\n\nIf none of that is convincing enough, consider that Palantir posted its 5th consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability on Feb. 5.\n\nVSE Corporation (VSEC) A photograph of two jet fighters flying above clouds. defense stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVSE Corporation (NASDAQ:VSEC) provides fleet overhaul, repair, and maintenance services for air and land transportation in both the commercial and government sectors. It\u2019s logical to assume that demand for the company\u2019s already rapidly growing businesses will grow even more.\n\nFurther, vse Corporation has a history of providing strong positive surprises upon release of earnings. Investors will thus be very curious in the coming weeks in may purchase heavily in anticipation of a March earnings release.\n\nV2X (VVX) defense stocks with dividend growth\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nV2X (NYSE:VVX) provides mission solutions to defense clients in 343 locations across 45 countries. The stock has a lot of potential as one of the top defense stocks to buy for several reasons.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the notion of bookings. Bookings really refer to the future value of contracts a company has secured. In aggregate those bookings are referred to as a backlog. V2X had a record backlog valued at $13.3 billion at the end of the Third quarter. The company was awarded 1.3 billion of those total bookings in the third quarter.\n\nDon\u2019t let that confuse, the company isn\u2019t all about the future at the expense of the present. Instead, it makes substantial sales now with $1 billion coming in the third quarter. That represented an all-time high and an increase of 5%.\n\nThe company already had what it refers to as strong revenue visibility, i.e. that backlog as 2023 wound down. Tensions are rising in 2024 and the company\u2019s backlog is sure to grow as a result.\n\nTerran Orbital (LLAP) (RKLB stock, space stocks) satellite over the Earth\n\nSource: Andrzej Puchta / Shutterstock.com\n\nTerran Orbital (NYSE:LLAP) is a satellite manufacturer with a strong connection to the defense sector. The company provides end-to-end satellite Solutions meaning from manufacture to launch planning. However, its stock has gotten rocked over the last 12 months. Shares currently trade for $0.85. However, analysts expect those same shares to roughly quadruple per consensus opinion.\n\nThe company also recently resolved a shareholder dispute and will discuss its upcoming results on March 26. There is potential for those shares to rise between now and then. It\u2019s clear that the company is under very real pressure to increase share prices following that meeting. Shareholders stated their confidence in the firm following the meeting.

        "title": "7 Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy in February for High Total Returns",
        "content": "Investors can purchase undervalued dividend stocks to form the backbone of any portfolio. I say this because these stocks are generally low-beta and represent blue-chip companies.\n\nGrowth stocks com with a high-beta and significant uncertainties related to cash flows. Of course, it\u2019s a mix of growth and dividend stocks that help in creating a quality portfolio.\n\nWithin the dividend stock space, this column investigates names that are also trading at a valuation gap. Being undervalued dividend stocks, I expect high total returns from these names in the next three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAn important point to note is that blue-chip dividend stocks generally trade at a premium valuation. However, there can be industry or temporary company specific headwinds that translate into a valuation gap.\n\nThese undervalued dividend stocks opportunities do not come easy and should therefore not be ignored. It\u2019s likely that some of these dividend stocks outperform growth stocks in term of total returns. A good example is the big rally in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock in the last 12 to 15 months.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock has slipped by 33% in the last 12 months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 21.5, the stock looks undervalued and offers a robust dividend yield of 4.77%.\n\nI remain optimistic about potential expansionary policies later this year. As gold trends higher, NEM stock is likely to surge from oversold levels.\n\nIn November 2023, Newmont completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining to create the world\u2019s leading gold mining business. With the closing of the acquisition, Newmont expects to achieve $2 billion in \u201ccash improvements through portfolio optimization in the first two years.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Newmont has an investment grade balance sheet that allows for aggressive investment in exploration. Reserve replacement is likely to remain robust. For Q3 2023, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAssuming that gold trends higher, OCF is likely to be more than $5 billion this year. This is one of the undervalued dividend stocks to buy for growth.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T logo on wooden background\n\nSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) stock has made a small comeback with an upside of 18.5% in the last six months. AT&T, however, remains one of the deeply undervalued dividend stocks at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.7. Further, the dividend yield of 6.52% is attractive, and I believe dividends are sustainable.\n\nThe first point to note is that AT&T reported free cash flow of $16.8 billion for 2023. Further, the company has guided for FCF of $17 to $18 billion for this year. Strong cash flows provide headroom for dividends and AT&T has been deleveraging on a continued basis. The target is to achieve net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x in the first half of 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that with some investments in the last five years, AT&T has a strong 5G and fiber network in the United States. This has translated into continued growth in phone and fiber subscribers. I expect this trend to sustain on the back of 5G adoption.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock has been in a downtrend with the decline in revenue from the vaccine against covid-19. It seems that the correction is overdone and PFE stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.4. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 6.07%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that for 2023, Pfizer reported a record number of nine new molecular entity approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This sets stage for heathy growth in the coming years. Further, Pfizer has a product pipeline of 112 candidates with 31 molecular entities in Phase three. This will ensure that Pfizer is back on track for growth. As a matter of fact, the company has guided for 3% to 5% year-on-year growth for 2024.\n\nThe company has been active on the acquisition front. Pfizer expects $25 billion in incremental revenue from new business deals by 2030. With the recent completion of the acquisition of Seagen, the company has boosted its oncology pipeline.\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX)\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe factors of macroeconomic headwinds and tight monetary policies have translated into a correction for oil.\n\nI see this as a good opportunity to accumulate some of the best oil and gas stocks. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is a top name to consider and trades at a valuation gap. CVX stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 4.29%.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Chevron has an investment grade balance sheet, and that\u2019s one reason to like to stock. Further, the company\u2019s oil assets have an attractive break-even. This translates into robust operating and free cash flows. For 2023, Chevron reported $35.6 billion in operating cash flows.\n\nRobust cash flows position the company for aggressive investments and healthy dividend growth. Once it completes the acquisition of Hess Corporation, the company is targeting $16 to $18 billion in annual capital investments.\n\nAnother important point to note is that Chevron has guided for average annual free cash flow growth of 10%. This sets stage for healthy dividend growth in the coming years. Also, if expansionary monetary policies are pursued later this year, I expect oil to surge higher.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO) the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong industrial commodity stocks, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) looks undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 9.3. RIO stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 5.2%.\n\nDemand worries from China is one concern for Rio Tinto. However, if global GDP growth remains sluggish, expansionary monetary policies are likely. This will support growth and potential upside in commodities and energy.\n\nRio reported operating cash flow of $7 billion for the first half of 2023. The iron ore segment remains the cash flow machine and healthy OCF ensures stable dividends.\n\nHowever, I like the fact that Rio Tinto is focused on portfolio diversification. In the next five years, I expect meaningfully higher production of metals that support energy transition.\n\nThis includes the likes of copper, aluminium, titanium, and lithium. With high financial flexibility for investments, Rio Tinto is well positioned to benefit from investments in global decarbonisation.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith rising geopolitical tensions, I would hold at least one defense stock in my core portfolio. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and looks undervalued. LMT stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.94%.\n\nAs of Q4 2023, Lockheed Martin reported a record order backlog of $160.6 billion. The backlog provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For the current year, Lockheed has guided for free cash flow of $6 to $6.3 billion.\n\nWith the order intake remaining strong, it\u2019s likely that FCF will be higher in 2025 and beyond. This will ensure steady dividend growth.\n\nLockheed has the flexibility to invest in next-generation defense technology. This includes hypersonic solutions, next-generation interceptors, spectrum dominance, and space technology.\n\nA recent report indicates that only 35% of NATO countries meet the Group\u2019s defense spending target. This underscores my view on healthy backlog growth and a positive outlook for LMT stock.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock has plunged by almost 60% in the last 12 months. The reason is a sharp correction in lithium.\n\nI see this decline as an opportunity to accumulate and ALB stock looks undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.6. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 1.33% and I expect healthy dividend growth once lithium makes a comeback.\n\nEven with depressed lithium prices, Albemarle reported 10% year-on-year growth in revenue for Q3 2023 to $2.3 billion. The company has also guided for positive operating cash flows of $600 to $800 million for 2023. With cost cutting measures underway, I don\u2019t see any financial stress for Albemarle.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that expansion plans will be delayed to moderate the capital investments. Albemarle had earlier planned to triple lithium conversion capacity to 600ktpa by 2027 as compared to 2022. With the long-term outlook for lithium remaining positive, I am bullish on a strong reversal for ALB stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the top 20 defense contractors in the world, and share a detailed overview of the global defense spending patterns and the economic boom in the arms industry triggered by conflicts around the world. You can skip our analysis and head over directly to the list of the Top 5 Defense Contractors in 2024.\n\nThe world has been rocked with conflict over the last few years. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone beyond 700 days, with no immediate end in sight. In the Caucasus, Azerbaijan and Armenia continue to engage in regular exchange of fire, after the Azeris seized control of previously Armenian controlled territory in the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020. The Middle East is up in flames as well, in what defense analysts describe as the worst crisis in the region since the Arab Israeli War in 1973. Israel invaded Gaza in October last year, after Hamas staged a series of coordinated attacks across different parts of Israel.\n\nWhile final figures for 2023 are awaited, 2022 was a record-year for defense expenditure, with global military spending reaching an all-time high of $2.2 trillion during the year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. $961 billion were spent in the Americas, $540 billion in Asia, while Europe witnessed its steepest rise in three decades and saw its defense spending total $480 billion in 2022. On the other hand, $39 billion were spent on procuring weapons by countries in Africa, while $35 billion was incurred by Oceanic countries.\n\nThe demand for weapons has meant a boom in the arms industry. Large defense contractors like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) are expecting the situation in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s war against Palestinian group Hamas to drive up revenue flow.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has received $3 billion worth of orders since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, that are tied with replenishing Kyiv. In October, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s shares rose 2% after it beat estimates and reported a higher than anticipated revenue and profit in its third quarter results. The improved financial performance was driven by a sustained demand for weapons and equipment amid geopolitical tensions.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s guided multiple launch rocket system, as well as the Javelin anti-tank missiles \u2013 which the company has jointly-developed in conjunction with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) \u2013 have proven pivotal in Ukraine\u2019 war efforts against Russia.\n\nThe combat systems unit at General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), which manufactures tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, also reported 25% higher revenue in its third quarter results in 2023 compared to the same time period a year ago. The company\u2019s output of artillery has already increased from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has projected sales of between $40.8 billion and $41.2 billion in 2024, owing to an expectation of sustained demand for its weapons. In early 2023, the US Army awarded a $522 million contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and Global Military Products to manufacture artillery ammunition for Kyiv. Moreover, the company\u2019s shares are up by over 6% since the declaration of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in October 2023. Top 20 Defense Contractors in 2024\n\nJordan Tan / Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe top 20 defense contractors are ranked in ascending order of their defense revenue in 2022. This is the latest year for which figures for all large defense companies are available, as some of them are yet to declare their full-year 2023 financial statements. Data has been sourced from Defense News. Defense revenue includes sales to government bodies, such as the Department of Defense in the U.S. or its equivalent in another country, as well as business activities with other related contractors.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Biden Boom: 7 Stocks to Buy if Democrats Win the Election in 2024",
        "content": "We\u2019ve entered another election year, with President Biden likely to face off once more against former President Trump. The polls currently show a tight race, though Biden\u2019s approval ratings have slipped since his victory in 2020. There\u2019s ample time for that to change before November 2024 \u2013 if the economy stays strong under Democratic policies, Biden could regain his edge.\n\nI\u2019m not here to make election predictions. But it\u2019s wise for investors looking to make strategic investments to game out various scenarios. If the Democrats pull off another win, what stocks should be on your shopping list? Which companies and sectors stand to benefit from four more years of Biden\u2019s plans and priorities?\n\nI\u2019ll share seven stocks worth snatching up if you think Team Blue will hold the White House. These aren\u2019t partisan picks \u2013 just smart bets based on where Biden and the Democrats plan to steer the economy. I\u2019ll look at stocks poised to profit from continued government spending on infrastructure and climate initiatives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, I\u2019ll have another article soon for investors betting on a potential Republican win. These stocks will highlight companies aligned with former president Trump and the GOP\u2019s tax-cutting, deregulatory vision. Let\u2019s focus today on Democrat-friendly stocks and start building a portfolio to prosper if Biden manages to repeat his 2020 feat. Even if Biden\u2019s prospects look murky, savvy investors should plan multiple moves ahead. The Justice Department is throwing sand in Trump\u2019s gear, so nothing is crystal clear yet.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) Assembly Plant in Tilburg, Netherlands.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you are a long-time Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investor, the company\u2019s latest earnings report was likely a disappointment for you. Revenue missed estimates, and the company\u2019s quarterly net profits declined sequentially due to production and delivery challenges. However, I believe too many investors are overly pessimistic about Tesla\u2019s future prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s true that rising interest rates have dampened demand for big-ticket items like EVs. Tesla also faces intensifying competition, especially in China. Yet, with just 1% EV adoption in the massive U.S. auto market, Tesla retains tremendous room for growth in its home territory over the long-run. Once interest rates decline and macro conditions improve, pent-up demand for Tesla vehicles could drive surging sales.\n\nCurrently, being able to buy TSLA stock under $200 per share seems like a bargain to me. This is a revolutionary company leading the sustainability revolution. Even with near-term headwinds, few can match Tesla\u2019s brand power, vertically-integrated structure, and software/AI expertise. Tesla holds the technology to eventually offer an autonomous ride-hailing network that is far more profitable than selling vehicles.\n\nI\u2019m also bullish because Democrats overtly favor EVs and clean energy incentives. So, policy tailwinds could strengthen considerably if a Democrat retakes the Presidency in 2024. Betting against Tesla has proven foolish time and again. I believe investors with a five-to-ten-year horizon will be rewarded handsomely buying TSLA stock at today\u2019s depressed valuations.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Tesla, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has faced demand issues thanks to rising interest rates and the chilling macro environment. Its stock has plunged over 32% from its highs. Yet, I spy a golden buying opportunity for solar stocks, and FSLR stock is one I\u2019m including in this bunch.\n\nAs mentioned already, Democrat administrations strongly back renewable energy development, with solar and wind at the forefront. If a Democrat retakes the White House in 2024, expansive climate incentives could supercharge solar adoption. Even under divided governance, ongoing cost efficiencies will continue, making solar ever more cost-competitive for households and businesses.\n\nIn the company\u2019s third quarter, First Solar delivered 27.4% revenue growth. Analysts forecast 33% revenue growth for all of 2023, with strong profitability to follow. The company\u2019s superb 33.5% net profit margin is due partly to generous government solar subsidies, and I think those subsidies are unlikely to disappear anytime soon. With a forward price-earnings ratio of 12-times based on 2024 earnings estimates, FSLR stock seems like a bargain relative to its earnings growth potential.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is an American energy tech innovator specializing in advanced solar solutions like microinverters. Its systems are gaining share by maximizing solar efficiency in residential and commercial markets.\n\nLike its peers, Enphase faces demand uncertainty in today\u2019s macro environment. Its stock slid 60% from peak levels as part of the broader selloff in equities and higher-multiple tech names. Yet, with ENPH stock having cratered, the company\u2019s risk/reward now looks far more positively-skewed.\n\nAssuming Democrats regain power in 2024, Enphase is set to benefit enormously, given the Biden administration\u2019s generous stance toward renewable energy credits and incentives. Even more impactful could be the passage of a nationwide clean electricity standard accelerating the shift from fossil fuels. Regardless of policy shifts, U.S. solar capacity will likely increase by 38% this year.\n\nEnphase aims to keep gross margins near 40% in 2024 while reversing its sales downturn. Its systems will be integral as more households, businesses, and utilities adopt solar plus storage solutions. Enphase\u2019s depressed valuation prices in an overly bearish future. Thus, I think this beaten-down clean energy stock appears primed for upside once growth visibility improves.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) has not had the prettiest stock chart recently. This EV charging company still operates at a loss and relies heavily on government funding to finance growth. This has led to dilution for current shareholders, and a stock price that has plummeted nearly 96% from its 2021 peak.\n\nHowever, the pace of decline has slowed recently, after a very tough 2022/2023. CHPT stock has been trading relatively flat since last November, and I don\u2019t anticipate it breaking below the $2 level soon, barring an economic black swan. With $367 million in cash reserves available today, ChargePoint should have enough capital to finance operations for a couple of quarters without requiring further dilution.\n\nMore government stimulus could prove to be the catalyst that kicks ChargePoint\u2019s growth into overdrive. Just last month, we got word of $623 million in new federal grants for EV charging networks. Consider that a drop in the bucket relative to what\u2019s truly needed to build nationwide infrastructure for mass EV adoption. If the Democrats retain the White House, expect billions more to flow into this still-nascent industry. ChargePoint\u2019s first-mover status in EV charging could pay off in a big way.\n\nThis stock might look ugly today, but future prospects remain bright if infrastructure spending keeps growing under president Biden.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlongside the clean energy and EV sectors, the Biden administration has nurtured another sector \u2013 defense. Regional wars and geopolitical tensions have escalated over the past two years, with no signs of cooling anytime soon. The U.S. has flooded battlefield allies with American-made weapons and vehicles. A Democrat victory would likely perpetuate this foreign policy agenda and sustain the torrent of money flowing into the military-industrial complex.\n\nThat bodes especially well for General Dynamics (NYSE:GD). This defense giant manufactures cutting-edge ships, combat vehicles, weapons systems, and information technology for the Pentagon and allies abroad. General Dynamics\u2019 revenue nudged up 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023, while operating profit saw a 5% bump. However, the G700 Gulfstream business jet certification delays did create a slight drag on its results. The company still churned out $3.8 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2023, with a superb 115% cash conversion rate. Expect delayed G700 deliveries to shift into 2024, powering earnings growth. And don\u2019t forget \u2013 General Dynamics\u2019 backlog expanded to a towering $93.6 billion.\n\nThe company paid $1.4 billion in dividends last quarter alone, and anticipate another $4 billion in share buybacks this coming fiscal year. General Dynamics also used $434 million of this cash to repurchase shares, ending 2023 with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. I think GD stock offers nice value, alongside a safe 1.96% dividend yield. This defense giant wins no matter which party captures the White House.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) produces some of the most lethal and technologically-dominant aircraft weaponry in the world \u2013 from stealthy F-35 fighters to missile defense systems. As one of the primary arms suppliers for NATO forces and allies, Lockheed has cultivated strong international demand. With military tensions escalating globally, defense spending is skyrocketing across Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Much of that budget increase directly benefits Lockheed.\n\nUnlike Russia and China, NATO military doctrine relies heavily on aerial combat operations. That strategic focus prompts member countries to invest disproportionately more in fighter jets and missiles than ground vehicles or naval assets. In other words \u2013 the world needs Lockheed Martin\u2019s specialty now more than ever. Despite a slight drop in FY23 revenue and earnings due to one-time impacts, Lockheed achieved a record-high $160.6 billion backlog last quarter. Free cash flow also nudged up to $1.66 billion.\n\nThis defense titan continues funneling capital back to shareholders, even amid macro uncertainties. Last year, the company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. The stock now trades at reasonable valuation levels compared to historical norms. Expect expanded production of Lockheed\u2019s stealthy F-35, plus elevated demand for tactical missiles like the Hellfire and Javelin. Geopolitical crises show no signs of abating anytime soon. With a new Cold War brewing, Lockheed Martin promises strong, steady growth regardless of election outcomes.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) may not seem the most exciting stock pick these days. This vaccine giant benefited immensely from taxpayer support through Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer\u2019s share price skyrocketed to nearly $60/share at its peak. But with the pandemic fading and underwhelming demand for boosters, Pfizer has retreated more than 54% from its highs.\n\nDon\u2019t let the recent slide fool you, though. Pfizer remains a dominant force in the healthcare arena. Excluding pandemic products, the company still delivered 7% year-over-year operational sales growth in 2023. While Covid-19 vaccine revenue will continue fading, Pfizer\u2019s core pharmaceutical business shows enduring strength thanks to new product launches.\n\nManagement guided for another 6%-8% operational sales expansion in 2024, plus ~11% adjusted earnings per share growth. Pfizer\u2019s robust pipeline and diverse portfolio should power top-line strength for years, making the current valuation look rather tempting. Shares trade at just 12-times forward earnings estimates \u2013 dirt cheap by historical benchmarks.\n\nRising free cash flow generation also enables Pfizer\u2019s generous capital return programs. The company rewards shareholders with a 6% dividend yield, plus ongoing buybacks. For investors with longer time horizons, PFE stock appears primed for upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT Space business unit recently clinched a modification contract involving support for a missile flight test. The award has been offered by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $193.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Feb 25, 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide design, development, build, and integration of equipment for missile flight test demonstrations and fielding.\n\nA major portion of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Littleton, CO.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nIncreasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.\r\n\r\nNotably, Lockheed\u2019s Space business unit, apart from developing satellites and space transportation systems, also builds strike missiles as well as missile defense systems. Its major programs include Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, the one with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States. The unit also designs Next Generation Interceptor, a program with the Missile Defense Agency, utilizing next-generation propulsion and sensors to provide homeland missile defense. The Space unit\u2019s portfolio also includes Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, which provides the U.S. Space Force with enhanced worldwide missile warning capabilities.\r\n\r\nAs one of the major missile makers in the United States and with such remarkable missile and missile warning systems in its product portfolio, Lockheed enjoys a strong demand base in the missile defense market. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nPer a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the missiles and missile defense system market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.8% during the 2024-2029 period. Such an expanding market is likely to benefit LMT as it enjoys a solid position in the military missile market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome other prominent defense majors that have a strong position in the missile and associated parts manufacturing industry and are thus also likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding missile defense market have been discussed below.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.\n\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3%.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Will Sell $23 Billion Worth of F-16 Fighter Jets to Turkey",
        "content": "Military contractor Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) is in the business of building fighter jets -- and business is booming. In a pair of Earth-shaking announcements last week, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) informed Congress of a plan to sell a combined $31.6 billion in new weapons sales to Greece and Turkey.\n\nBut the biggest of these deals is for Turkey.\n\nWhy is Turkey buying 40 new F-16 fighter jets?\n\nAs you may already know, DSCA is the Pentagon department responsible for coordinating sensitive weapons sales between U.S. defense contractors and foreign governments. Turkey says it wants these new fighter jets to \"expand and modernize\" its air force, which currently comprises primarily older F-16C Falcon and F-4E Phantom fighter jets. Before this sale can go through, though, the U.S. State Department must sign off on the deal as supporting \"the foreign policy goals and national security of the United States\" and unlikely to \"alter the basic military balance in the region\" -- in this case, southern Europe -- and Congress must either approve or reject the sale.\n\nThat's the stage we're at in this process right now.\n\nAbsent a refusal by Congress, therefore, Lockheed Martin will be named the \"principal contactor\" on a deal to sell Turkey 40 brand-new F-16 fighter jets. It will also upgrade 79 F-16s that Turkey already owns to a new F-16V (for \"Viper\") configuration.\n\nAdjacent to this work, Lockheed will coordinate the delivery of some 48 F110-GE-129D engines from General Electric(NYSE: GE), along with radars, navigation systems, missile launchers, and auto-cannons -- and more than 3,000 assorted bombs, missiles, and \"smart bomb\" guidance kits from a whole series of other U.S. defense contractors.\n\nTotal cost for all this hardware: $23 billion.\n\nWhy is Greece buying 40 new F-35 fighter jets?\n\nAnd that's not all.\n\nGreece also wants to \"modernize its air force.\" So simultaneous with the Turkey announcement, DSCA advised Congress of a corresponding deal to arm Turkish neighbor Greece with 40 new F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets. Here, Lockheed Martin will share the principal contractor role with fellow defense contracting heavyweight RTX Corporation(NYSE: RTX), which makes the F135 engines that power the F-35, on a sale worth $8.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn contrast to the Turkey deal, no upgrades will be involved in this sale. (This will be Greece's first purchase of the F-35, after all.) Greece also isn't buying a lot of ordnance, which helps to further explain the sale's smaller size -- although Greece is buying 42 Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 engines from RTX, and additional weapons purchases may follow. Also on the horizon may be even more sales of the F-35 as the country's F-4E and Mirage 2000 aircraft age out of service, and potentially upgrades of Greece's own F-16 fleet (which like Turkey's comprises primarily older F-16C variants).\n\nSo keep an eye on that as an opportunity for future Lockheed Martin sales.\n\nWhat it means for Lockheed Martin stock\n\nAs for now, the $31.6 billion in total revenue that will flow through Lockheed Martin across these two weapons deals is quite large enough to move the needle on this defense contractor. Even assuming that much of this revenue will ultimately end up at other defense companies, if we apply Lockheed Martin's operating profit margin (10.2% for its aeronautics unit, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence) to the revenue at first point of impact, these two deals alone have the potential to generate in excess of $3.2 billion in operating profit.\n\nThat's more than one full year's worth of profit for the aeronautics division, and more than 36% of all the profit that Lockheed Martin earned across all divisions in 2023.\n\nSo what does this mean for investors? Well, it ultimately depends on how long it takes Lockheed to deliver these 80 new fighter jets to (and upgrade 79 more for) its customers. But we seem to be looking here at a combined 47% increase in sales and 36% boost in earnings compared to Lockheed's 2023 sales and earnings. Spread that out over even, say, five years, and I anticipate this weapons deal has the potential to more than double the 3.2% annualized earnings growth rate that most analysts have penciled in for Lockheed Martin.\n\nLong story short, analysts' forecasts for Lockheed Martin's growth rate are too low. And Lockheed Martin's stock price should therefore go higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Does Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?",
        "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nWhat Is Lockheed Martin's Net Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of December 2023, Lockheed Martin had US$17.5b of debt, up from US$15.5b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.44b, its net debt is less, at about US$16.0b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Lockheed Martin's Balance Sheet?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Lockheed Martin had liabilities of US$16.9b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$28.7b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.44b as well as receivables valued at US$15.3b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$28.9b.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin has a very large market capitalization of US$103.1b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nWith a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.6, Lockheed Martin uses debt artfully but responsibly. And the alluring interest cover (EBIT of 9.9 times interest expense) certainly does not do anything to dispel this impression. Also positive, Lockheed Martin grew its EBIT by 21% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Lockheed Martin can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Lockheed Martin recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, Lockheed Martin's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its EBIT growth rate also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Lockheed Martin's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted  1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should be aware of.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

        "title": "13 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best aerospace and defense stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today.\n\nHowever, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics.\n\nThese days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order.\n\nPowering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer.\n\nSo what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world.\n\nThat's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -\u00a0 a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with.\n\nLockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace.\n\nSo, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks. Among these, the notable ones are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX). 13 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In\n\nAndrey Khachatryan/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best aerospace and defense stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable aerospace and defense stocks that trade in U.S. markets by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q3 2023.

        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s report, a total amount of $2.21 trillion was spent on military expenses worldwide in 2022. However, this comes as no surprise as countries tend to spend a significant portion of their GDP on their military to strengthen defenses and stay competitive in the world, every year. At the same time, there are also some countries with no army, navy, or air force (See: 15 Countries that have no Army, Navy, or Air Force) but continue to thrive, thanks to the agreements they have with strong countries like the US, France, and Australia to protect them against attacks of any sort. Note that the US, France, and Australia are considered \u201cstrong countries\u201d because they have strong economies and powerful militaries (See: 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023) to serve and protect the citizens.\n\nAs of 2024, the United States is the strongest military in the world, followed by China, Russia and India. But are they also the strongest when it comes to reserve military manpower?\n\nReserve military are soldiers who have serve some years in the military and then join the Army Reserves or National Guard. Reservists get military perks as they are part of the military without devoting themselves full-time to the military. Military benefits from reserve manpower in times of emergencies as they can call reservists anytime to duty when the country is in need. Some countries are facing a decline in their active and reserve manpower despite having a high-end military.\n\nFor instance, according to Pew Research, 18% of the US population was serving in the military in 1980, but the percentage dropped to 6% in 2022. They've also forecasted that although around 18.3 million veterans in the US, the numbers will decline to 12.1 million in the next 25 years \u2014 by 2048. The gradual fall in military manpower is an area of concern for the United States. But still, for now, it is the number one miliary in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nMilitary Spending and the Arms and Ammunition Industry\n\nIn 2022, the US spent $877 billion on its military, which was 3.5% of its total GDP. Military spending by governments surges during wars and conflicts, and companies that manufacture and supply arms and ammunition achieve the most profitable outcomes.\n\nDuring the Ukraine-Russia war, the US\u2019s big five defense contractors made huge profits in 2022 from selling weapons to Ukraine. According to Reuters, the big five MIC companies in defense industry, Boeing (NYSE: BA), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), and RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX) earned $157.5 billion in fiscal year 2023, an increase from $153.6 billion in fiscal year 2022.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, the sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments rose by 16% to a record $238 billion. As the Russia-Ukraine war is ongoing, the defense industry will continue to rise, and the MIC of the United States will continue to make profits. As reported by Global Times, War is \"good for business,\" a recruiter for BlackRock Inc (NYSE: BLK) told the O'Keefe Media Group.\n\nAs of February 9, 2024, Australia pledged an additional AUD 400 million to Boeing (NYSE: BA)'s indigenous Ghost Bat autonomous drone program. The government previously signed an AUD 600 million contract with Boeing (NYSE: BA) to sustain and upgrade F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets for the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nSimilarly, in December 2023, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, a business unit of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), was awarded a $654.5 million contract by the Army Contracting Command of Newark, NJ for the metal parts program for M1128. General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) was selected alongside IMT Defense for this contract, and both companies will be competing for each order of the contract.\n\nOn the other hand, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), a US weapons manufacturer, signed contracts with some leading Saudi companies at the World Defense Show in Riyadh on 5 February 2024. The company awarded Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) subcontracts to a pair of Saudi Arabian firms, Middle East Propulsion Company (MEPC) and Arabian International Company (AIC), for locally manufacturing parts of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) missile system.\n\nAs geopolitical changes and conflicts are occurring more often than before, countries heavily depend on their military, including the army, navy, and air force, to defend the country in crucial times. In the list below, we discuss the top countries with the most reserve military manpower in the world. 15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World\n\nGlynnis Jones / Shutterstock\n\nOur Methodology\n\nCountries with the most reserve military manpower in the world are listed in ascending order of the size of their reserve force.

Following our prepared remarks, there will be a formal question-and-answer session.\r\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Sam Rubin, LightPath\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nStory continues\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nThank you, Al, and good afternoon to everyone, and welcome to LightPath Technologies' fiscal quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Our financial results press release was issued after the market closed today and posted on our corporate website.\r\n First, I\u2019d like to apologize for any coughing or horsey sound. My throat is still recovering from COVID I had recently. Second quarter was underscored by a key first order in our partnership with Lockheed Martin for an imaging engineered solution. The ongoing integration of Visimid acquisition and progress with customers transitioning from the use of germanium to the use of our BlackDiamond material. All these developments continue to highlight our strategic shift from a components manufacturer to a value-added solutions provider.\r\n To recap for our investors, LightPath has been transitioning in the last few years from a pure components manufacturer focused on being the lowest cost provider to value-added partner for complete solutions based on optical technologies, whose differentiators are mostly technological.\r\n Along those lines, we have been focusing on three pillars of growth: imaging solutions, such as cameras; growth in new markets, such as automotive; and growth specifically of our market share in the defense business. All of which are driven by our unique technologies and materials.\r\n All three pillars of growth tie and support our transition from a components manufacturer to a provider of engineered solutions based on our proprietary technologies. This transition began a couple of years ago, starting from customized lens assemblies, which is all what we call LighPath 2.0 through cameras solutions. The first of which was our innovative Mantis broadband infrared camera, which enables both new applications and capabilities for our customers and significant growth in that direction coming from the Visimid acquisition.\r\n Visimid Technologies, a small engineering firm based out of Dallas, Texas, does to the back end of thermal cameras what LightPath has been doing for the front end of those cameras. LightPath has been tailoring and customizing the optics for cameras based on our best optical technologies, and Visimid customizes and tailors the video processing engine and support electronics for the same cameras. Like LightPath's business model for customizing optical assemblies to be used in infrared cameras, Visimid established itself as the go-to for customized for customizing the electronics and software part of uncooled infrared cameras. In fact, we estimate has customized for Lightbox electronics and software of our Mentor schedule together would resubmit. We now extend our offering to customize imaging solutions to include wholly integrated camera modules, increasing the offering to existing customers and providing us a bigger share of those customers spent.\r\n During the second quarter, we continued the integration of visit with a focus on new products in fire, safety and defense. This acquisition, added the capability to produce end-to-end custom imaging cores and a new engineering capabilities that allow us to be involved earlier with our customers' design cycle and increase our likelihood of servicing service designs through manufacturing. We are integrating visited customers in custom imaging cores into new camera products, several of which demonstrated at the recent SHOT Show in Las Vegas and some we're working to customers with customers to develop customized solutions. All these products are utilizing spins amid unique video engine in conjunction with our optics to develop low weight, high efficiency solutions for drones, UAVs as well as industrial applications such as gas leak sensing, process control and early fire detection. Shortly after the acquisition of estimated Lockheed Martin awarded with Summit and Lightpath a major project for the design development and later on the manufacturing of a complete imaging system for a new project in the midfield division, which the award came, what will be up to $7.5 million for the development money, 4.7 million of that was already in a formal purchase order and is now part of our backlog.\r\n Okay.\r\n Interest project, Lockheed Martin is competing against another prime defense contractor to develop a new missile system at first, the development portion of this project was expected to last until 2028, at which point the end customer would decide if the production is awarded to Lockheed Martin or its competitor. However, there is significant pressure now to shorten this time line as much as possible. And as such, the decision point has recently been pulled in, and we now expect that the decision regarding the production award will be as early as 2026 to 2 years ahead of the schedule we shared during the announcement of our initial award. If Lockheed Martin is selected for the production, we expect an initial production order for around 10,000 units. Our ASP per unit is between 5,000 to $10,000. That will put the initial expected production would have been north of 50 million. That is a production order to LightPath. Additionally, the volumes for follow up production have also increased with the potential now for tens of thousands of units of units. The demand and shorten timelines for the project are being impacted by recent geopolitical escalation results so far are very positive and our customers, in fact, very confident. And so confident about the solution that they're looking to begin investing in production of the units even before an official decision is made. As such, we expect that Lightpath might start building up the production line this year already the basic infrastructure from this production line has already been prepared and paid for as part of our recent expansion of our Orlando facility and the specific equipment that will be needed is expected to be paid for by Department of Defense. Once in production, we will be delivering this assembly in volume, estimated tens of thousands of assemblies over the program lifetime. And again, with ASPs for LightPath between 5,000 to $10,000 per system with thousands of dollars per unit and tens of thousands of units expected in that program. The ultimate selection of light of Lockheed Martin Bison military would likely result in a substantial revenue opportunity for us. This is exactly the direction we've been looking to transform the Company to which the new strategy and it is now happening, look, its decision to outsource the development of such an important part of this system is due to what's due to its technical capabilities yet the decision to then further engage with us at the scales are now engaging. And the potential manufacturing of this is due to the combination of LightPath and visit with our manufacturing capabilities, capacities and most important, the ability to integrate the entire system. And while our strategy for having three pillars of growth are designed, such that we don't put all our eggs in one basket or one product for that matter. This award by a major prime with the massive potential for revenue on the manufacturing side is seen by us as a big wind tower strategy and the execution of that Foods acquisition of bismuth and our own investment in expansion in the U.S. and development of camera technologies, I could probably spend this entire call only on the specific project and activity, given that we expected to lead to tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue. But this is only one of multiple projects and multiple opportunities we have going up, all of which are in similar scales. I will talk briefly about some of the rest of it.\r\n Turning to the automotive market, as previously mentioned, our lens assembly system has already been qualified by one of the largest car companies. Since then, we have shipped samples through qualification by another large Tier one and begins a qualification process that is expected to take a few months. Last call, we shared that the first company was reevaluating their time line in light of recent changes to the EV market. While our technology is not specific to EV. We found that most of our automotive Tier one customers were looking to roll out this technology in ENZREV.s and that was their main focus at the time with dynamics of the market now changing, we expect that some of our Tier one customers will begin rolling out this technology in more traditional vehicles. We are also seeing signs from the market that automotive companies are waiting for further development in the Department of Transportation's announcement from May on every intention of mandating emergency braking system and mandating improvement on that for that technology and nighttime operation. We don't expect any major developments in the very short term, but we're still confident that this technology is going to be implemented in the automotive space and that we are one of the leaders in this technology and use case. Therefore, we will still see we will still see this as something that would lead to the same volumes we spoke about before, which are over 1 million assemblies a year for each one of the car companies with ASPs up to $50 per vehicle for LightPath.\r\n Last thing I will update on inferred materials and replacing germanium. To recap. Litepoint has developed over the years and mainly over the last two years some exclusive unique materials that can be used instead of germanium in infrared imaging systems. China announced on July fourth, export restrictions on germanium and with China being the largest exporter of this material. This has become a big deal since then. And even prior to that, actually, we've been working diligently to come with customers to have the systems redesigned use our materials instead of germanium, we even took some steps a few months ago of proactively canceling some customer orders for germanium optics to free up our capacity for making optics from these new materials. So this has paid off well with customers now fully engaged in the process and focused on redesign of their systems testing of prototypes and starting to order systems with new optics to specific examples I'd like to share. One includes our largest customer, which makes imaging devices for supporting this customer began by evaluating the use of our material in only one of their products and has recently let us know that they would like to now work with us on all their product.\r\n Another customer who is in the defense business has announced in the recent SHOT Show a new gun sight product that is using only our Black Diamond glass unit with NoJo medium and say I've even gone as far as seeing publicly for that going forward, all new products are going to be designed only with Black Diamond materials, a major win for our directions. All of this, all of these have so far been using mainly our existing BD6 materials. In December, we finally took delivery of a piece of equipment called the refrac diameter and measurement system for optical glass. This will now enable us to speed up the manufacturing readiness of some of the new materials we license from anywhere. We expect the first material BD&L fall to be formally released later this month. Bd&l four is an example of a materials that not only replaces germanium. It actually offers advantages versus germanium by having a negative thermal optic coefficient. That is the change of the optical index as a function of temperature BD&L for enables optical designers to design optical systems that are optically and passively compensated for changes in temperature. This is a big deal for airborne systems. For example, where today changes in ambient temperature at different altitudes require refocusing the cameras to compensate for this BD&L four is expected to become an important material for thermal cameras. In drones and other airborne systems variants, a large range of temperature.\r\n To conclude our shift in strategic directions beginning to show the results we were looking for both in winning some major programs and in revenue growth in that area. At the same time, our three separate areas of growth solutions, defense and automotive continue to generate multiple independent opportunities that many of them have a potential for tens of billions of dollars of new revenue tail opportunity, resulting in a healthy pipeline of large scale opportunities that any of them alone can be transformative to our business.\r\n Last, I would like to welcome Kim Carter, who joined our Board of Directors last week as an independent director replacing Leesburg. So it had retired after 25 years with the Company, I would like to thank Mr. Lee Berkeley's, diligent work over the years, and welcome Mr. Peter Kim was formerly the Chief Technology Officer from the U.S. space. Force and has retired as a two star general. Having a person as Mr. on our Board of Directors is important as we continue to move forward with our focus on becoming a systems company with a strong focus on defense. And as always, I would like to focus our importance to thank our employees and stakeholders who have continued to work diligently through the various transitions and hurdles we have endured. We see a bright future and a growing company because of their dedication, patience and hard work. Now I will return the call to our CFO, Al Miranda, to review second quarter financial results. Al?\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nThank you, Sam. You can rest your voice for a little bit.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nThank you.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nI'd like to remind everyone that much of the information we're discussing during this call is also included in our press release issued earlier today and will be included in the 10 Q for the period. I encourage everyone to visit our website at lightpath.com. To access these documents and to see some of our new products. I will discuss some of the primary financial performance metrics and provide additional color on them to better assist assist investors in analyzing the Company.\r\n On a consolidated basis, revenue for the fiscal second quarter were $7.3 million compared to $8.5 million in the year ago period. Sales of infrared components were $3.6 million or 49% of the Company's consolidated revenue in the fiscal second quarter. Revenue from visible components was $2.7 million or 37% of revenue. Revenue from assemblies and solutions were $1 million or 13% of total Company revenue. Revenue from engineering services was 0.1 million or 1% of total Company revenue. Infrared components sales increased approximately 283,000 or 9%, primarily due to an increase in shipments against an annual contract for an international military program. This contract was also renewed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for a higher dollar value than in the previous year. Visible component sales decreased approximately $1.2 million or 31%. All this is primarily due to the ongoing trend in China excuse me, in the telecom industry in general this quarter, we also experienced declines in Europe due to recessionary conditions, particularly in Germany and in the U.S. due to the timing of Defense contract deliveries. Assembly Solutions revenue decreased approximately 241,000 or 20%, and that's primarily due to timing of shipments against a multi-year contract with a defense customer that was partially offset by the addition of VisaNet revenue.\r\n Gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately $2.2 million, a decrease of 1.1 million or 33% as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Total cost of sales was approximately $5.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to approximately $5.2 million for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 30% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 38% for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. And the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is due to the decrease in visible component sales, which typically have higher margins than our IR components product group, which comprised a greater portion of our sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n Selling general administrative costs were approximately $2.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, a decrease of approximately $172,000 or 6% as compared to approximately $3 million for the same quarter the prior fiscal year. The decrease in SG&A costs was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in wage.\r\n The net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately 1.7 million or $0.05 basic and diluted loss per share compared to 0.7 million or $0.09 basic and diluted loss per share for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase in net loss of approximately $1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the decrease in revenue and gross margin, partially offset by other income of approximately 190,000 from our Chinese subsidiary for the return of funds previously misappropriated by our former Chinese management team as a result of the ongoing legal proceedings. This is the last bit of activity that we expect to have related. So that situation, our EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31st, 2023 was a loss of approximately 454,000 compared to an income of 207,000 for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lower sales and gross margin, again, partially offset by the mentioned Chinese since October.\r\n Turning to the results for the first half of fiscal 2024, revenue was $15.4 million, only a 3% decrease from $15.8 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Sales of infrared components were $7.4 million or 48% of the Company's consolidated revenue for the first half of fiscal 2024, revenue from visible components was 5.4 million or 35% of consolidated revenue. Revenue from assemblies and solutions were $2.2 million or 15% of the total company revenue and revenue from engineering services was $0.4 million or 2% of total Company revenue in the first half of the fiscal year, infrared components sales increased almost 1 million or 14%, primarily due to increase in shipments against an annual contract for international military programs. Visible component revenue decreased approximately 1.8 million or 25%. Again, this is primarily due to the ongoing trend in China and the telecom industry in general. However, we also experienced declines in Europe due to recessionary conditions and in the U.S. due to timing of Defense contract shipments. Assembly Solutions revenue increased approximately 150,000 or 7%, primarily due to the addition of Visy made revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease in shipments against the multiyear contract that I mentioned regarding the quarter.\r\n If I take a step back and look at Red revenue. Our visible components are declining. However, in the first half, revenue increased in infrared components, assemblies and solutions and engineering services, which aligns well with our strategic plans. As of December 31st, 2023, we had working capital of approximately $9.1 million and total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 5.9 million, of which greater than 25% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash provided by operations was approximately 851,000 for the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to cash used in operations of approximately 751,000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Cash provided by operations for the first half of fiscal 2024 was largely driven by a decrease in accounts receivable as sales were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 than in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2024. Cash used in operations in the first half of fiscal 2023 reflected a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during that period, resulting from the payment of certain expenses related to previously disclosed events that occurred at our Chinese subsidiaries. Capital expenditures were approximately 1.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to approximately 412,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The spending in the first half of fiscal 2024 is largely driven by the Orlando facility expansion in excuse me, where we constructed additional tenant improvements in our Orlando facility, subject to our continuing lease of which the landlord agreed to provide $2.4 million in tenant improvement allowances. The balance of the tenant improvement cost is estimated to be $3.7 million during the first half of fiscal 2024. We expended 994,000 towards this project with the remaining estimated 380,000 expected to be expended during the second half of fiscal 2024, pending the final construction invoices, we also expended approximately 722,000 net of cash acquired to acquire VISaer made during the first half of fiscal 2024. Our total backlog at December 31st, 2023, was approximately $21.2 million, a decrease of 28% as compared to $29.4 million as of December 31st, 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2023. Our total backlog decreased by 2% during the first half of fiscal 2024. The decrease in backlog during the first half of fiscal 2024 is primarily due to shipments of several annual and multi-year contract renewals, which orders were added to the backlog in prior periods. In the second quarter of previous years, we have typically received a contract renewal from our largest cloud customer for infrared products made of germanium. However, as previously discussed, we have decided to reduce the amount of optics we produce from germanium, both to reduce real, do reduce our risk of supply chain disruption and more importantly, to work with customers to convert their systems to use the optics made of our own Black Diamond materials. As such, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we did not book our typical annual renewal order for germanium optics for this customer and said, we continue to work with this customer as well as other customers converter systems to use Black Diamond optics.\r\n With this review of our financial highlights and recent developments concluded, I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Jaeson Schmidt, Lake Street.\n\nJaeson Schmidt\n\nYes, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start with the Lockheed program. You mentioned unit production units might begin even before the decision date. Just curious if this is something you're hearing from the customer or is this industry chatter?\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nI guess, a combination of both both, but as you know, but directly from the customer, this is the customer is actually extremely confident in this solution and the superiority of this solution and they want us to start setting up some production lines of physical production line in Orlando, where we're going to do production in the very near future to start gearing up to this expectation is that once the decision is made, the Army will want units as soon as possible and they're willing to make some bets in that direction.\n\nJaeson Schmidt\n\nYes, Chad, no, that's certainly good to hear. And that leads me to my next question. And I know it's going to be dependent on the program, but at a high level, how should we think about your total revenue capacity now with the expansion completed in Orlando?\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes, exactly. As you said that the very dependent on the program, if we were to continue with the current business mix, meaning not a lot of cameras in the and mainly growth coming from infrared assemblies, then revenue capacity in Orlando before altogether would probably go to could go to as much as EUR50 million, I think or even though even below the current expansion, I think we should do 60 to 70 million.\r\n Okay.\r\n But very, very dependent on where that comes from if it's individual components, but probably less the more complicated things, the less space per dollar of revenues that they take and the more we would grow the assembly of the Lockheed, for example, or any of the cameras actually doesn't require an enormous amount of space. A lot of it is very automated calibration systems and assembly processes. And so we can probably serve this entire Lockheed program from the clean room, extra clean room space.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nWe built in Orlando and still have room to expand in other programs as well in the multi-mission, Josh, that's really helpful.\n\nJaeson Schmidt\n\nAnd then just the last one from me and I'll jump back into queue. I know China is becoming less of a focus for you guys but just curious if you think that business has bottomed yet.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes, I definitely think it has bottomed. I mean, in reality, you know, at least if you talk about China or Asia. Most of our revenue in what we call the China operation actually comes out of out of China and from Thailand from Vietnam customers that we call, we bundle it in the China part, but it's not really in China. Our revenue in China is very low, and we're not counting on that part really recovering if you would to anything near what it was I mean, just to recap the China operation, we're delivering about 12 million of revenue in 2020, and it is down to EUR3 million. And so all that EUR9 billion of revenues that vanished in China was really made up for in the US and Europe and which is why you have the growth in US and Europe or it's very strong even if the consolidated numbers structures.\n\nJaeson Schmidt\n\nOkay.\r\n Understood.\r\n Okay.\r\n Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nScott Buck, H.C. Wainwright.\n\nScott Buck\n\nHi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions for Dan. You mentioned in the release the I know on the call here the acceleration of reduction for the Lockheed project. I'm curious whether the geopolitical environment is causing you to see kind of similar uptick in demand or acceleration of interest in other parts of the business.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nBut yes, definitely, I mean, we've heard some uptake and in some areas of the business, for example, customers amidst well that builds some of the home and the systems for Vision Systems for the Israeli military and so on had had a big push on the orders to rebuild some systems that were destroyed the on October seventh from during the war. And of course, Ukraine continues indirectly to drive some demand for some of the optics, and that's just beginning to grow. I think the US is only now really starting to replenish. Some of the inventory is depleted some unfortunately, we don't make ammunition directly, which is from what I understand, one of the things that is the most shortage, but definitely the optics and the cameras that go on some of these the drones and loitering munition of growing demand and pipeline.\n\nScott Buck\n\nAnd a follow-up to an earlier question is it sounds like you guys have the capacity to be able to handle, not just the Lucky project, but also perhaps one of these other potential deals you're working on as well, right?\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes, absolutely. I think when it comes to those kind of projects that all tens of millions of dollars in potential revenue. We probably with the capacity we have worldwide and balancing things worldwide can probably handle two, maybe even three of some great.\n\nScott Buck\n\nAnd then last one for me. I'm curious, how are you thinking about the unrestricted cash balance here and how that it bridges you to 2026 and beyond when maybe some of these larger deals kick in, we also ventured into this quarter?\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes.\r\n Great. Great question. So baked into this quarter, we actually were or this first half of the year, we were operating cash flow positive and we'll continue to be operating cash flow positive. Cash has gone down in the first half. That's largely because of the Orlando facility. We're still still paying invoices still receiving and paying invoices there and the investment of another coating machine that we made in Riga. But the big chunks of that CapEx spend for this fiscal year's over. So in the second half of the fiscal year, we're just going to dribble out on the normal actually below average CapEx. So from a cash flow perspective, I feel pretty confident that we'll be.\r\n Okay.\n\nScott Buck\n\nI mean that's it for me, guys. Thanks a lot.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nThank you, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nBrian Kinstlinger, Alliance Global.\n\nBrian Kinstlinger\n\nHi there.\r\n This is Trevor on for Brian. And my first question pertains to your backlog. Last, you mentioned that despite the lost revenue from annuals through your germanium contracts, that you're working on transitioning this IMiD to drive some meaningful backlog starting in 2Q. Did that happen this quarter? And if so, is there a sizable portion of the backlog that's attributable to some of that you quantified?\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes, definitely the Lockheed Martin, 4.7 million portion in the backlog and that entered during Q2 is purely visit as well as a few other smaller projects. But but right now, I'd say around 5 million of the backlog probably is felt because of it.\n\nBrian Kinstlinger\n\nOkay.\r\n Thank you. And then secondly, with the Lockheed partnership, just wanted to clarify, is Lightpath competing with anyone for the component that you're creating for Lockheed?\r\n Or is it guaranteed that if Lockheed selected that Lightpath will be in every delivered missile the latter, we will be the sole source and Lockheed part, and it's a very big deal.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nThat's why Lockheed actually was extremely supportive of our acquisition of estimate from their point of view, it's a significant bet that they made in that direction. And at the time they decided, oh, we're going to decide on it with them. It was a standalone nine people company. And so the acquisition of the visit by LightPath actually played a major role in this, and I sort of gave peace of mind to Lockheed in it, but we are definitely on the only one developing that part for Lucky.\n\nBrian Kinstlinger\n\nGreat.\r\n That's great to hear.\r\n Last question.\r\n While I appreciate the strong demand from the defense industry, although we know it's like, you know, lumpy and can be unpredictable. Your products and Mantas specifically has really strong commercial applications like the flame detection recycling centers that you've mentioned in the past couple of quarters. So how do you go about building a healthy portion of a backlog that is more predictable? Like are you doing anything there like looking to hire more personnel, increased marketing spend, et cetera, just trying to get an idea.\r\n Thanks.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nNo, that's a great question. And really a lot of our focus now is around sales and soon will be on the marketing of those products. So far, if you look at myself as CEO, I tend to move around the business and focus my time on where it's needed. And right now, absolutely my time is focused on the sales of these new cameras, new product, and we're building up more in the sales team with tooling up to align ourselves to that.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nAnd we're working very hard to lock in some strategic partnerships in some of those areas.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nAgain, we can't do everything. It's we're just we're not going to build a sales team now that will go off the 500 different camera companies company customers for cameras, and so strategic relationship and alliances with key players in some of those areas of firefighting of process control of drones, and they're going to be key for fast scaling up.\r\n And then in relation to the backlog and the fire detection for which we already have a running business for those cameras. They're not going to give us annual orders and they give us a forecast and we work off of that. So we'll never see that in the backlog.\n\nBrian Kinstlinger\n\nAll right. Great.\r\n Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\r\n Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nGlenn Mattson, Ladenburg.\n\nGlenn Mattson\n\nHi.\r\n Thanks for taking the question. So it was about seven months ago that China made the announcement of the export ban for medium. So at the time, I thank you for standing by mentioned a timeframe of like how long it takes to your customers to design and get your alternatives through the kind of nine to 12 month timeframe. And so I guess I'm curious about how that's going and if there should be some expectation of of that to start to kick in kind of in the second calendar half of this year. And and that may also relate to the one customer didn't renew yet on the backlog side just to use them, as example, but just across the customers that in general, can you give us a sense of how that process has gone up so that that's a great question.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nAnd frankly, it's going really well. I mentioned a couple of customers, an example. One of them is that largest customer for the sporting part, you know, typically our annual orders from that customer have been between 46 million as much as 6.5 million, I think, on one year and we haven't renewed that. Our expectation now is really four the entire product line of that customer to possibly convert to using Black Diamond materials. What we're seeing is that things have gone gotten even worse with germanium At first, I think many customers were still accessing germanium through inventories to Romania maybe was making its way out of China in different ways and different creative ways that play. But that is decreasing significantly. And as of now from what we know China has given zero export licenses to any germanium is at its final destination in the U.S. And so they're very very specific in sort of what they're going after there. And so we have two large customers for handheld devices, gun sights, binoculars and so on. They probably have around $10 million of potential revenue between the two of them, both of them. We're working very hard to convert over the next week. I think we're actually shipping some more samples to do to them. One of them already converted one product, I would say, which I mentioned it during the short term, they announced the new product and they also made it very clear at the SHOT Show to ourselves and anyone else that was asking that all new products are being designed only with Black Diamond now.\r\n So I think we're doing we're doing very well, I wish it could be faster than the time it takes.\r\n But the but unfortunately, doing some of those also require some of the capacity and capabilities that is used for day-to-day production and we can't disrupt it too much.\r\n So it's a balance we play.\r\n But I think I'm sorry, Glenn, it took some Chinese made the announcement in July, and I would say, and Sam, you can disagree, but it took until maybe November and December for the customers to start feeling.\n\nGlenn Mattson\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nOf that announcement and start to scramble looking for a solution. And our conversations with those customers didn't give them confidence that they were going to continue to get dramatic, right? So when it was clear that we weren't going to solve weren't going to be able to solve their germanium problem that prompted them to take action.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nBut it took, I would say, a good six months before they realize that was real Yes, which is why our largest customer first wanted just one product we designed.\r\n But as we were working on that, they started realizing how difficult the situation is and immediately switched over to saying let's redefine everything.\r\n Right, right.\n\nGlenn Mattson\n\nOkay, great. That's very helpful on the backdrop and I don't know if you'd be pursuing morale, but could you give us a sense of as you look at your back half of your fiscal year, you know, you mentioned in the prepared remarks the view about European recessionary conditions and things like that. Can you just give us a sense of how you feel about and, you know, all the factors coming together with that potential of this or if there's any potential further disruption from the lack of supply or the supply drying up on the germanium side or and then maybe the new designs back in India or maybe there's some revenue coming through on the manpower side of things like that. Can you just give us a general sense of how you're feeling about the revenue top line and in 2H versus 1H?\r\n Yes.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nSo it's interesting that the situation, the softening in Europe is really more around the visible optics where there's a lot more competition globally and a lot of price pressure. But our production capacity and all that kind of good stuff. And those products tend to have industrial applications that sort of deliver next where, as you know, deliver more to consumer oriented products. And that's where we're seeing the softening the infrared side because the infrared components, even without the major the major contracts on the infrared side, we're still seeing growth in Europe and in the U.S. and demand in Europe, Europe and the U.S. for infrared components and the assemblies and solution type start of the business. But where we're seeing the sort of the the economics impact is on the visible component side. And again, they tend to lead towards a more direct path to a consumer product. So that's what we're seeing in Europe. And I don't I don't have a crystal ball and I don't say the recession word, if you Google, a Europeans are like we were a year ago, nobody wants to see the recession word, but there are economies or contracts.\n\nGlenn Mattson\n\nRight, right. That's helpful. So then when you factor that in plus all the other moving parts and when you think about the top line outlook, can you give us any DARRELL sense of directionally how you feel about the second half versus first half? And that's it for me.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nSo my gut tells me that this this past Q2 was the softest quarter, we're going to experience. So in Q3, we should see a little bit of an uptick in Q4 and a little bit of an uptick. Again, it's the visible components that sort of what we worry about and you kind of nailed it with that, but they're in decline regardless. So it's just happening a bit faster than we would have predicted six months or a year ago.\n\nGlenn Mattson\n\nOkay, great.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Gene Inger, ingerletter.com.\r\n Mr. Inger, you're line is open? You had it muted on your end.\n\nGene Inger\n\nYeah, you hear me now.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, we do. Thank you.\n\nGene Inger\n\nI apologize. I muted that has occurred. And as Sam, I hope you're feeling better high now as well.\r\n And my first question, I'd like to start with something you haven't touched on, which is the annual meeting and the paperwork that was pending due to that problems from the previous management before you guys began an enormous task of turning around this small company. And I'm wondering if you can tell us if all of that is not of concern to shareholders.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes, absolutely. Thanks. I appreciate it. Definitely could have touched on that. I'm very, very glad to see that it's all completely resolved now. And to recap, it was pointed out by some external group that there were some problems in the registration of the company that went back all the way to 1995 when the 71 split of reverse split was done and was done incorrectly or so. And so we had to postpone the annual shareholder meeting to it filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery Court for a collection of the registration since we couldn't go back and locate all shareholders from 1995 to have them rebuild that. And all of that is behind us last week the day before the Annual Shareholder Meeting, the court ruled on that of fixed leverage inflation and well done. We're in very good standing now. And I think I can say that at this point, every single issue that we have found in the last three years since been fixed, just very briefly, let me ask you a couple of more questions.\n\nGene Inger\n\nOne, Scott Harris, Chairman of the Board, and I appreciate the new Board members by the way, the former major general as well as a business manager, I believe, brought over from Luminor. A are you bringing in more people intentionally from Luminor? And B, is there a any linkage between Lightpath and the private company that Scott is the CEO of called inflection book. And I mentioned that because the Pentagon is in the process of jump-starting at several key application. I wondered if some of that includes quantum computing photonics? And I wonder if this is or can involve Lightpath in the future.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes. Well, first of all, we're not the poaching specifically on luminal and and I don't think with targeting specifically, it doesn't happen to be that the luminal has recruited some great people over the years and there are some opportunities that have come up in which we recruited people that were in the past and moving out even the near past of the long-term past has some great people joined us from their end.\r\n Secondly, as it comes to Scott, the new venture, which is extremely interesting about did encourage everyone to take a look at that inflection and like many things that is extremely heavy on photonics and Quantum, all things, Quantum, Quantum sensors, quantum computing, Quantum communication. They are all very photonics oriented and driven. We have a very strong person species in free space, optical communication, primarily in space. And that ties very much directly into science at Quantum communication and also indirectly into some of the quantum of work that is being worked on by many companies in friction being one of them. And we'll always be very happy to see optics find finding more uses and more places to be. I get an extreme Joy out of even the simplest thing we're seeing is that the quantum engine might be replacing something as simple as the radio receivers.\n\nGene Inger\n\nAnd it's mind-blowing to see optics play a role in something like radio communications and any of it relate as well to enemy submarines and to detection systems because I know you're doing spacecraft went down communication, you haven't really touched on that with anymore specificity. Can you can you elaborate?\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes, we have actually a couple of cameras systems that are one of them we're going to have any day now. I think a version of Mantas that we're going to release that are of extreme interest for this for threat detection and counter-UAS detection, Texor detection of cruise missiles as they come in and other things all of those. We have two cameras systems, two separate camera systems that we're working with customers on that show very, very promising results in that directly.\n\nGene Inger\n\nDo these relate to the U.S. Navy licenses, we haven't heard much more about.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes, the U.S. leaving license enables a lot of that. And as I mentioned, we expect within the next two to three weeks to release the first material formally from the from the Navy license BD&L for. But in reality, the Mantas came about it has already been using those materials for over a year now we simply are now formally announcing yet the material made available to us.\n\nGene Inger\n\nI think you have mentioned one that your 100 Mantos cameras likely produced or sold this year, does this year mean fiscal year or are you talking about this calendar year and this fiscal year?\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nPretty much on track for that?\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nI think.\n\nGene Inger\n\nOkay. Now I would like to ask you was just an overview. The military has been stunned by the Gaza war and by Ukraine because they see the swarming of drones and how that offsets not only jet fighter aircraft and maybe you're working on the F-35, maybe not of the improvements, but also there you don't want to fire a million dollar missile intercept, the $5,000 cheap drones that we've learned in the Red Sea. So I wonder whether Lightpath benefits or suffers from the prospect of fewer costly missile systems and that would intercept or work that Tom and I hope to have that in the future.\n\nAlbert Miranda\n\nYes. Yes. Well, once we are done with the development of the Lockheed missile and hopefully one Smith for such as awarded to Lockheed my my personal wishes and see if I have a mid-cycle and everything, they see a development or even a butterfly. And but realistically, I think what we're seeing is a very strong drive towards integrating more and more passive detection capabilities such as infrared cameras for detecting some of those drones today, you simply cannot use a radar for detecting the drones coming in for something the Ukraine has taught us and have learned. Unfortunately, it's very hard to wait as well doesn't suffer that because of fighting an adversary such as the Teva organization and not a state, but in Ukraine, Russia wall, for example, in what is called in and near of adversarial and adversaries that has capabilities close to yours. You suddenly realize you cannot use a radar to detecting drones because the moment you turn it on and mid-funnel is locked onto the V12 and we'll help you within minutes seconds and sort of the use of cameras is very important to have our camera that I mentioned for detecting threats from a distance one version of Mantas and one version of the different camera of extreme importance because they can do that in $10,000 as opposed to a CAD50,000 cameras that is often used today. So I think we have something very unique there that that will pay off really well.\n\nGene Inger\n\nSam, now that Thank you. I feel better, and I appreciate the aspirational goals that you have outlined in the presentations as well lately. And I know it takes time and I know how hard it is. So good luck, and we'll keep watching it.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nThank you, Jake, and thank you very well.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sam Rubin for any closing remarks.\n\nShmuel Rubin\n\nThank you. I appreciate everyone's joining the call and the patience that our shareholders show that we are not only turning around the Company but also plotting the new direction.\r\n And now finally delivering on it big time, the Lockheed Martin, the automotive, the cameras each one of those are tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue that will be coming down the road, very big deal. The company is going to look completely different a few years from now, and I'm excited to continue along this path.\r\n Thank you, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For much of the past year, investors have been pressing US companies to cut debt levels and shore up their balance sheets as borrowing costs have risen. Those days may be ending, though, and the results could hurt corporate debt while boosting stocks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden\u2019s Attempt to Address Memory Issue Backfires With New Gaffe China\u2019s Property Crisis Is Starting to Ripple Across the World A 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on China New York City Is Considering a Laundry Pods Crackdown Putin Takes Hard Line on Ukraine in Tucker Carlson Interview\n\nLast month, about a third of the S&P 500 companies that reported earnings ended up raising their dividends, according to credit strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. With bond yields broadly having fallen since October, companies are looking at borrowing to help boost returns for shareholders. Acquisitions, often funded with debt, are also picking up after two slower years, the strategists said.\n\nConcerns about risks for bondholders are filtering into markets. For the two weeks ended Thursday, high-grade US corporate spreads, or risk premiums, widened two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, according to Bloomberg index data, while the S&P 500 gained 2.2%. Those trends could persist this year, JPMorgan strategists led by Eric Beinstein and Nathaniel Rosenbaum wrote in a note this week.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say definitively that companies have shifted in the direction of favoring shareholders, said Robert Cohen, head of global developed credit at DoubleLine Capital, which oversees about $95 billion in assets. But he said it\u2019s something that corporate-bond investors should watch for.\n\n\u201cIf the equity market has run a lot and earnings lose momentum, a way to generate further shareholder returns would be through leverage,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThese are things to watch for as potential risks for 2024.\u201d\n\nThere have been some examples of companies selling debt to fund shareholder friendly moves recently. Insurance provider Cigna Group borrowed $4.5 billion in the high-grade market on Monday partly to help fund share buybacks. Lockheed Martin Corp., the world\u2019s largest weapons maker, last month raised $2 billion in part to fund share repurchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spokesperson for Cigna said that a majority of the proceeds of their bond offering will refinance debt, and that it doesn\u2019t expect any share buybacks to have a material impact on its credit metrics or shift its previously disclosed financial policies or capital allocation strategy. A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said that the strength of the company\u2019s balance sheet gives it the flexibility to be opportunistic with its share repurchases.\n\nInvestment-grade companies have sold more than $230 billion of bonds this year through Thursday, up about 30% from the same period in 2023. Last month saw the most blue-chip bond sales for a January on record.\n\nCompanies are selling bonds because it\u2019s become so much cheaper for them: Average yields on corporate bonds have fallen about 1.1 percentage point since mid-October, to 5.3% as of Thursday\u2019 close. Those borrowing costs have dropped because investors are scrambling to buy bonds and lock in relatively high levels of income before the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates this year.\n\nCorporations\u2019 eagerness to borrow is another reason why high-grade corporate bond spreads probably won\u2019t narrow much from current levels, JPMorgan strategists said in a separate note on Friday.\n\nSome bond sales in recent months have stirred the attention of credit ratings agencies. When aerospace and defense giant RTX Corp. sold $6 billion of bonds in November to help repay a short-term loan to help fund its $10 billion share-buyback, both Moody\u2019s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings shifted the outlook on RTX\u2019s rating to negative from stable due to its debt load following the share-buyback announcement. RTX declined to comment.\n\nCompanies are taking advantage of strong investor demand for high-grade bonds, according to Blair Shwedo, head of fixed-income sales and trading at U.S. Bank. A lot of the corporations taking shareholder friendly steps have ample cash cushions and are less likely to see a meaningful impact on their credit metrics, he added. Still, a meaningful increase in new issue supply to help fund shareholder-friendly moves may weigh on high-grade debt.\n\n\u201cIt does have the potential to push spreads wider over time if we start to see companies lever up their balance sheets,\u201d said Shwedo.\n\nEven if the risk isn\u2019t high in the near term, it could be an issue longer term, said Travis King, head of US investment-grade corporates at Voya Investment Management.\n\n\u201cAn increase in share buybacks and leverage will start to set the stage for the next sell off in credit spreads, leaving overall investment-grade fundamentals more vulnerable the next time we see a slowdown in growth,\u201d King said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman\u2019s 33-Year-Old Lieutenant How Jack Dorsey\u2019s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went South Inside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong A Tiny Fund Takes a Big Short on Corporate Debt Maturity Wall Lagging Fertility Rate Means Diapers Aren\u2019t Just for Babies Anymore\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Defense stocks consists of equities investors turn toward during economic or geopolitical tumult. These can include manufacturing giants of planes, drones, tanks and other products used during conflicts. These days there is not only a war in Ukraine but also one in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAs a result, many investors have invested in defense stocks but not all have been good bets. Below are three, sorry defense stocks to sell in February.\n\nBoeing (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is a stock that\u2019s been going through a crisis of confidence in terms of its manufacturing capabilities, despite over decades the company has developed itself into a leading manufacturer of commercial and military aircraft, satellites, and rockets. There were two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jet in 2019 and 2020.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMost recently, the emergency exit door bolts of a 737-MAX owned by Alaska Airlines flew off mid-flight, causing a depressurization event. While no one was seriously harmed, Boeing\u2019s reputation certainly was. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in turn, halted the expansion of 737-MAX manufacturing. Alaska Airlines CEO grounded the 737-MAX jets and mentioned the company had found more loose-bolts in many 737-MAX planes.\n\nMoreover, the 737-MAX planes are not the only Boeing jets with manufacturing woes. There have been\u00a0delays in the highly anticipated 737X and 777X programs, which would compete with Airbus\u2019s A320neo and A350, respectively, have come to again tarnish the manufacturer\u2019s reputation.\n\nThese delays and manufacturing inadequacies have, of course, blighted Boeing\u2019s share performance. The aircraft manufacturer\u2019s stock is down more than 20% for the year, and investors are perhaps better off selling now before things get worse.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130J Super Hercules of the United States Air Force performing at Aero India 2017.\n\nSource: Joe Ravi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the largest U.S. weapons and military equipment manufacturers, deriving 73% of net sales from selling military equipment to the U.S. government in fiscal year 2022. The firm is also a global leader in aerospace and defense manufacturing, prodding products and services for military, civil and commercial customers worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin has in the past benefitted from stable demand for its products and services from both domestic and international customers. Of course, much of this growth admittedly comes from the\u00a0ever-burgeoning U.S. defense budget.\n\nThe weapons manufacturer\u2019s stock skyrocketed after the October 7 attack in Israel, as investors anticipated a strong response from Israel. However, as the Gaza War has continued with any clear end, investors have begun to soften their optimism on LMT shares. Lockheed Martin\u2019s stock has fallen nearly 7% YTD.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) A photograph of the underside of a Northrop Grumman stealth bomber.\n\nSource: Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is another weapons manufacturer that received a boost after the October 7 attacks in Israel, jumping more than 8% on that day. For those who don\u2019t know Northrop Grumman is known for developing drones and missile defense systems. The defense firm generated more than $39 billion in revenue and $2 billion in net income over the past twelve months.\n\nShares have traded downward since the start of trading in January. That is on top of the stock falling 13% in 2023. The company\u2019s costly B-21 Stealth Bomber program with the U.S. Airforce was primarily to blame. Northrop\u2019s fourth quarter earnings came in at a loss due to a $1.2 billion charge related to the running costs of the program.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "15 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 most powerful Asian countries in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis on the economic potential and race for power in the world\u2019s largest continent by heading over to the 5 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024.\n\nAsia\u2019s Corporate Power\n\nWestern observers have been talking about Asia\u2019s future potential for quite some time, and that future is catching up faster than expected. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, Asia, which in the year 2000 accounted for less than one-third of the world\u2019s GDP in purchasing power parity terms, is poised to make up more than 50% of the global economy by 2040. In addition to this, Asia will also account for about 40% of the world\u2019s consumption by then.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers has forecast that China alone would constitute 20% of the world\u2019s GDP by 2050, while India will surpass the United States to become the second largest economy in the world, with Indonesia being fourth biggest economic power. All of these projections reiterate what many experts have long been saying, that this is going to be Asia\u2019s century.\n\nOver the last decade or so, several large corporations including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have outsourced some of their operations to Asian countries, for reasons ranging from cheap skillful labor to the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge market size in the continent.\n\nToday, 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iPhone, iPads, and MacBooks are made in China \u2013 the country which also happened to be the source of 20% of the company\u2019s overall revenue in 2022. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also making inroads in the Indian market. Its first retail store in the country was inaugurated last year in Mumbai.\n\nThere has been an uptick in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investments in Asia as well. In 2021, the company announced to set up a new data center in Indonesia, which is expected to increase revenues for the tech giant by $6.3 billion. Moreover, the International Data Corporation (IDC) has noted that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is likely to add to $39 billion and create 100,000 new jobs in the UAE\u2019s economy between 2022 and 2026 through its cloud based services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAsian corporations themselves contribute about $19 trillion to the world economy each year, according to a report. The continent is home to some of the largest corporations in the world, like Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), TATA Group, and Reliance Industries, among others.\n\nThe Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) holds a 12% share of the world\u2019s automobile industry. 11.2 million vehicles were sold by the company in 2023, which secured Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)\u2019s status as the top automaker for the fourth successive year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the largest producer of semiconductors in the world, holding a 60% share of the global market. In 2023, it even beat the likes of Intel and Samsung in revenue, according to a report.\n\nRace for Power in Asia\n\nSeveral economic powerhouses in Asia have begun leveraging their financial strength to enhance their military capabilities. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), about 25% of the world\u2019s military expenditure of $2.2 trillion in 2022 was incurred by Asian countries.\n\nDefense expenditure has spiked 45% in the continent over the past decade, with the steepest rise seen in South Asia (46%) and East Asia (50%) \u2013 the two major flashpoints in the region. The threat of China invading Taiwan is higher today than it has ever been. The US has been ramping up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, and has approved sales of weapons worth billions to Taipei lately.\n\nLast year in March, Washington approved the sale of weapons worth $619 million for Taiwan, including 100 AGM-88B HARM and 200 AMRAAM missiles for its F-16 fleet. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are the primary contractors of the deal. South Korea is also set to receive up to 25 F-35 fighter jets developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) from the US for a deal worth $5 billion, amid increasing aggression from Pyongyang and Beijing.\n\nOil-rich countries in the Middle East are also racking up their defense capabilities. The trend has picked up pace especially after the Arab Spring of 2010 that rattled several Arab monarchies. Saudi Arabia for instance has become the fifth largest spender on defense, having incurred over $75 billion in 2022, which included a $3 billion agreement with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to acquire 300 MIM-104E Patriot missiles.\n\nAmerican defense contractors are also expanding their presence in the Middle East, as part of the strategic ties between the US and its Arab allies. Earlier this week, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had signed agreements with Saudi firms to manufacture parts of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system in the kingdom. 15 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFour weighted metrics have been considered to rank the most powerful Asian countries in 2024. These are economic strength (40%), military strength (35%), political power (15%), and cultural influence (10%). We observed where every Asian country ranked on each metric in the region and then assigned them weighted scores for those metrics. Finally, these scores were aggregated to have an overall score. Countries in this article are listed in descending order of their overall scores.\n\nData on military strength has been sourced from our recent article, 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024. To determine economic rank, we referred to IMF\u2019s figures on nominal GDP for 2023. Brand Finance\u2019s Global Soft Power Index 2023 was consulted for political soft power of countries, while we used CEO World\u2019s rankings for cultural influence.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.
